<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 399: Divination</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji slowly put down his tea cup and sighed deeply, saying: "Master Lin has managed the Myriad Medicine Sect with such diligence and care, it truly hasn't been easy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Past events should be let go like the wind, everything moves forward. Today, you should maintain an open and understanding mind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Within the four seas, all land belongs to the king, within the realm, everywhere is declared national territory. Since the Sect Master can understand the bigger picture, the nation's generous reward naturally goes without saying."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo stood up, stepped forward with his head bowed, and said solemnly: "Master Lin's righteousness is truly admirable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"In my childhood when the Ning family was in trouble, we were fortunate to receive help from Myriad Medicine Sect, saving us from danger. The Ning family will never forget this for generations. I am grateful for this kindness but haven't been able to repay it. Today, I am fortunate to meet the Sect Master, and again receive Sister Shanshan's care in many ways. I have no way to repay this, I can only feel deep shame and embarrassment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Today's incident arose suddenly, the situation was urgent. It was truly an accidental discovery that accidentally touched important treasures. Through this coincidence, I unexpectedly stirred up huge waves, causing the Sect Master to activate the mountain-guarding formation with killing intent. I did what I did because I feared for my life, not because I wanted to. I truly had no choice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Lin Shanshan's expression changed immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">She looked at Ning Zhuo with a complex expression, overflowing with resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Although she wasn't very experienced, she had been carefully nurtured by Lin Bufan and lived by his side, learning through observation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">So when Ning Zhuo spoke these seemingly apologetic words, Lin Shanshan knew immediately that Ning Zhuo was thrusting a sharp sword at her father.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Lin Bufan smiled on the surface but coldly snorted in his heart: "This brat's tongue is sharp, trying to justify himself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"If it was purely accidental, how did Zhu Xuanji happen to arrive here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">On the surface, Lin Bufan laughed and said some polite words, indicating that Lin Shanshan's disappearance was the reason for such aggressive actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This was also turning black into white.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The truth was that Lin Bufan had first captured Ning Jiufan and activated the mountain-guarding formation, which then caused Ning Zhuo to kidnap Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo naturally wouldn't allow Lin Bufan to distort the facts like this, and immediately argued back, though on the surface it still sounded like a junior's apology.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The two engaged in a war of words, which the audience found interesting at first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Gradually, as their verbal sparring continued, it seemed to become endless and unceasing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zhu Xuanji grew impatient listening to this and had to raise his hand: "Stop, both of you stop!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He indicated that arguing was useless, and suggested they should go look at the Linglong Mirror Wall first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Lin Bufan stroked his beard with a smile, agreeing while "gently" looking at Ning Zhuo, inwardly snorting coldly: "Little fox!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo wore an apologetic expression, indicating that Elder Brother Zhu's admonishment was correct, while his eyes warned Lin Bufan, thinking: "Old fox!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Looking back, he saw Lin Shanshan staring at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo smiled brightly: "Miss Lin..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Lin Shanshan turned away: "Master Ning Zhuo, don't speak to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Lin Bufan felt warmth in his heart, and revealed some more truth: The Linglong Mirror Wall was indeed a spiritual treasure of extremely high grade. Even after his repeated attempts to probe it, he had never seen the actual wall body. Just the outer layers of formations had stumped him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"These formations themselves don't belong to the Reflection Wall, but were jointly arranged by several formation masters' projections."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"When our sect moved here, the original mountain god had permeated for over a hundred years, and only managed to penetrate the outer two layers of formations, creating a secret passage connecting to the underground caves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Lin Bufan advised everyone with outward sincerity not to have too high expectations for this mission, as he had never been able to control this spiritual treasure. If the action wasn't successful, it wasn't because he, Lin Bufan, was unwilling to cooperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Jiufan stroked his beard with a solemn expression: "If what Sect Master Lin says is true, and the Reflection Wall contains countless techniques of the ancestors, then it's truly formidable. If we anger the spiritual treasure during our mission and it retaliates, we might all be in mortal danger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Hearing this, Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly, as this was also his concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">So, he turned to look at Shen Lingshu beside him: "Please, Elder Shen, before we proceed, perform some divination!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Shen Lingshu nodded: "This is indeed why I was ordered to come here, to lend you assistance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo immediately looked curiously at Shen Lingshu, thinking: "Divination?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Divination was one of the hundred arts of cultivation, and he had longed to learn this skill for a long time. Seeing a divination cultivator today, he felt a newfound curiosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"This Elder Shen not only has Nascent Soul level cultivation, but was also sent here by the Southern Bean Royal Family, he must be quite skilled in divination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"When I get the chance, I must try to get close to him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Shen Lingshu suddenly felt his heart skip a beat, producing a slight sense of unease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His expression became more serious, thinking to himself: "Before taking action, I have a premonition - could this mission be quite unfavorable?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He had originally planned to only use eighty percent of his power, but now disturbed by this premonition, he immediately decided to perform divination with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At once, he took out his prized treasure from his storage belt - a set of Nascent Soul level divination counting rods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo watched with bright eyes, as this was his first time seeing a great Nascent Soul level cultivator perform divination before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Shen Lingshu gazed deeply, lightly stroking the counting rods in his hand, and spoke: "Everyone's fortune is uneven, with both good and bad mixed. Let me calculate for each person individually, then combine them for a unified calculation to explore the heavenly secrets of this mission."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Everyone had no objections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Shen Lingshu concentrated for a moment, first looking at Ning Jiufan, reaching out his hand to capture Ning Jiufan's aura and transferring it into the counting rods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He threw the counting rods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The counting rods emitted spots of mysterious light, flying through the air before finally hovering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Shen Lingshu calculated the result and said to Ning Jiufan: "You have noble people supporting you, with hidden blessings in your fate. However, your fortune has changed recently due to external forces triggering a change in destiny, with emotions mixed in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Jiufan's face reddened slightly, and he asked: "I've heard that rashly changing one's fate will have backlash, is it..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Shen Lingshu shook his head and comforted him: "This wasn't you actively changing your fate, there are others who casted spells to share your burden, no need to worry."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He turned to Ning Zhuo and continued calculating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Soon, his gaze became icy, and he said directly: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, your fortune is stable, unremarkable, yet within this stability lies hidden opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">After speaking, he then read for Lin Shanshan: "Young friend Lin Shanshan, your fate contains domestic energy, and you should not travel far at this time. Outside there is frost and dew, inside there is warmth protecting you. Staying within the hall will help nurture and strengthen your vital energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Lin Shanshan's expression changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Shen Lingshu then calculated for Lin Bufan, his expression becoming solemn as he said in a deep voice: "Gate Master Lin, your fate is full of wealth and nobility, yet you are uneasy in stillness and find fortune in movement. In the universe, yin and yang flow and transform; after long stillness, movement must appear. If you don't move now, disaster will be hard to avoid. Rise and fall, success and failure, all lie in a moment's thought. Moving towards good fortune and protecting the Myriad Medicine Sect foundation aligns with heaven's will."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The implication was that trouble would come even if one stayed at home.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">These words immediately touched Lin Bufan's heart, and he turned his gaze toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Finally, Shen Lingshu looked at Zhu Xuanji, threw the counting rods, and got an answer: "Friend Zhu, yours is a fate of toil, with extraordinary talent, yet great achievements come only through hardship. Labor brings achievement, your great endeavors will prosper in the future, but this journey requires much patience, with success hanging by a thread. Behind glory, you must have extreme patience to not violate heaven's way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After calculating for everyone, Shen Lingshu silently recited mysterious incantations, maintaining his composure for a long while before throwing the counting rods again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The counting rods combined in mid-air, forming various patterns that made others feel dizzy just looking at them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo stared intently for a while until he felt dizzy and disoriented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Finally, Shen Lingshu collected the counting rods, looked around, and said softly: "According to everyone's fortunes, this journey contains good fortune mixed with stability, no surprises or dangers, no waves, and naturally has assistance. However, the way of heaven is changeable, the gains might not meet expectations, only by maintaining an open mind will you obtain heaven's timing and earth's advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Everyone held their breath and listened intently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo, full of respect, praised: "Elder Shen's divination skills are truly profound and excellent, witnessing them fills me with admiration!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Unexpectedly, Shen Lingshu coldly replied: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, you must know that fate has its limits and heaven's secrets should not be carelessly discussed. In the future, stay away from me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo: ???</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">With the divination complete and such results obtained, everyone began to take action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lin Bufan wanted to leave Lin Shanshan on the original mountain, but she insisted on going, saying she wanted to personally rescue Senior Brother Linghu Jiu. Lin Bufan had no choice but to let her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Lin Bufan opened the secret mountain path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This was the same path Ning Zhuo had used to enter the original mountain from the underground caves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He was essentially returning along his original route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Everyone directly entered the formation within formations, with mist and white haze covering the wilderness, filling their vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Lin Bufan exercised his techniques, waving his sleeves, and the white mist rolled and surged, quickly becoming thin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Just as everyone saw a gate faintly appear, a slim figure penetrated the mist, holding a long sword, walking up to everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">It was Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Master, and honored guests, please wait a moment." Linghu Jiu smiled, suddenly pointing his sword at Ning Zhuo, "Let me first challenge someone with my sword!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Ning Zhuo, how about a match with this foolish brother?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Senior Brother Linghu, what do you mean?" Ning Zhuo's face changed slightly, feeling confused, "The misunderstanding with your sect has already been resolved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">But Linghu Jiu shook his head with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Lin Bufan stroked his beard and suddenly said: "No, you're not Jiu'er, you're just his projection."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Linghu Jiu" nodded, frankly admitting: "My true self has already been guided deeper inside. I was left here for one specific purpose."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">As he spoke, he turned his gaze toward Ning Zhuo, his fighting spirit very intense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo still didn't understand, stating that this definitely wasn't Linghu Jiu's order, he would never treat him like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Shen Lingshu suddenly said: "So that's it, this is the guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo let out an "ah," feeling that Elder Shen, this great divination master, seemed to have something against him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Zhu Xuanji urged: "Then let's make it quick, Ning Zhuo, fight him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Lin Shanshan covered her mouth and smiled: "Suddenly being able to see Senior Brother and Master Ning Zhuo fight, even if it's not Senior Brother himself, is really something to look forward to."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">She was very annoyed with Ning Zhuo's behavior and hoped in her heart that "Linghu Jiu" would teach the big-headed youth a good lesson.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">With Lin Shanshan having such an attitude, Lin Bufan's naturally went without saying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Jiufan stroked his beard: "Little Zhuo, go fight then! Let everyone see the style of a northern man, the Ning family's style!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo showed a bitter smile. Ning Jiufan had great confidence in him, but he knew well that Linghu Jiu was not simple. Even the Life Hanging by a Thread technique could be detected by Linghu Jiu, the man must have hidden many things!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"The battle is dangerous..." Ning Zhuo still held onto hope, not wanting to fight for no reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">At this time, the Five Elements Divine Lord's voice reached everyone's ears: "Kid Ning Zhuo, quickly fight with Linghu Jiu!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"I made a bet with old brother Qiliang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"If you lose, don't come in!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
