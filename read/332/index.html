<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Obviously, Song Fuli had carefully chosen his timing.<br/>
<br/>
The banquet was about to end and the guests were gradually filtering out. If he blocked the door at this moment, it would inevitably lead to an ugly scene.<br/>
<br/>
When the receptionist saw Song Fuli’s actions and realized what was happening, his face immediately paled, breaking out into cold sweat.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to muster up his courage and continue speaking. However, with a single glare from Song Fuli, he felt like he had fallen into an icy cave and was unable to move.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, another receptionist nearby turned around and ran at full speed, stumbling into the banquet hall.<br/>
<br/>
Here, a constant stream of cultivators congregated around the main table, surrounding Ning Zhuo. As the patriarch of the new Ning branch family, Ning Zhuo had to continuously smile and laugh as he accepted toast after toast. This also served to solidify his relationships with these people.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo wasn’t bothered by this at all, and instead even enjoyed it.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, the receptionist pushed his way through the crowd and reported to Ning Zhuo via voice transmission.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled lightly. Speaking out loud in front of everyone, he said, “It’s just Song Fuli. What do I have to fear? Don’t worry about him, I’ve already made arrangements.”<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo’s absolute confidence, the receptionist could only leave while suppressing his doubts.<br/>
<br/>
The surrounding crowd all looked at each other in horror when they heard Ning Zhuo’s words. However, Ning Zhuo didn’t seem worried and continued toasting.<br/>
<br/>
At first, everyone around him was at a loss and their smiles were stiff. But gradually, they relaxed again.<br/>
<br/>
It had to be said that Ning Zhuo’s calm demeanor even when faced with a major crisis left a deep impression on them.<br/>
<br/>
At the door, Song Fuli had his arms folded, face expressionless. He was like a stone statue giving off an aura that forced people away.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a letter flew over and hovered in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
Scanning the letter with his spiritual sense, Song Fuli found that it was from Ning Jiufan. He knew that this Golden Core stage ancestor of the Ning family was powerful, but before taking action this time, he had already considered Ning Jiufan’s existence.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, he put the letter away and continued blocking the door, obviously not giving in to Ning Jiufan’s demands.<br/>
<br/>
A moment later, another letter arrived in front of him. Surprisingly, it was from Fei Si of the City Lord’s Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
The contents of this letter were almost the same as those of Ning Jiufan’s, asking Song Fuli to stop his actions and not disrupt the peace.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli felt a chill. “The City Lord’s Mansion is actually this supportive of Ning Zhuo?”<br/>
<br/>
A hesitant look appeared on his face as a third letter appeared.<br/>
<br/>
This letter bore the emblem of the Southern Bean royal family. Song Fuli reached out and checked it with his spirit sense; sure enough, it came from Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji’s letter was almost the same as the previous two. It was just that the wording was less harsh.<br/>
<br/>
In the letter, Zhu Xuanji warned Song Fuli not to be impulsive, saying that he should think about the relationship between the Southern Bean Kingdom and Flying Cloud Kingdom before doing anything.<br/>
<br/>
He said that Song Fuli needed to think about the Flying Cloud Kingdom Caravan’s future journeys and had to stay calm.<br/>
<br/>
And crucially, he said that even if the mechanical construct Rudie Niang was in Ning Zhuo’s hands, it didn’t matter. The mechanical construct was Ning Zhuo’s rightful spoils of war!<br/>
<br/>
Such direct and uninhibited words immediately caused an expression of rage to appear on Song Fuli’s face.<br/>
<br/>
However, he quickly suppressed his anger and glanced up at the plague above the door.<br/>
<br/>
This plaque was shiny and new, and as he looked at it, Song Fuli felt that it gave off a completely different aura from before.<br/>
<br/>
The three letters that had arrived one after another were solid evidence that Ning Zhuo’s branch family already had a firm foothold.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from Ning Jiufan of the main Ning family, there was also the City Lord’s Mansion and the Zhu family that ruled the kingdom. How could Song Fuli dare to keep causing trouble?<br/>
<br/>
Even though this Ning branch family was a newly formed faction, it was clearly a local tyrant here in Fire Persimmon City.<br/>
<br/>
If Song Fuli continued to stubbornly remain here, he would be the one who suffered!<br/>
<br/>
The strong dragon can’t suppress the local snake!<br/>
<br/>
Snorting coldly, Song Fuli turned around and left.<br/>
<br/>
The receptionist who had initially welcomed Song Fuli immediately fell down on his butt, back drenched in sweat. Staring at Song Fuli’s departing figure, his face was full of lingering fear as he muttered, “He’s finally gone!”<br/>
<br/>
As for the other receptionist who had just returned after reporting in to Ning Zhuo, he suddenly turned around and looked toward the banquet hall.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes sparkled as he spoke in an excited voice, “The patriarch is so capable! He didn’t even show up in person, but managed to deal with a Golden Core cultivator like Song Fuli! Amazing, too amazing!”<br/>
<br/>
The dust of the Lava Immortal Palace incident had settled, and the beast tide had receded completely. To Fire Persimmon City, the Flying Cloud Kingdom Caravan, with their giant cloud whale floating in the sky, was an eyesore!<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli realized this only after trouble came for him when he blocked the door in front of Ning Zhuo’s branch family.<br/>
<br/>
“Hmph, righteous merely on the surface!”<br/>
<br/>
Quickly heading over to the City Lord’s Mansion, Song Fuli met with Fei Si and directly stated that his caravan would soon move on to its next stop. Although Fei Si showed a look of reluctance, he quickly urged Song Fuli for the exact departure date. Hearing that it would be two days later, the reluctance on his face increased, but he couldn’t hide his slight smile.<br/>
<br/>
No more unwelcome guests came to Ning Zhuo’s branch family, and the banquet ended smoothly. Those who had attended went back and spread news of everything that had happened there and who had come bearing gifts.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, information about the Ning branch family’s establishment ceremony spread throughout the city, causing the new branch family’s reputation to become rock-solid in the hearts and minds of the people.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, Ning Jiufan and Zhu Xuanji were communicating in secret.<br/>
<br/>
“Song Fuli is leaving.” After receiving the latest news, Zhu Xuanji spoke with an indifferent expression.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan sneered. “He’s smart.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly. “He’s a merchant who has traveled all over the kingdom. His power is nothing special, and he only went to block the door because he thought Ning Zhuo was weak and easy to bully. However, as an outsider, he didn’t know what was really going on. It’s not surprising that he chose to back off once he recognized reality.”<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Zhu Xuanji looked at Ning Jiufan and exclaimed in a sincere manner, “Your Ning family has produced a qilin son.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan nodded, stroking his beard and smiling.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was only a low-level cultivator, but by taking advantage of three other parties, he forced a Golden Core cultivator like Song Fuli to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at things this way, it could be said that Ning Zhuo was deft and clever. His ability to handle affairs as the patriarch of a family was certainly not lacking.<br/>
<br/>
In reality, Ning Jiufan had already discovered this talent of Ning Zhuo’s after hearing about the agreement in the Lava Immortal Palace. This incident with Song Fuli merely confirmed it further.<br/>
<br/>
The two people continued their secret talk, eventually reaching an agreement and signing an alliance contract.<br/>
<br/>
After signing the contract, Zhu Xuanji handed Ning Jiufan a jade slip as well as a magical artifact. Ning Jiufan scanned the contents of the jade slip with his spirit sense and nodded in satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
This jade slip contained a beast-controlling technique, and the magical artifact had the power of domination. With the two together, Ning Jiufan would be able to control the Nascent Soul stage demonic ape!<br/>
<br/>
As he watched Ning Jiufan check the jade slip, Zhu Xuanji thought to himself, “The biggest winner of the battle for the Lava Immortal Palace was the Ning family!<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo aside, even Ning Jiufan has obtained ridiculous benefits!<br/>
<br/>
“The Nascent Soul stage demonic ape that he painstakingly rescued will now become a trump card to protect the Ning family once it’s subdued.”<br/>
<br/>
At that time, the Ning Family would be able to compete with the Meng family to a certain extent.<br/>
<br/>
With a Nascent Soul stage monster beast under its control, the Ning family would instantly rise to become the most powerful cultivation family in Fire Persimmon City.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the Ning family had undergone a family split. Over time, as the number of clansmen in the branch and main families continued to increase, their sphere of influence would grow to be the widest in the city.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest military might and the widest influence!<br/>
<br/>
And the Southern Bean royal family was offering its strong support for the Ning family in all this. Naturally, this meant that the game of chess between the royal family and the Meng family of ministers was still ongoing.<br/>
<br/>
If Meng Chong had succeeded, there would have been no problem with Meng Kui becoming the palace master. But the reality was that Meng Kui’s position as palace master had been granted by a cultivator from the Ning family following the royal family’s recruitment order.<br/>
<br/>
“Excellent.” After checking the jade slip, Ning Jiufan revealed a satisfied expression.<br/>
<br/>
“For matters regarding our further cooperation, Brother Ning can contact my uncle, Zhu Hou,” Zhu Xuanji said. Ning Jiufan nodded slightly before leaving. After seeing him off, Zhu Xuanji sighed and turned to the direction of Ning Zhuo’s branch family. Although he didn’t want to get into contact with Ning Zhuo, he had a duty to fulfill.<br/>
<br/>
“I have to go.” Zhu Xuanji had no choice but to bite the bullet and find Ning Zhuo for a secret meeting.<br/>
<br/>
In the patriarch’s study, Ning Zhuo was all smiles, enthusiastically receiving Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
“Master Xuanji, you’re finally here. This junior has spent day and night yearning for you these past few days.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji stretched out his hand and said, “Don’t come over here. Stay away from me. If you have anything to say, just stand over there and talk.”<br/>
<br/>
Then, he continued: “There are two things I have to correct you on.<br/>
<br/>
“First of all, you’re not a junior anymore. You are the patriarch of your branch family. Don’t lose face for your family.<br/>
<br/>
“Second, it’s not me you’ve been yearning for, but the position of an official in my Southern Bean Kingdom, right? But just yesterday, I received a royal decree stating that the kingdom will give you neither compensation nor an official position.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s expression suddenly changed, and he shouted, “This is unfair, the recruitment order clearly states –”<br/>
<br/>
“Enough. Don’t think that the Zhu royal family is easy to bully, Patriarch Ning Zhuo.” Zhu Xuanji interrupted him. “You know very well that you transferred the position of palace master to Meng Kui without first gaining the approval of the royal family. That is against the rules.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately spoke up in retort. “Divine constable, your words are incorrect. You were there at the time. If I didn’t transfer the position to Meng Kui and let him take action as a Nascent Soul stage expert, then would either of us have been able to suppress the whole beast tide?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji replied, “With four divine abilities, I can fight against the Nascent Soul level. Patriarch Ning Zhuo, your true military might isn’t inferior to mine. What is there to fear from a mere Scarlet Flame Beast Tide?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly said, “How could that be possible? My cultivation is so low, how could I compare to you, sir? Sir, please be merciful, don’t baselessly flatter a junior like me.<br/>
<br/>
“At that time, I was only thinking of my family and the lives of the people of this city. That’s why I gave the position of palace master to Lord Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
“Lord Meng Kui is the current city lord of Fire Persimmon City. Isn’t it only natural for him to hold the position of palace master rather than us?”<br/>
<br/>
“Ahahaha.” Zhu Xuanji was so furious he could only laugh. “Ning Zhuo, everything was part of your schemes. The reason you handed over the position of palace master to the Meng family was just to continue playing both sides. You knew that my Zhu family wants to deal with the Meng family, and that your Ning family would become our best partner.<br/>
<br/>
“Well, you’ve succeeded!<br/>
<br/>
“Your family’s Golden Core ancestor has submitted and has secretly been given an official position. He’s also been granted a magical artifact that can subdue that Nascent Soul stage female ape.<br/>
<br/>
“The royal family won’t give you any compensation, but there will be a reward for Mr. Entry Standard.”<br/>
<br/>
When he came to the words “Entry Standard”, Zhu Xuanji couldn’t help but scoff slightly.</div>
