<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Meng Yaoyin's voice came from the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern, but it resonated deep within Ning Zhuo’s divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Successor of the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern, you possess a Million Man Soul and hold power over White Paper Immortal City. You must be the Heaven-ordained variable that Ash Bone Elder foretold!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"You must thwart the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s scheme and return peace to the entirety of the Ghostly Black Marshlands."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">With those words came a massive influx of information, flooding Ning Zhuo’s mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual… the skull of the Heavenly Ghost… postnatal aptitude… choosing White Paper Immortal City as a blood sacrifice… to offer tribute to Yin Heaven…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Moments later, Ning Zhuo fully absorbed the astonishing revelations. His eyes gleamed with sharp light. “So that’s what it is!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In that instant, he grasped the entirety of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s grand plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">And within that same transmission, Meng Yaoyin had also given him a means to fight back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">She clearly stated that she had once descended into the Underworld herself and been received personally by Ash Bone Elder. Under his guidance, she had triggered the mechanisms left behind by the Mystic Ink Scholar, allowing her to use formation techniques to control half of the paper soldier army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">However, how to actually destroy the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s scheme - Meng Yaoyin had not explained. Instead, she expressed complete faith in her successor: since this change was born of the Heaven’s will in the world of the living, then a path to victory must exist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“So that’s what it is.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“So the Heaven-bestowed talisman my boss holds has such a background.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Ash Bone Elder…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo had heard that name once before, from Luo Si’s lips. But now, the meaning behind it felt completely different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“So Mother prepared all this long ago, waiting for the tides of fate to shift. Now that the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is on the verge of success, it may seem like coincidence that I ended up here - but I’m probably the very variable fate had arranged!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“I must give it my all and carry out Mother’s will, to see this through properly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Knowing how important this was, Ning Zhuo immediately used the Life Hanging by a Thread technique to contact Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong, still stationed within the Yin Army formation, was watching White Paper Immortal City repel the ghost tide. Upon hearing the news, he was deeply astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Incredible, Little Zhuo. Your mother’s methods are truly astounding. She actually managed to steal command of half the paper soldier army - this is incredible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo replied, “According to the information Mother left behind, someone has to personally go and activate the formation before that half of the army can be controlled.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“But as for how to use that power to foil the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s plan - Mother didn’t say.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sun Lingtong was unconcerned. “Little Zhuo, your mother isn’t some kind of diviner. The fact that she managed this much is already incredible. And really, she did give you a hint about what to do next, didn’t she?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo knew exactly what Sun Lingtong meant. He nodded. “Right. Since it was Ash Bone Elder who guided my mother back then, and even arranged for the hidden army of White Paper Immortal City to be activated - ”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Then we should find this cultivator and seek his advice.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong added, “Ash Bone Elder might already be waiting for us. He arranged for Luo Si to fish at the banks of the Underworld’s Forgetful River - perhaps that was meant to bring us into contact.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“If that’s the case, then General Luo Si might be Ash Bone Elder’s agent… and possibly even an ally of ours?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo mused aloud, “It’s possible. But we’ll need to meet Ash Bone Elder and get more information before we can be sure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Boss,” Ning Zhuo said with a chuckle, “looks like you’ll have to postpone your Golden Core breakthrough again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong fell silent for a moment, then gave a bitter laugh. “No helping it! Now that we know the truth, I’ll have to double down on my soul cultivation too. I need to push my soul foundation to Million Man Soul - only then will I be qualified to disrupt the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo had already reached the threshold of a million souls. Sun Lingtong now resolved to do the same, to serve as a second line of defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He hesitated. “Should we tell White Paper City Lord about this?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo frowned and considered it. “Mother didn’t mention the city lord in her message. Clearly, she had her reasons.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Whatever her concerns were, she must’ve believed that resolving this crisis doesn’t require the city lord’s involvement.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Hmph!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“My mother gave up her lifespan for the sake of this immortal city. She exhausted herself, even descended into the Underworld, and laid all these plans for the future... She was far too generous and selfless, thinking only of the greater good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“But what did the city lord sacrifice?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“She saw me and immediately called me her savior! It’s obvious she wants to use me - just like she once used my mother.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“But what she doesn’t realize is that while I’m my mother’s son, our temperaments are not the same.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“I’m willing to be a savior. I don’t mind doing a few good deeds. But only if I get something out of it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“I don’t have my mother’s level of selfless enlightenment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Hearing this, Sun Lingtong let out a breath of relief and beamed with praise. “Now that’s more like it, Little Zhuo! We’re not here to be self-sacrificing saints all the time - that’s just boring.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“Your mother played the high game. That’s her business.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo nodded. “Exactly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Even now, the three talisman papers the city lord had forced upon him were still sealed inside his three dantians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He had used the energy of his spirit, qi, and essence to encircle and suppress the talismans, locking them down tight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He was just waiting for the right moment to have Sun Lingtong use his thieving arts to try and extract them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Now would be too soon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The city lord would definitely grow suspicious and reinforce her measures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The ghost tide raged on for three days and three nights before it finally receded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“We made it through another wave,” muttered Tie Guzheng, still holding his post atop the city wall. He had gone without sleep for three straight days, fighting with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But there was no joy of victory in his face - only a grim gaze cast beyond the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">There, a well-disciplined army of underworld troops was slowly retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">They had not taken part in the assault, but instead moved quickly to gather the remaining stray ghosts. In fact, from the start of the battle to their withdrawal, their numbers had grown by twenty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Damn it! We couldn’t break that vanguard force. It’s maddening,” Tie Guzheng snarled, slamming a fist against the battlement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">In stark contrast stood Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“This time, my battle merit definitely qualifies, right?” she exclaimed, practically bouncing with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Qing Yan’s expression soured, but he couldn’t deny the truth. He gave a reluctant nod. “It does. Chi’er, no need to calculate further. You’ve earned it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“But right now, Vigorous Yang Manor is under full lockdown. If you try to visit that brat Jiao Ma, you’ll be blocked at every turn - and you’ll drag him into trouble too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“After all, he’s already the city lord’s favored consort.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Qing Chi’s brows shot up. She glared. “Father, are you trying to go back on your word?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Qing Yan hurriedly waved his hands. “No, no, of course not! I’m just saying - if you want to see Jiao Ma, you need to go about it the right way. I can write him a letter, arrange a private meeting somewhere discreet. That’s much better than trying to sneak into Vigorous Yang Manor, isn’t it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Only then did Qing Chi finally calm down, nodding again and again. “You're right, Dad. I can’t do anything at Vigorous Yang Manor - can’t even speak freely. It’s much easier outside.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Qing Yan nodded in agreement, then his expression suddenly shifted as he raised a hand. “Hold on!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“You can’t do anything in the courtyard - what exactly is it you’re planning to do?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“And outside is easier? Easier for what?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Qing Chi gave a cold snort. “Dad, I’m not a child anymore. Don’t try to control me. I have my own plans.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Qing Yan’s eye twitched in fury. “Don’t you dare do anything reckless! Jiao Ma’s yang essence is still intact - it’s crucial to his cultivation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Hmph. That’s exactly why I held back before,” Qing Chi retorted. “I didn’t want to force things. But now, there’s still time…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Qing Yan was so furious he nearly stomped his foot. “No, absolutely not! You’re a girl - if you’re too forward, he won’t treasure you! Chi’er, you must have patience…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Patience?!” Qing Chi flung out her arm, her voice rising with emotion. “You want me to just sit and watch while Jiao Ma dual cultivates with that old hag, the White Paper City Lord? I won’t allow it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The moment Qing Yan heard her call the White Paper City Lord an “old hag,” his face went pale with shock and fury. He glared and hissed, “Watch your tongue! You really have no filter!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But Qing Chi wasn’t the least bit afraid of her father and opened her mouth to say more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Qing Yan quickly waved his hands to cut her off. “Enough, enough! You thick-headed girl, fine - do whatever you want. Go throw yourself into disaster. Forget about your father, forget about this family!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">That outburst, unexpectedly, softened Qing Chi’s stance. “Dad…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“I’m sorry. Don’t be angry.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“I’m just too anxious to save little Ma.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Qing Yan covered his face with a long sigh, unable to say another word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo had long since returned to Vigorous Yang Manor and resumed his grueling cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">After the army withdrew, Sun Lingtong spoke briefly with the commanding general, stating that he was returning to the Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">With Luo Si’s military order in hand, Sun Lingtong was free to come and go. The commander even pointed out the route back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He dove into the main channel of the Underworld Flood Dragon River, plunging deep until he pierced the boundary between the living world and the dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Though he didn’t know the exact path, he could contact Ning Zhuo at any time - and the latter had full control of the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Following Ning Zhuo’s guidance, Sun Lingtong pressed on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">His destination: the seventh paper soldier legion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This unit was still incomplete, currently in the process of formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">That very incompleteness had allowed the likes of Ash Bone Elder and Meng Yaoyin to interfere, seizing control of the legion for themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">As he traveled, Sun Lingtong retrieved a talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">It was crafted from black jade, three inches and seven-tenths long, glowing with a dim golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The front bore the complete Four-Seal Sigil of Yama at its center, ringed around the edges by illustrations of the Eighteen Hells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The back was inscribed with cinnabar script, containing the Thirteen Chapters of the Underworld Code.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">It was none other than the Heaven-bestowed Talisman!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“So this jade talisman never made it to Ning Zhuo. I’m the one using it in the end,” Sun Lingtong murmured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He continued on, quietly activating the talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">In that instant, a vast surge of soul force poured into his spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The power was immense - and more importantly, utterly pure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Sun Lingtong’s expression shifted at once. He could feel his soul swelling like a balloon, expanding rapidly under the influx.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Unlike Ning Zhuo’s cultivation, which relied on the Four Sacred Treasures, Sun Lingtong’s soul foundation surged directly - swift, steady, and without the slightest instability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">His physical body was far stronger than Ning Zhuo’s as well, more than capable of bearing the rapid expansion of his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">By the time he reached the Seventh Paper Soldier Battalion, Sun Lingtong’s soul foundation had already reached the level of over Two Hundred Thousand Man Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Of course, he hadn’t started from nothing. He was older than Ning Zhuo, so it was only natural that his soul foundation was deeper to begin with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“Little Zhuo, you should’ve used this talisman instead. This is hands-down the most efficient way to cultivate,” Sun Lingtong said sincerely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Once this village passes, there’s no more shop down the road. It’s not every day you get to fleece a husband of the Underworld.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo let out a loud laugh. “Now that sounds familiar. Weren’t you the one I had to convince like this last time?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sun Lingtong replied, “There’s practically no downside. If I had to name one, it’s that you get this constant phantom noise in your ears. You start hearing someone chanting a funeral hymn - really annoying.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up. “What’s in the chant?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“I’ve memorized most of it,” Sun Lingtong said, then began to recite:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“In reverence we offer to the Sovereign of the Lunar Throne, light cast down from the Nine Underworlds. The Yanluo Kings hold the laws, binding souls across the ten directions of the Underworld. Snow surges from the Yellow Springs; spirits cross through myriad tribulations in the vastness beyond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Now, by the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual, we offer devotion to the Underworld Heaven’s Master...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">We present the Sacred Seal of the Four Corners at the Black Altar, arrayed in the true images of the Eighteen Hells as our veil. Black snow cloaks the ground sevenfold, nurturing the Yin Fiend with Yang soul. Cinnabar scripts the Ninefold Transformation of Heaven, invoking the Underworld Law to pierce the void...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">We beseech the Yin Heavens to open a swift path through the Underworld, to cleanse the festering sins of lost souls. Grant us the Celestial Talisman, to anchor the soul’s origin at the Spirit Terrace. May...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">...with humble rites and solemn words, we entreat you to partake!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo’s face lit up with joy. “That must be the Grand Rite Invocation for the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual. Big Brother, memorize the whole thing carefully - there might be a clue in there that could help us crack this entire situation open.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Sun Lingtong shook his head. “Neither of us is a scholar-cultivator. Trying to find a loophole in a ritual text like this? That’s a long shot - don’t get your hopes up.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo said, “When the time’s right, we can show this chant to Wen Ruanyu…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“Let’s set that aside for now. First, we need to get control of this half-formed battalion. Then we head straight for the Water Burial Valley. These paper puppets are enough to prove our identity and earn Ash Bone Elder’s trust.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“And if trouble shows up, we’ve got a small army to throw at it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Sun Lingtong nodded. “Little Zhuo, from here on out, I’ll follow your lead.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo followed the message left by his mother and guided Sun Lingtong to the formation disk hidden deep underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Sun Lingtong poured his spiritual energy into the disk - but nothing happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">After examining it more closely, he figured it out. “This is a Myriad Manifestations Formation Disk. It needs myriad manifestations spiritual energy to activate. What now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo fell into thought. “Looks like Mother intended this opportunity for the Myriad Manifestations Sect to benefit from.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“No problem.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“I remember chatting with Wen Ruanyu - he told me that one of their entry-level spells, the Transmutation Method, can generate Myriad Manifestations energy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">“I’ll message him right now and ask for the technique.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">While Ning Zhuo was busy mobilizing troops in the underworld, Qing Chi arrived at the gates of the Vigorous Yang Manor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">“Please inform Jiao Ma that Qing Chi is here to see him!” Her eyes sparkled, full of anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">“A little girl like you, and your beloved has already become the City Lord’s consort?” A voice suddenly sounded behind her.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
