<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 167: Reclaiming the Black Market</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The first leader of the Crane Beak Gang was a herb gatherer who possessed a family heirloom, the Crane Beak Hoe Magical Artifact, which was highly effective in harvesting wild spiritual plants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The herb gatherers banded together to resist extortion and eventually formed the Crane Beak Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Thus, the foundation of this gang was not particularly strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">During Sun Lingtong's era, the Crane Beak Gang surrendered under pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">When Sun Lingtong was wanted, the Viper Gang rose to prominence and seemed poised to dominate the black market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Crane Beak Gang was the first to offer congratulations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Now, as the leader of the Monkey Head Gang presented the head of the Viper Gang's leader as a greeting gift to the Crane Beak Gang, the leader of the Crane Beak Gang felt no shame or threat, only deep emotion. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Watching him build his grand mansion, watching him host guests, and now watching it all collapse." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Not long ago, the Viper Gang's leader was full of vigor, but now only his head remained, his eyes wide open in death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Viper Gang, which had seemed to dominate the black market, had disintegrated overnight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"The old leader was right!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Those who kill will be killed in return."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Fighting and killing should only be done when absolutely necessary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Our way of life is fine as it is, gathering herbs, selling them for money, and paying some protection fees."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"There is always a higher mountain; there will always be someone stronger than you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Without innate talent, excellent spiritual roots, or a reliable background, to survive in this world, one must become a herb, a spiritual plant. Contribute fruits, show value, rather than flaunt monkey teeth." The leader of the Crane Beak Gang sighed deeply in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He had his own survival strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang warned him that the Monkey Head Gang was intervening in the black market, backed by the Ning family, and hoped the Crane Beak Gang would recognize the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The leader of the Crane Beak Gang said he would convene the elders of the gang to discuss and asked the leader of the Monkey Head Gang to wait a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang waited only for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea before receiving the response from the Crane Beak Gang's leaderâ€”the Crane Beak Gang was willing to submit, but the specific terms needed to be discussed face-to-face with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang was overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The battle to annihilate the Viper Gang had caused significant casualties, and they urgently needed to recuperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Crane Beak Gang's submission was the best outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He laughed, "Smart choice! Come with me, don't keep Young Master Zhuo waiting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Xiangqian stood by the window, staring at the Crane Beak Gang's stronghold, his brows furrowed, constantly monitoring the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang had been inside for some time without any sign, making Ning Xiangqian increasingly anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Why is there still no movement?" He couldn't help but look at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo sat in the main seat, not having stood up since he sat down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Clusters of white floating clouds enveloped him, tightly concealing all fluctuations of his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Such diligence..." Ning Xiangqian thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Before publicly supporting Ning Zhuo at the clan's ancestral hall, he had never interacted closely with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This time, Ning Zhuo invited them to act together, intervening in the black market, marking Ning Xiangqian's first collaboration with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo's various behaviors were truly unexpected for him. "Diligent in cultivation, seizing every moment!" "Very capable, not at all like a recent graduate from the academy." "But still young, a bit impulsive in actions!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Xiangqian believed that Ning Zhuo's order for the leader of the Monkey Head Gang to persuade the Crane Beak Gang was too aggressive and risky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang was crucial in helping Ning Zhuo control the entire Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The battle to annihilate the Viper Gang had shown the Ning family the value of the Monkey Head Gang's leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He commanded well in the battle, effectively mobilizing all the gang members, continuously boosting morale, and maintaining the army's spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This showed that the third leader was well-liked and had sufficient control over the entire Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">No one else could match his influence in the gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"If the leader of the Monkey Head Gang were to die, it would be difficult to control the entire gang, and it might fall apart." This was Ning Xiangqian's greatest concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Footsteps approached, and then the door was knocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Xiangguo's voice came through, "Young Master Zhuo, the leader of the Monkey Head Gang has completed his mission. He has brought the leader of the Crane Beak Gang to see you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Xiangqian was taken aback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He had been watching from the window and hadn't seen anyone leave the stronghold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">It turned out the leader of the Crane Beak Gang had brought the leader of the Monkey Head Gang through an underground passage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Specific terms needed to be discussed and negotiated to be finalized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">According to the terms, the Crane Beak Gang's submission would be determined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The leader of the Crane Beak Gang entered the room and bowed to the floating clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The clouds gradually dispersed, and Ning Zhuo's cold voice came through, "Since you are surrendering, why hesitate to see me?" "Kneel!" Ning Xiangqian immediately shouted coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The leader of the Crane Beak Gang hesitated, feeling the pressure of numerous divine senses locking onto him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The gazes of the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators also rested on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Under the pressure, he gritted his teeth and knelt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The clouds dispersed, and Ning Zhuo saw the leader of the Crane Beak Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">To Ning Zhuo, the latter was an old acquaintance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The leader of the Crane Beak Gang had seen Chui Xu Ke many times but was seeing Ning Zhuo for the "first time." He didn't know that Ning Zhuo was Chui Xu Ke's secret identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Too young!" The leader of the Crane Beak Gang's first impression was this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo was only sixteen years old, really too young.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This youthful face gave the leader of the Crane Beak Gang a surge of courage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He began to propose his own terms, attempting to retain the right to act independently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo sneered, "It seems you haven't recognized the current situation. What you hold are all delusions and fantasies!" The leader of the Crane Beak Gang said, "Lord Ning Zhuo, perhaps I can bring you unexpected help. For instance, you seem to want to unify the black market. You may not yet know that there are three major gangs in the black market. Any individual or force wanting to control the black market cannot bypass these three major gangs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Now, among these three gangs, the Viper Gang has been annihilated by you, my Crane Beak Gang has also submitted to you. The third gang is the most mysterious and has always been little known, but its influence is immense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo chuckled, "You mean the Turtle Breath Gang?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Uh." The leader of the Crane Beak Gang was momentarily stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo looked towards the door, his gaze seemingly able to penetrate through, "By my calculations, he should be arriving soon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The next moment, the Ning family cultivators outside shouted, "Who goes there?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"I am the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang, persuaded by the envoy to come and pledge allegiance to Lord Ning Zhuo." A middle-aged man's voice came through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, "Invite him in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang, dressed in black, walked in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Behind him were two Ning family Foundation Establishment cultivators, their expressions wary, transmitting messages to others, "Be careful! This person's stealth skills are strong; it wasn't until he was within a yard of me that my Magical Artifact's alarm was triggered."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Ning family Foundation Establishment cultivators immediately became solemn, their gazes and divine senses enveloping the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang remained expressionless, feeling a bit disdainful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He had been taught by Sun Lingtong and was very skilled in stealth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He had only revealed his presence voluntarily just now to be discovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">If he had used his full abilities, even standing behind the Ning family cultivators, they wouldn't have noticed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"It's really you!" The leader of the Crane Beak Gang exclaimed, feeling incredulous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">In his knowledge, the Turtle Breath Gang was very mysterious, without a regular stronghold, and its members' identities were often unknown to each other, usually maintaining single-line contact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Even during Sun Lingtong's time, the Turtle Breath Gang remained independent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">When the Viper Gang rose and took over Sun Lingtong's territory, the leader woke up one morning to find a letter from the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang on his bedside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This incident spread quickly, causing the Viper Gang to become much more restrained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"How could such a gang, such a leader, suddenly pledge allegiance to Ning Zhuo?!" The leader of the Crane Beak Gang was very puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"So Ning Zhuo really has a strategy and plan!" "Besides us, this genius youth seems to have another force at his disposal." "Remarkable, his intervention in the black market was not a spur-of-the-moment decision but a well-thought-out move!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">For a moment, the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators frequently cast admiring glances at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Despite having only "Qi Refining Stage Level 3" cultivation, such methods commanded respect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang was awed by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He had heard many rumors about the Turtle Breath Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo had quietly subdued this gang, far exceeding his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"The Turtle Breath Gang has always dealt in intelligence. With such personnel to monitor us, we must be extremely cautious under Ning Zhuo's command!" The leader of the Monkey Head Gang felt even more burdened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He had initially planned to make some small moves, but the Turtle Breath Gang's allegiance made him abandon those thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang took a deep breath and suddenly spoke, loudly congratulating Ning Zhuo for unifying the black market, turning clouds into rain overnight, with astonishing achievements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The leader of the Crane Beak Gang, however, turned pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Turtle Breath Gang's allegiance had thrown him into disarray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo had become overwhelmingly powerful, and his Crane Beak Gang was too weak to negotiate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Unexpectedly, Ning Zhuo shook his head at the leader of the Monkey Head Gang's flattery. "Far from it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"To control the black market, at least three gangs and three wanderers must be mastered."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Now, the Viper Gang has been replaced by the Monkey Head Gang, and the Crane Beak Gang and Turtle Breath Gang have submitted to me. Next, we need to deal with Feng Heizi, the One-Armed Craftsman, and the Unclean."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Hearing this, the Ning family cultivators looked at each other in confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">They were unfamiliar with the black market's inner workings and were hearing these names for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The leader of the Crane Beak Gang turned even paler.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang remained expressionless, but his pupils contracted slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo's deep understanding of the black market surprised them all.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
