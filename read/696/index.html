<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">On the bone altar, Tian Shuang and Di Gui stood in silence for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Di Gui immediately began calculating their losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">They relied on missions issued by the Sect, which already offered substantial rewards. But with the entire team of fellow cultivators wiped out, the bulk of the compensation would have to be sought from the mission's issuer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Five Golden Core cultivators have fallen in battle. Among the two Foundation Establishment cultivators, one even possessed lower-grade celestial aptitude!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This team had been renowned within the Soul Devouring Sect, boasting both seasoned veterans and exceptionally promising young talents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Yet they had been utterly annihilated, with not a single survivor returning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Di Gui's face paled as he tallied the results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Over half of his personal wealth had been lost in this venture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Tian Shuang frowned deeply. "At this rate, we'll likely be unable to take action against the Ning Clan for quite some time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Both were Nascent Soul-level powerhouses with widespread reputations. If they intervened personally, it would undoubtedly provoke the Southern Bean Kingdom and escalate tensions between major powers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts' involvement in the Thousand Peaks Forest conflict had been an exceptional circumstance, not a common occurrence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">That was why they had issued a mission, tasking Golden Core cultivators with harassing the Ning Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This level of conflict wasn't enough to warrant the attention of a cultivation nation. From the nation's perspective, Golden Core cultivators were countless, and only a few exceptional individuals warranted special attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Soul Devouring Sect remained unaware of the secret alliance between the Ning Clan and the Zhu Clan, the royal family of the Southern Bean Kingdom. Had the Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts known this, they would never have allowed this team of cultivators to accept their mission and travel to the Southern Bean Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Where did that little thief Ning Zhuo run off to? Damn it! We can't get a grip on the Ning Clan. What do we do now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Forget about our compensation. Even with ample resources, I doubt any Golden Core cultivators in the sect would dare accept a mission against the Ning Clan anytime soon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">As the Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts struggled with this dilemma, a Nascent Soul cultivator suddenly descended from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Fellow Daoists, the Sect has an urgent mission!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"A mission?" Tian Shuang instinctively shook his head. "We're already occupied with..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The two were the sect's top Nascent Soul cultivators, holding extraordinary status. They didn't accept every mission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Tian Shuang harbored deep hatred for Ning Zhuo. It wasn't just that Ning Zhuo had taken nearly all his wealth; more importantly, he had completely humiliated him. To this day, Di Gui never missed an opportunity to mock him about the incident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The mere thought of it made Tian Shuang seethe with rage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"We must avenge this humiliation!" Tian Shuang seethed, wishing he could stand before Ning Zhuo right now, tear him limb from limb, flay him alive, and torture him a hundred times over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">A dignified Nascent Soul cultivator like himself had been trampled underfoot by a mere Foundation Establishment disciple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Until this humiliation is avenged, my mind will never be at peace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Seeing Tian Shuang's refusal, the Nascent Soul cultivator sighed. "Fellow Daoists, the Sect specifically dispatched me to deliver this message due to exceptional circumstances."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"This mission has been personally assigned to you two by the Sect's leadership."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Tian Shuang snorted coldly. "Which high-ranking official is so callous toward their subordinates? Remember, we have our own backing too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Nascent Soul cultivator revealed a name: "Mr. Yin Yao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Tian Shuang and Di Gui's expressions both shifted slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Mr. Yin Yao was a master of divination, a Spirit Transformation realm cultivator, and the custodian of a Sect-wide treasure that governed the Soul Devouring Sect's fortunes. He rarely spoke, but when he did, his predictions were almost always accurate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Di Gui immediately pressed, "What grave matter could move Mr. Yin Yao to personally intervene?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Nascent Soul cultivator replied, "It concerns the White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The Yin Tide Black Mire Swamp is an ideal blessed land for our Soul Devouring Sect, but unfortunately, it's already occupied."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts nodded slightly. They were well aware of this strategic location and the Sect's long-standing covetousness of it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Nascent Soul sect member continued, "Recently, White Paper Immortal City suffered an unprecedented ghost tide attack, orchestrated by the Forgetful River Underworld."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Our sect discovered this hidden plot and sought to use their own strength against them. We planned to let the Forgetful River Underworld overthrow White Paper Immortal City, then dispatch our elite forces to clean up the aftermath, seizing control of the entire Immortal City and the Yin Tide Black Mire Swamp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"The mission failed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Bone Tomb Daoist, who led the operation, has yet to return."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"He's missing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"But his soul lamp still burns steadily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Nascent Soul sect member paused before continuing, "To uncover the truth behind this incident and retrieve our missing Nascent Soul cultivator, the sect launched a thorough investigation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"The results were disastrous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"The fierce battle only allowed the White Paper City Lord to seize the opportunity to purge his enemies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"The leaders of the former City Overthrow Alliance all lost their lives."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"With no other options, the sect sought the aid of divination experts. Unexpectedly, this matter drew the attention of Mr. Yin Yao, who volunteered to perform a divination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Tian Shuang and Di Gui listened intently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Nascent Soul sect member spoke again, "Mr. Yin Yao's divination revealed that Bone Tomb Daoist has been captured. The sect must pay a substantial ransom for his release."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"This matter is of critical importance to the Soul Devouring Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Mr. Yin Yao has also calculated that the two of you are the most suitable candidates within the entire sect to redeem the captive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Therefore, he hopes you will make the journey and treat the cultivator holding Bone Tomb Daoist with utmost courtesy and respect. Under no circumstances should you act arrogantly or lose your temper."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"If this matter is mishandled, it could jeopardize the sect's overall strategy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Upon hearing this, the Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts understood the gravity of the situation. Their faces grew solemn as they solemnly vowed to follow Mr. Yin Yao's instructions, promising to negotiate with the utmost patience and sincerity to secure Bone Tomb Daoist's release.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Nascent Soul cultivator added, "Remember, your primary objective is to win over the other party, or at least avoid creating further animosity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"You must prioritize the sect's interests above all else. Don't let petty grievances compromise the greater good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Di Gui nodded silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Tian Shuang thumped his chest confidently. "Rest assured, Sect! Who do you think I am? I've handled missions like this countless times. I know what's at stake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"When Di Gui and I represent the sect abroad, we always prioritize the big picture. You can trust us completely!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Tian Shuang's decisive assurance left no room for doubt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Seeing their resolute expressions, the Nascent Soul cultivator finally produced a Jade Slip. "Here are the mission details. Please voice any concerns you may have."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Heaven-Earth Twin Ghosts focused their spiritual senses on the slip, examining its contents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Di Gui raised an eyebrow. "The Flying Cloud Kingdom? Dragon Loach Mountain?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Tian Shuang: "If we're crossing borders, have the Travel Permits been prepared? After all, our reputations precede us - we're both Nascent Soul-level elites."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Di Gui nodded in agreement. "Without Travel Permits, we risk alerting the Flying Cloud Kingdom and provoking a reaction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Nascent Soul cultivator shook his head. "Sirs, you're representing the Sect on a clandestine mission to ransom our people. How could we use Travel Permits? How could you openly cross the border?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Di Gui nodded again. "I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Tian Shuang burst into laughter. "Rest assured, we'll handle this matter flawlessly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Two Note Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">General Mu's Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Mu Lan had been in seclusion for over a month, now at the critical final stage of her cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The female general sat cross-legged, her consciousness plunged into her dantian. Within this inner realm, two legions stood in opposition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Red Blossom Legion, massive and imposing, resembled a colossal Rafflesia flower. On the other side, the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen's Legion was condensed into a stubborn, tightly knit mass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"The moment has come." Mu Lan fully immersed her consciousness within the Red Blossom Legion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">In an instant, she found herself within a city. Ten thousand petals, overlapping like armor plates, formed the Flower Armor City. Stem-like veins, as sharp as halberds, pierced through the four cardinal directions. As Mu Lan ascended the city walls, the pistil at the city's heart unfurled like a crimson-gold military banner, fluttering in the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Elsewhere, representing the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen, was a low-lying riverbank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Behind the embankment, the surging tide roared like an enraged beast. Squads of Blood Armor Crossbow Guards, half-concealed by the waves, their crossbows gleaming like fish scales and bowstrings trembling like rain threads, poised to strike with an aura as solid as iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Without a commanding general, no military banner materialized within the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen's ranks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Mu Lan's expression turned solemn as she slowly raised her hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Within her dantian, the colossal Red Flower Dharma Aspect stirred, rising from the earth to envelop the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">In Mu Lan's mind's eye, the Red Flower City and the riverbank drew impossibly close, and the two forces clashed in a fierce battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The front ranks of the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen knelt, while the rear ranks raised their crossbows. Ten thousand arrows loosed in unison, their mechanical clicks merging into a thunderous roar. Countless bolts transformed into a torrential downpour, their icy tips piercing through flowers and waves, turning the Flower Armor City's walls into a honeycomb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Even though Mu Lan had spent her secluded cultivation period studying the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen in great detail, she was still slightly shaken by the sheer destructive power unleashed by this military formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Behind Mu Lan, the military banner fluttered violently as a brand-new city wall rose into existence. Simultaneously, countless Red Flower Buds sprouted from the blood-soaked embankment, spreading until they completely covered it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Mu Lan personally commanded the Red Flower Dharma Aspect, while the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen remained without a commander. The qualitative difference between the two was stark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Over two hours later, the Red Blossom Legion had completely absorbed the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The fierce battle had served as both a crucible and a forge, refining and merging the two forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The newly formed Red Blossom Legion emerged even stronger. Its previous pale crimson hue deepened into a profound, solemn crimson, as if baptized in blood and fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The tips of each petal sharpened into razor-sharp points, resembling arrowheads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"I've succeeded!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Mu Lan's seated body trembled slightly as she slowly opened her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">In that instant, a fleeting crimson glow, as vivid as blood, flashed deep within her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Mu Lan felt a sudden premonition and instinctively turned her gaze north.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">In her perception, far to the north, she sensed two small pockets of Red Blossom Legion power, extremely faint yet faintly resonating with her own legion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The sensation vanished as quickly as it had appeared, but Mu Lan had already grasped its significance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"This is the power of the Red Flower Dharma Aspect. It must be the two miniature Dharma Manifestations I captured from Lin You and Wu Hen and handed over to Young Master Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Strange, how have they sustained this for so long? Normally, half a month would have exhausted their reserves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Mu Lan immediately realized the answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"That's it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Before entering seclusion to successfully merge with the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen, I used National Power Bricks to strengthen the Red Blossom Legion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"With its foundation enhanced, the Dharma Manifestation's power outside also grew, becoming more enduring."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"I wonder how Young Master Ningzhuo is faring? Is his journey abroad more exciting than his time in Thousand Peaks Forest?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"And... has another woman appeared by his side?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Mu Lan indulged in a moment of reverie before quickly gathering her thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">She was never one for sentimental musings, so she refocused on the matter at hand. "Though the Thousand Peaks Forest campaign ended in defeat, my meritorious service has stabilized the situation at the Grand General's Manor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"The Meritorious Service points I earned weren't substantial. But... Prince Qiming gifted me the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Prince Qiming, a venerable figure of great prestige in the Two Note Kingdom, rarely involved himself in ordinary political affairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">His sudden gift of a military unit to Mu Lan sent shockwaves through the entire Two Note Kingdom's political arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Mu Lan's military achievements had barely stabilized the situation at General Mu's Residence. Prince Qiming's timely assistance, signaling his confidence in the residence, completely transformed Mu Lan's position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Now, no faction, high-ranking official, or even the monarch dared to underestimate General Mu's Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Perplexed by Prince Qiming's actions, Mu Lan immediately voiced her questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Prince Qiming explained that a sudden flash of insight had led him to this conclusion through divination: supporting General Mu's Residence would benefit the Two Note Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">While Prince Qiming lacked formal training in divination or the study of fate, he possessed a unique innate talent called "Blind Light at the End of Night."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Born blind, Prince Qiming lived in perpetual darkness. Yet whenever a sudden light pierced that darkness, he would experience a premonition, sensing a critical choice with profound implications for the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"In any case, for now, this is a good thing for our Grand General's Manor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"As for the price we may have to pay later, we'll deal with that when the time comes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Mu Lan pushed open the stone door of her cultivation chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Red Blossom Legion's foundation had deepened significantly, and they had gained a brand-new unit. She was itching to begin training her troops immediately, eager to forge the Bloodtide Repeating Crossbowmen and bolster the overall strength of the Red Blossom Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The sect was bustling with activity today.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Registration for the Soaring Cloud Assembly had officially begun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo arrived at the nearest registration point, surveying the scene from his cloud-borne vantage point. He saw a queue stretching from the mountain peak all the way down to its base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The registration area at the summit was completely swamped, a sea of heads surging and clamoring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Servant Disciples, Outer Sect Disciples, Inner Sect Disciples - all flaunting their sect status - cut in line, contributing to the chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The only ones actually waiting in line were cultivators from outside the Myriad Phenomena Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo didn't join the queue; instead, he waited patiently for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Brother Ning!" Shen Xi arrived on time, meeting up with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Behind him, as always, was his cousin Su Lingkou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Let's go. I know someone here who can get us registered directly," Shen Xi said. As a member of the Shen Clan from Nine Palaces Immortal City, he had connections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">At the mountain peak, Ning Zhuo nodded and descended with Shen Xi, landing directly at the registration area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Make way!" Shen Xi pushed through the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The cultivator in charge of registration immediately stood up to greet Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Shen Xi's connections were clearly extraordinary. Seeing this, the cultivators who had been grumbling earlier fell silent and tacitly cleared a path for them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Ning Zhuo, Shen Xi, and Su Lingkou approached the registration booth - a simple thatched shed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The cultivator sat back down, retrieved a blank wooden plaque, and explained, "According to Sect Rules, all participants in the Soaring Cloud Assembly must register in person and create their identity plaques on the spot. Please forgive any inconvenience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Shen Xi offered a polite acknowledgment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"Name?" the cultivator asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Instead of answering, Shen Xi gestured to Ning Zhuo, deferring to him to go first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Ning Zhuo," Ning Zhuo replied. As he spoke, he channeled his spiritual energy, writing his name in mid-air with condensed energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The cultivator glanced at the energy-formed name, immediately carved the characters for "Ning Zhuo" onto the wooden plaque, stood up, and presented it to Ning Zhuo with both hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, registration is complete. Please keep this plaque safe."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
