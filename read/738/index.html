<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Damn it, damn it!" Huo Wa'er clenched his fists, extremely unwilling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">His bamboo puppets not only had sound-component parts, but also incorporated his unique mechanical parts, each of which could self-destruct. And the destructive power of the self-destruction was considerable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But now, he had no way to control these bamboo puppets, watching helplessly as they were cut down like vegetables by Ning Zhuo's squad, unable to play any role.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This made Huo Wa'er, who wanted to perform well, feel utterly aggrieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppet squad directly crushed the Fire Bandit's small team and rushed to Zhang Dadan's bamboo puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zhang Dadan knew his disadvantage; unlike other cultivators of the Art of Mechanisms, his spiritual sense was coarse and difficult to control precisely. Thus, he played to his strength and only released three heavy-armored bamboo puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">When unable to be controlled, these three large puppets appeared very clumsy, stopping in place like pillars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">But Zhang Dadan was not too worried: "Even if I can't control them temporarily, with this defense, it's enough for you to hack for a while."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The next moment, Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppet phalanx, like flowing water, bypassed the three large puppets and continued to charge towards the rear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhang Dadan: "Huh..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">His plan fell through? Ning Zhuo had never intended to tangle with them from the start.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo himself had personally experienced two great wars and knew all too well how important it was to seize the military opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"At this moment, I want to inflict maximum damage, not get entangled with clumsy opponents. I must avoid such a waste of time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo's phalanx rushed all the way, taking advantage of the opponents' restraint, causing several times the casualties to the enemy. The scale of the battle results was visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Damn it!" Chen San was the first to regain his ability to move. He gritted his teeth and fully urged his bamboo puppet team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">His situation was somewhat awkward. Before the battle began, he had already maneuvered his small bamboo puppet team to break away from the main force, intending to flank and surround Ning Zhuo's squad from the rear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But unexpectedly, facing such an enemy, Ning Zhuo did not choose to defend solidly, but instead used offense as a defense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppet battle squad was like a fierce tiger descending a mountain. The beast pack under its sharp claws could not last a single round; some were wounded, and some were killed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Chen San could only fully control his squad to rush over from the rear, but he couldn't catch up with Ning Zhuo's squad. He could only watch helplessly as the only enemy army on the field charged deep into his formation like a fierce tiger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Thus, the encirclement lost all meaning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Chen San could only follow the gap Ning Zhuo had created and plunge in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Get out of the way quickly!" Chen San shouted at Zhang Dadan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zhang Dadan replied with a wry smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The next moment, the onlookers witnessed a comical scene - Chen San's bamboo puppet team slammed head-on into the three heavy-armored bamboo puppets. Many bamboo puppets were directly knocked to the ground, lightly damaged, or seriously scattered and dismantled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Does he really practice the Art of Mechanisms with such a control method?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Compared to Ning Zhuo, the gap is too obvious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"He's practically a clown!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The crowd burst into laughter, some unscrupulously giving Chen San sharp ridicule and sarcasm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Chen San's face grew even worse, his eye twitching. He cried out in his heart: "My performance is already very good! You must know, I have never developed anything in the way of sound-based control!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">While Chen San was chasing with all his might, Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppet team's killing momentum was checked for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Jiang Xiaolan was trying her best, blowing the flute until her face was flushed red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The sharp flute sound, even under the cover of Ning Zhuo's zither music, still firmly occupied a place. This led to her insect-bamboo puppets also showing tenacious resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This bizarre squad, composed of beetle shells, arm blades, and poisonous needles, exhibited a stiff, yet fearless and painful tenacity, full of aggression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ting! Sha! (Sound of impact and cutting)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The insect-bamboo puppets fearlessly clashed head-on with Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Arm blades sliced through the surfaces of the puppets, poisonous needles cleverly stabbed at the joints and other weak points of Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppets. Even Ning Zhuo's own movement of playing the ancient zither slowed down a little.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This was not due to external influence, but the young man with the large head, seeing something interesting, had a strong desire to investigate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He subconsciously slowed down his offense, wanting to take a good look at the performance of these insect-bamboo puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">As a result, his opponents all misunderstood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"We still have a chance!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Quickly adjust. Don't waste energy on each other; focus on supporting Jiang Xiaolan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Although Ning Zhuo is strong, this is just a contest of bamboo puppets. If everyone works together, we still have a great chance to win this battle!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This temporary alliance, under Ning Zhuo's immense pressure, adjusted on the fly, establishing primary and secondary roles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">This allowed the sounds they each produced to be quickly re-aligned. Jiang Xiaolan, Chen San, Zhang Dadan, and others became the main force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Jiang Xiaolan had never blown her bamboo flute so fiercely, but after a long attack with no breakthrough, she felt her offensive was like a tide while the opponent was as firm as a rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Chen San! Quickly! Pincer attack!" Seeing Chen San's squad charge behind Ning Zhuo's forces, Jiang Xiaolan's eyes lit up, and she quickly sent a voice message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Chen San heard the urgency in Jiang Xiaolan's voice. His pupils constricted, knowing that Jiang Xiaolan appeared to be on the offensive but was actually exhausted and couldn't sustain it for much longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Ning Zhuo's Art of Mechanisms is truly strong. I admit that none of us is your match."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"But precisely because of this, the current situation has been created."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"The path of cultivation lies in striving! Ning Zhuo, you are a first-rate genius, but I am not. I must seize every opportunity possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"For you, the legacy of Elder Qing Huangzi might be nothing. But for me, it is the greatest opportunity in this life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Chen San roared in his heart, fully exerting himself, controlling all his bamboo puppets to violently crash into the rear of Ning Zhuo's squad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo's squad was in a pincer attack predicament!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Seeing this situation, the observing cultivators inevitably became nervous, as if Ning Zhuo's defeat was imminent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Are they going to succeed?" Old Patchwork Sun nervously clenched his fists. He knew his strength was insufficient, so he simply kept all his puppets in the back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Only by first dealing with Ning Zhuo could he hope to control his puppets and find some slim chance of victory in the subsequent competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo's face was calm. His eyes narrowed slightly, and he felt a little disappointed in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Is that all there is?" After observing for a moment, he couldn't see the insect-bamboo puppets exhibiting any more novelty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">So, the next moment, Ning Zhuo's suspended left hand, whose five fingers had only been plucking one or two strings, suddenly spread open. The five fingers were like the claws of a soaring bird, suddenly bringing a shadow down and enveloping the zither strings!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Zheng zheng zheng zheng...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Although still piercing, this suddenly erupted zither music was distinct in rhythm, solemn, grand, and brought out a strong fighting spirit of clashing metal, iron, and blood!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppets instantly seemed to come alive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">They seemed to truly transform into a hundred-veteran elite army!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Those few openings that seemed to have been "torn open" were instantly sealed! The few insect-bamboo puppets that rushed in were like falling into a whirlpool of a meat grinder, quickly eliminated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The inner circle of bamboo puppets moved with staggered steps and twisted bodies, their arms like spears, accurately stabbing joints!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The outer circle of bamboo puppets rotated like a wheel, raising a whistling wind and violently knocking away the subsequent surging insect puppets!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Some bamboo puppets slyly attacked the lower limbs, while others leaped high, like a fierce tiger pouncing on its prey, savagely attacking and eliminating Chen San's bamboo puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The entire bamboo puppet phalanx transformed into a high-speed, precisely interlocking mechanical millstone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">No matter how tough the insect shells, how cunning and peculiar the poisonous needles and arm blades, no matter the attack from the rear, once they fell into this killing formation driven by rhythm, they were like soybeans thrown into a stone mill, utterly crushed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Jiang Xiaolan and Chen San's eyes widened suddenly, their pupils shrinking, their faces filled with shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The onlookers suddenly let out a collective gasp of surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"This is... a battle formation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Controlled as if by a finger! What kind of control skill is this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Military formation! He actually integrated the way of military formations into puppet control?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">On the stone seat, Elder Qing Huangzi straightened his hunched back, and his cloudy old eyes shot out an unprecedented brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He had been worried for Ning Zhuo just a moment ago, but now he was so excited he nearly stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Ning Zhuo possesses such strength. No wonder he was so confident."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"A genius like this, able to inherit my mentor's legacy, will surely carry it forward. This is truly heaven's blessing upon me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Elder Qing Huangzi was surprised in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He had anticipated Ning Zhuo's skill in mechanism crafting, but he hadn't expected the latter also to practice the military path, and that his military skill was also profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The crowd's gasps subsided, replaced by discussion about Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Ning Zhuo is so young, yet he has such skill. He truly is a genius. He has already left all his opponents far behind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Controlling dozens of bamboo puppets with one person, and being able to execute such a precise battle formation... The top spot in this trial is already settled!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Everyone unanimously believed that Ning Zhuo was bound to be the winner of this Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">At this moment, Ning Zhuo raised his head to look at Elder Qing Huangzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Elder Qing Huangzi's eyes suddenly narrowed, sensing a fervent eagerness to try from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The old cultivator couldn't help but feel a surge of heroism at this moment: "This boy is not satisfied yet, he's looking forward to a higher difficulty? If that's the case, then I'll add fuel to the fire!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He flipped his withered hand, and a jade-black flute appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Elder Qing Huangzi brought the flute to his lips, took a deep breath, and used his spiritual sense and spiritual energy to blow with all his might!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ming -  (A sharp, resounding sound)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The sound suddenly rose, instantly overriding all other sounds. It directly targeted other musical tones, causing strong interference and distortion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Old Patchwork Sun, Jiang Xiaolan, Chen San, Zhang Dadan, and others' faces turned pale, as if struck by a heavy blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The difficulty of controlling the bamboo puppets increased several times. The bamboo puppets in the arena stumbled, some fell directly to the ground, and others spun wildly in place!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo's battle formation, which had been perfectly controlled, was also severely affected. All the bamboo puppets' movements slowed down and became distorted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Elder Qing Huangzi has made a move!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"What kind of sound is that? I feel that even spiritual sense communication is very difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"This must be the true test of this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo's phalanx became chaotic, and the losses became severe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Although his opponents suffered even greater losses than he did, the situation was clearly more disadvantageous for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Because he couldn't afford to trade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He was fighting against multiple opponents, and every bamboo puppet was precious. Conversely, his opponents had abundant soldiers, large teams, and could withstand the attrition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Furthermore, people like Zhang Dadan, who only had three heavy-armored bamboo puppets, were already difficult to control. In this situation, the large bamboo puppets threatened Ning Zhuo's squad, like three heavy hammers trying to crush his phalanx.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The observing cultivators were somewhat dissatisfied when they saw Ning Zhuo being targeted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"What's wrong with Elder Qing Huangzi, is he playing favorites?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"First, the rules allow teaming up, and now there's sound interference. This is a bit too much targeting of Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"This is not fair at all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo's eyebrows furrowed slightly, then smoothed out. His calm expression changed for the first time, adding a hint of fighting spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">In front of everyone, he slowly spoke, his voice not loud, but amplified by spiritual energy, making the message clear: "Only now does it become somewhat interesting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"It's worth using both my hands for."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Chen San, Jiang Xiaolan, and the others' pupils suddenly shrank to the size of needle tips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Old Patchwork Sun's music went completely off-key.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Zhang Dadan's heart also skipped a beat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The observing cultivators then realized: all along, despite the seemingly dangerous situation, Ning Zhuo had only used his right hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Now, his hands floated in the air, and ten fingers rested on the ancient zither.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Na fu fu qian... (Sound of intense zither playing)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo's hands swept and rolled across the zither strings like a violent storm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The ancient zither erupted with an unprecedented sound, sharp, savage, and like a furious roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The sound was tearing, yet penetrating, filled with an extreme fighting spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The zither music directly overwhelmed the entire arena, even stealing the spotlight from Elder Qing Huangzi's flute sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Elder Qing Huangzi's fingers gripping the flute trembled slightly, his eyes filled with disbelief and surprise!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"This child's musical skill is surprisingly solid and profound! How old is he? He is practically my contemporary! If I only use my Foundation Establishment level strength, I would actually be suppressed by him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Accompanied by the zither music that dominated the arena, Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppets were like fierce tigers breaking free from their chains. The formation once again flowed smoothly without obstruction!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Crushing. Complete crushing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Sweeping away all resistance! Truly sweeping away all resistance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">About a dozen breaths later, only Ning Zhuo's bamboo puppets remained on the stone platform. They still maintained a strict formation, standing quietly in position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">All the other bamboo puppets had been reduced to a pile of fragments and broken pieces on the ground!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The dust settled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Only the final, mournful echo of the zither music lingered in the air and in the hearts of the crowd for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">A few breaths later, Elder Qing Huangzi broke the silence and asked Ning Zhuo: "What ancient zither score method are you using?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo bowed with his hands clasped and said loudly: "Elder Qing Huangzi, this is the Dawn Exorcising Devil Score. Its intent is to glorify the righteous path, to eliminate and exorcise devils, using the tearing zither sound to slay all evil. Even if there is darkness, it must be torn and pierced through. If there is a long night, I shall bring the dawn!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The young man in white stood tall and straight, his words resonating clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Good, good, a 'Dawn'." Elder Qing Huangzi finally stood up in excitement. His gaze was burning as he looked at Ning Zhuo, filled with admiration for this successor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"In this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, you are the winner!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"This legacy of my mentor, for you to inherit, is most appropriate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">A smile bloomed on Ning Zhuo's face. He said loudly: "Thank you, Elder!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Old Patchwork Sun, Chen San, Jiang Xiaolan, Zhang Dadan, Huo Wa'er, and the others had ashen faces and no dissent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">The large area of shattered bamboo puppet fragments on the stone platform best reflected the deep sense of powerlessness in their hearts at that moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The crowd of onlookers, who had initially come with curiosity and doubt about Ning Zhuo, having witnessed this trial firsthand, were left only with respect and shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"This... this is simply crushing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Actually, Elder Qing Huangzi already showed so much favoritism, yet he still couldn't suppress Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"There's no point in continuing this Rising Cloud Minor Trial. Ning Zhuo is too outstanding. Elder Qing Huangzi's decision is wise."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
