<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo casually extended his divine sense, covering the two Flying Messages and quickly scanning them to grasp the full context. "This is... interesting," he murmured, a glint of intrigue flashing in his eyes. He studied the messages in his hands, pondering their true value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He had initially believed that his performance with Yu Heye would be enough to convince Shen Xi, Situ Xing, and the others to accept him into their group. Yet now, Situ Xing was once again making things difficult for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">No, he's not trying to make things difficult for me. He's trying to make Shen Xi look bad. Ning Zhuo knew perfectly well that he had never even met Situ Xing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Shen Xi recommended me because he wants to use me to increase his influence within this group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Currently, he only has Su Lingkou by his side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">But Situ Xing is highly wary of Shen Xi. There's an undercurrent of rivalry between them, and I've become a pawn in their game.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Where there are people, there is conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">As an outsider, Ning Zhuo's encounter with such situations was commonplace upon entering this place. Even joining a small faction like this had already drawn him into the conflict, making him a pawn in the clash between Shen Xi and Situ Xing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">It was clear that if Ning Zhuo truly joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect without understanding the power dynamics, he would likely become a frontline pawn in the sect's internal power struggle between the old guard and the rising generation. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">While dealing with small factions like Shen Xi's and Situ Xing's was manageable - their strength ultimately limited to the Foundation Establishment Stage - failing to grasp the sect's larger political landscape and getting caught in the vortex of the sect's internal power struggle would lead to far greater complications.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Boss," Ning Zhuo transmitted through divine sense, using the life-thread connection to contact Sun Lingtong within the Jade Cleansing Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">During Ning Zhuo's brief seclusion to break through his cultivation stage, Sun Lingtong had remained in Meng Yaoyin's former Immortal's Cave, leveraging his Innate Talent to study the Luoshu pages and comprehend formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After hearing Ning Zhuo's concise explanation, Sun Lingtong pondered for a moment before replying, "Little Zhuo, you can handle such trivial matters yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo paused, surprised. "Boss, you trust me that much? Before we left Fire Persimmon Immortal City, we agreed to consult each other on major decisions and keep each other informed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong chuckled. "That was just before we set out, wasn't it? We've traveled through multiple kingdoms, participated in the Ten Thousand Peaks Forest campaign, and even disrupted the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme. You're not the same person you were back then. You can make these decisions yourself now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">A warm current of trust surged through Ning Zhuo's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong grew impatient. "Don't bother me with trivial matters unless it's truly urgent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo severed the connection and reread the Flying Message a second time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The first message was unremarkable, but the second message contained detailed intelligence about Gongsun Yan, including his Innate Talent, appearance, combat habits, and more. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Shen Xi also speculated that because Gongsun Yan was Lin Jinglong's most trusted subordinate, Ning Zhuo would likely face him as an enemy in the future. Knowing one's enemy is half the battle won, so gathering this intelligence in advance could only be beneficial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Had it been anyone else, they might have been secretly moved by Shen Xi's warmhearted gesture. But Ning Zhuo knew better: he and Shen Xi were now on the same side, and Shen Xi helping Ning Zhuo was simply helping himself. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo rubbed the Mechanism Ring on his finger, thoughts swirling through his mind before dissolving like mist. There were countless ways to handle this situation. But just as he had done with Yu Heye, he needed to carefully assess the situation and calibrate his actions. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Too little force would elicit no response, while too much would turn an ally into an enemy - an outcome worse than the original problem. What was the right approach?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Inside the Immortal's Cave, Gongsun Yan sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, his gaze fixed on a piece of wood in his hand. The charred log was about three feet long and as thick as a child's arm. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Though blackened by lightning, it wasn't lifeless. Upon closer inspection, jade-like azure light shimmered through the cracks in the charred surface, its delicate strands weaving through the fissures. As the azure light flowed, faint traces of Thunder Marks flickered intermittently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Gongsun Yan held the wood, feeling its gentle warmth radiating outward. This was the precious Thunderstruck Wood Springbirth he had obtained in exchange for agreeing to fight alongside Lin Jinglong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The story began with the Lin Clan's core cultivation art, the Myriad Wood Springthunder Guidance. This technique allowed cultivators to extract the essence of myriad woods, refine it into Yi Art spiritual energy, and transform it into Spring Thunder. Its core principle was: "Thunder and rain, life and destruction, shine in equal glory." Wood-type spiritual energy was traditionally associated with growth and endurance, but Yi Wood Spring Thunder could both harm enemies and create life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">All cultivators who practiced the Myriad Wood Springthunder Guidance possessed the ability to mass-produce Thunderstruck Wood Springbirth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Gongsun Yan was no stranger to this precious material. He skillfully crushed Spirit Stones to enhance the Qi density within the Immortal's Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Immersed in this concentrated Qi, a thin layer of azure mist gradually formed on the surface of the Thunderstruck Wood Springbirth. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Gongsun Yan took a deep breath, savoring the refreshing air that felt like being in a forest after a rain. He could now more deeply sense the nascent vitality of early spring vegetation contained within the Thunderstruck Wood Springbirth, as well as the thunder's unique purifying power that cleansed all things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The distracting thoughts and restlessness that had plagued his Divine Sea Dantian gradually dissipated under this aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This was precisely why Gongsun Yan needed this type of wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">His Heart-Melting Innate Talent was only low-grade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This level of talent had both advantages and significant drawbacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Heart-Melting could generate Heartfire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Heartfire could be considered a proto-Fire Seed, capable of combining with any Fire-type cultivation technique in the world to form a corresponding Fire Seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The advantage of Heartfire lay in its complete controllability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Cultivators didn't need advanced Fire Element cultivation realms or mastery of Fire-type cultivation techniques to naturally possess complete control over Heartfire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">They could make the most minute adjustments, ensuring that every fraction of Heartfire's heat remained under their command.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Such Heartfire was naturally suited for Alchemy and Artifact Refinement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Because of this Innate Talent, Gongsun Yan had chosen Artifact Refinement among the hundred arts of Cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">And because of this Innate Talent, he had chosen to align himself with the Lin Clan - he needed Thunderstruck Wood - Spring Thunder to alleviate the drawbacks of Heartfire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The more frequently and for longer durations Heartfire is used, the more it disrupts the balance of the Five Elements within the body, leading to physiological imbalances and various ailments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">This is why Gongsun Yan's appearance was inhuman, with bronze skin and dark golden bones - these were unavoidable transformations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">This physiological imbalance not only affects the cultivator's physical body but also their mental state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Prolonged use of Heartfire can make one irritable, violent, reckless, impatient, and prone to losing composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This was particularly dangerous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Even the most basic cultivation practices carried the risk of qi deviation if one's mental state was unstable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Moreover, tasks like Artifact Refinement require persistence and patience; rushing the process inevitably leads to failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">It was precisely because of this negative impact on a cultivator's mental state that Gongsun Yan abandoned Alchemy and chose Artifact Refinement when carefully selecting his cultivation path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Alchemy demands far more precise control compared to Artifact Refinement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Artifact Refinement, by contrast, is more forgiving, allowing for a greater margin of error.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Gongsun Yan feared that his unstable mental state would lead to Alchemy failures, leaving him with nothing to show for his efforts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The consequences of alchemy failure are often far more severe than those of artifact refinement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">When precious medicinal materials are mixed together, their medicinal properties permeate each other. A failed alchemy attempt typically results in complete waste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Artifact refinement, however, is different. Even in failure, some costs can often be recovered from the scrap materials, mitigating losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">These losses were not to be underestimated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A cultivator's lifespan is far from short, and they will attempt artifact refinement and alchemy countless times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The cumulative losses from each failure, over a lifetime, can amount to a staggering sum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">This massive loss often represents the pinnacle of a cultivator's cultivation progress and their overall achievements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Gongsun Yan held his breath, focused his mind, and slowly activated his Innate Talent, unleashing his Heartfire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Heartfire surged into the Thunderstruck Wood - Spring Thunder before him, igniting it instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The charred exterior of the Thunderstruck Wood crackled softly as the precious material burned, dyeing the crimson Heartfire a deep, cyan-black.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Gongsun Yan carefully began to retract the Heartfire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Of course, he only retrieved a small portion of it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The cyan-black Heartfire merged into his body, carrying the life-and-death power of Spring Thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Heartfire coursed through his body, leaving countless fine, shimmering burn marks that glowed with a verdant, azure light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">These wounds, nourished by the life-giving energy of Spring Thunder, healed rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Continuing from earlier, the necrotic tissue was instantly dissolved and reshaped by the life-infused thunderous power, as if undergoing a baptism of thunder from within and a sprouting of vegetation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Each cycle of destruction and rebirth brought Gongsun Yan excruciating pain throughout his body and mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Yet as he healed, a profound sense of liberation and renewal welled up from the depths of his being, akin to shedding his old skin and emerging anew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The dark azure Heartfire reached his Divine Sea Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Massive amounts of distracting thoughts, anxieties, and impatience were purged by the might of Spring Thunder, as if washed clean by a torrential spring rain, leaving no trace behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Gongsun Yan felt increasingly lighter, his mind gradually approaching the serene state of "empty mountains after rain, a clear mirror reflecting still water" - a state of perfect clarity and emptiness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But just then, a giggle suddenly echoed from behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Hee hee hee."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Gongsun Yan's eyes snapped open, his pupils contracting to pinpricks!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Every hair on Gongsun Yan's body stood on end. He absolutely hadn't expected anyone to infiltrate his Immortal's Cave, sneak up behind him, and remain completely undetected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">A surge of intense danger compelled Gongsun Yan to activate his defensive measures without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Simultaneously, he whirled around, intending to confront his attacker head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">But before he could complete his turn, darkness engulfed his vision, and he collapsed into unconsciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Sun Lingtong whistled softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Gongsun Yan's cultivation level was modest, merely at the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong could handle Golden Core cultivators with ease, let alone opponents of the same level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">At Ning Zhuo's request, he had effortlessly knocked Gongsun Yan unconscious in moments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Slap! Slap! Slap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">A series of sharp slaps landed on Gongsun Yan's face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The latter's eyes fluttered open, his mind still hazy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">But in the next instant, Gongsun Yan's memories flooded back. His body jolted as if struck by lightning, and he would have leaped to his feet had he not been tightly bound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Who are you?!" he demanded, glaring at Ning Zhuo with fury and alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Stay still. Don't move," Sun Lingtong said, standing behind him. His small hand rested on Gongsun Yan's shoulder, instantly immobilizing him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Within a few breaths, cold sweat beaded on Gongsun Yan's forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He scrutinized Ning Zhuo, noting his white robes and youthful, sunny demeanor. The only oddity was his slightly large head, but overall, he exuded an aura of warmth and approachability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Gongsun Yan remained unmoved by this seemingly amiable demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">What a joke!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Would someone truly kind and approachable sneak into another's Immortal's Cave and ambush fellow cultivators?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo smiled at Gongsun Yan. "Don't be afraid. I'm here to heal you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">His smile and words only deepened Gongsun Yan's terror. Could this young cultivator be suffering from some mental disorder?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Or perhaps he's a twisted Demonic Cultivator who delights in torturing others?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Despite Gongsun Yan's imposing physique and inhuman appearance, he actually had limited combat experience, focusing primarily on Artifact Refinement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">His cultivation resources were typically obtained through bartering the fruits of his refinement efforts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The Lin Clan had dispatched him to assist Lin Jinglong, his role being technical support rather than direct combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Nevertheless, due to his innate talent and superior equipment, Gongsun Yan's combat prowess remained among the top tier within Lin Jinglong's subordinates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo, aware that words would be futile, reached out and seized Gongsun Yan's head as if grasping a ball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Damn it! This Demonic Cultivator is going to search my soul!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Gongsun Yan's heart leaped into his throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">But Ning Zhuo merely channeled his spiritual energy and divine sense to inspect Gongsun Yan's internal condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Gongsun Yan was utterly powerless to resist as Ning Zhuo's divine sense swept through his body, laying bare his inner workings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"You're indeed gravely ill," Ning Zhuo said with a gentle smile. "Don't be afraid. I can heal you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">He then retrieved his Innate Mechanism Fan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Gongsun Yan's eyes widened, and he instinctively recoiled, trying to distance himself from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Wait, wait!" Gongsun Yan threatened. "Do you know I've already joined the Lin Clan? If you attack me, you'll have to answer to Young Master Lin Jinglong and the Mo Gaofeng Lin Clan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo ignored him, simply fanning the Five Elements Mechanism Fan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">His Innate Spell, the Five Elements Creation-Destruction Art, unleashed its full power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Five Elements within Gongsun Yan's body were severely imbalanced, causing his various ailments. Under the influence of the Five Elements Creation-Destruction Art, his condition underwent a complete transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Gongsun Yan's body shuddered, his eyes widening in initial confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">But the physical changes were undeniable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">It was as if a parched desert had suddenly been drenched by a torrential downpour.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">In this rain, the Fire Element rapidly receded, the Water Element irrigated, the Earth Element nourished, the Wood Element surged upward, and the Metal Element flourished, ultimately restoring balance to the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">His bronze skin visibly paled, and the dark golden luster of his bones faded to a normal sheen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The power of Spring Thunder was one of destruction followed by rebirth - it was healing him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo's Five Elements Fan, however, fundamentally reconstructed the balance of the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The former treated the symptoms without addressing the root cause, while the latter directly resolved the fundamental problem!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">These were solutions operating on entirely different levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Gongsun Yan stared at Ning Zhuo in disbelief. "H-how did you do that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">How could he have restored the balance of the Five Elements within his body in an instant?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Gongsun Yan had been plagued by this imbalance for years, having tried countless methods to resolve it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">In the end, he reluctantly chose to join the Lin Clan precisely because the treatment plan to restore the balance of the Five Elements was too difficult to implement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo smiled. "It's simple. I just need to fan you." "You're lucky I happen to have a Five Elements Fan." Gongsun Yan's gaze immediately grew fervent, his eyes fixated on Ning Zhuo's Lifebound Treasure, momentarily entranced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo continued, "My name is Ning Zhuo. I believe Fellow Daoist Gongsun Yan has heard of me." Gongsun Yan remained dazed for a moment before snapping back to reality. "Ning Zhuo? You're Ning Zhuo?!" His fear subsided, replaced by accusation. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Do you realize you're violating sect rules by treating me like this?!" "We agreed to resolve our conflict in the Martial Arts Hall," Ning Zhuo countered. "Yet you secretly infiltrated my Immortal's Cave and attacked me..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo interrupted, "No, I came to heal you." Gongsun Yan sneered. "Sophistry..." Ning Zhuo spread his hands, cutting him off again. "Just tell me - was the treatment effective or not?" Gongsun Yan's expression froze, then he gritted his teeth. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"You think I'd be cured so easily? My physical ailments might be resolved, but how do you quell the lingering heat, rage, and chaotic thoughts in my divine sea? I still need Thunderstruck Wood!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Clearly prepared, Ning Zhuo waved his fan without hesitation. This time, the wind directly targeted Gongsun Yan's Upper Dantian, completely suppressing and sweeping away all traces of heat, rage, and chaotic thoughts within his divine sea. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo smiled. "How do you feel now?" Gongsun Yan's jaw dropped, his entire being frozen in shock as he stared blankly at Ning Zhuo and the Mechanism Fan in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
