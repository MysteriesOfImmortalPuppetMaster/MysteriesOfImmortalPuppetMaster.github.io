<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 252: Secret Meeting at the Medical Pavilion</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">A small skirmish concluded, and the mechanical constructs surged forward, tearing apart the intruding demon beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A teleportation circle appeared, swallowing the corpses of the beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The mechanical constructs, lined up like a long queue, gradually retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo stood at the side of the retreating line, waiting for them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He spotted a mechanical construct missing an arm and a leg, its eyes suddenly brightening as it neared the line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He pulled it out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Having received a task, the mechanical construct did not resist and allowed Ning Zhuo to manipulate it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo had the construct lie down by the street, squatted down, and immediately opened it up, dismantling various mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo discarded the damaged components, retrieved materials from his own storage pouch, and crafted several mechanical parts on the spot to replace the damaged ones on the construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">His movements were efficient and swift, especially the dexterity of his fingers, which dazzled the onlookers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After just over twenty breaths, the mechanical construct was restored to its original state and rejoined the queue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo crossed his arms and continued to scrutinize the remaining constructs in the line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">There were many damaged constructs, but Ning Zhuo overlooked most of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Not every mechanical construct was chosen for repair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Some required intricate repairs involving formation patterns, which would consume a significant amount of Ning Zhuo's time and energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Others appeared severely damaged but could be fixed quickly by swapping out some components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo primarily selected the latter type of construct because they were quick to repair and offered considerable merit points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Notably, Ning Zhuo used his own materials to craft replacement parts for these constructs, as he discovered that doing so earned him more merit points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">His actions effectively saved resources for the Lava Immortal Palace, much like Zhu Xuanji, who once donated three quasi-Golden Core level mechanical constructs to the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">However, Ning Zhuo's method was far more profitable than directly donating materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He earned significantly more merit points this way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"In just three days, Ning Zhuo has already grasped the essence," Zhu Xuanji, who constantly monitored Ning Zhuo, marveled at his actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zhu Xuanji recorded this observation in a jade slip, which was soon delivered to Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After browsing the contents of the jade slip, Ning Xiaohui's face clouded over. "Ning Zhuo has already found the trick!" she fumed. "Damn it, it took me over ten days to figure it out. How long has he been here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The shadow of past memories resurfaced, making Ning Xiaohui feel uneasy. "Why choose the Medical Pavilion to compete? Ning Zhuo, you're clearly targeting me, trying to entangle with me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"I've already been forced to leave, yet even in the Immortal Palace, you won't let me go," Ning Xiaohui gritted her teeth, feeling intensely targeted by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">She pondered the situation: "To obtain the most basic physician position, it requires consuming ninety-six merit points. At Ning Zhuo's repair speed, considering the time he's been here, he's probably close to meeting the requirement. Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Different positions can be transferred, but my upward application hasn't been approved! That's because I'm currently the only one in the Medical Pavilion, and my position is the highest!" "No, if this continues, I'll really be caught up. I need to be faster, I need more merit points!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Xiaohui felt as if a prehistoric beast was chasing her, an immense pressure enveloping her heart, forcing her to strive for more merit points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zhu Xuanji easily achieved his goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He needed Ning Xiaohui to secure a position at the Historical Records Pavilion as quickly as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Once he obtained the intelligence from the pavilion, he could identify all the true culprits and criminals, whether they were involved in bombing the Immortal Palace or Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After another successful repair, Ning Zhuo gently lifted the mechanical construct, setting it upright. "Go," he said, giving it a light push on the back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The construct quickly caught up with the retreating line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo returned to the main group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The cultivators gathered together, primarily from the Ning family, with a few from the Zhou and Zheng families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo was a prominent figure, attracting attention with every move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">His frequent repairs of mechanical constructs recently inspired many to follow suit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">As a result, everyone discovered that repairing these constructs indeed earned substantial merit points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">When Ning Zhuo returned, they were discussing their respective merit points. "I have thirty-nine merit points." "I have forty-six merit points." Zhou Zeshen softly said, "Fifty-two." Then he glanced at Ning Zhuo, asking, "Brother Ning, at your speed and with the time you have, your merit points must have reached eighty or ninety, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo silently checked his merit points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Negative one hundred ninety-three! He wept inwardly but maintained a slight smile outwardly, nodding to everyone, "I've already surpassed ninety-six." "Now I can enter the Medical Pavilion and take on the lowest position thereâ€”a physician."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Everyone was amazed and congratulated him. "As expected of you," Zhou Zeshen smiled and nodded, not surprised at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo's recent display of mechanical prowess had earned his admiration. "Let's go, let's head to the Medical Pavilion together." "We want to witness Brother Ning's moment of entering the pavilion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Everyone surrounded Ning Zhuo, sincerely congratulating him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo shook his head, "There's nothing to celebrate. You'll all be there soon, and once everyone takes on the physician position, you'll earn merit points even faster." "I'm exhausted and not in a hurry to start. Let's return to the courtyard first, and I'll share more repair experiences with everyone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo's proposal was immediately met with widespread approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This wasn't the first time he had done this! Over the past few days, after returning to the temporary base, he would openly share his repair experiences in the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">His understanding of various mechanical components was directly imparted to others, significantly improving everyone's skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Many cultivators from the Zhou and Zheng families also came to listen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Chen asked Ning Zhuo if they should be allowed to join.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo replied, "At this moment, the Four-Sided Alliance is the big picture. We shouldn't be petty; let them all come and listen." Such magnanimity earned Ning Chen and others' admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">However, some members of the Ning family felt discontent, believing it unfair for the Zhou and Zheng families to receive the same treatment as them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo anticipated this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">After each session, before going to sleep, he would gather the Ning family cultivators in his room to share deeper insights and many tips on repairing and selecting mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This approach dispelled any lingering dissatisfaction among the Ning family cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After finishing his nightly session, Ning Zhuo headed to the Medical Pavilion alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">By the time he arrived, it was already late at night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">However, the Lava Immortal Palace remained brightly lit, with ample illumination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Here, day and night were indistinguishable, and without using spells to measure time, one could easily lose track of it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Whether it was the magma, the pale golden spherical barrier, or the beast tide outside the barrier, the Lava Immortal Palace's night was filled with noise and heat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After entering the Medical Pavilion, Ning Zhuo emulated Ning Xiaohui's initial actions, exploring and continuously taking on repair tasks at the workbench, repairing over a dozen mechanical constructs in succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After completing these tasks, he returned to the base with dark circles under his eyes, bearing a weary yet excited expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The next day, after only two hours of sleep, Ning Zhuo once again headed to the Medical Pavilion alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">His actions differed from others, and each return was met with numerous inquiries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo continued to share his experiences with everyone and, during this process, informed them of the Medical Pavilion's inner workings, inspiring them and increasing their motivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Seizing this opportunity, Ning Zhuo also mixed information about the critical care unit with other intelligence, sharing it with everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After two days of such behavior, Zhu Xuanji and others gradually became familiar with his movements and began to reduce their attention on him. "The time is ripe," Ning Zhuo thought as he entered the critical care unit of the Medical Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Upon arrival, he closed the door and activated the room's formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Instantly, his connection with the outside world was severed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Golden Core cultivators, sensing this, immediately communicated through voice transmission. "What's happening with Ning Zhuo? I've lost contact with him." "I can't sense him either." "Stay calm; it might be a special arrangement of the Medical Pavilion. I recall, did he enter the critical care unit?" "Let's wait and see. Honestly, we can only wait. We're not trial disciples and can't get close to the Medical Pavilion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Golden Core cultivators temporarily settled down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Inside the critical care unit, Ning Zhuo met Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu. "Senior Yang," he greeted Yang Chanyu with a cupped fist, then turned to Sun Lingtong, "Brother Sun, we meet again." Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong acted distant, a precaution against Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Sun Lingtong explained to Yang Chanyu, "I've collaborated with Brother Ning Zhuo multiple times. The grand plan I mentioned to you earlier was also conspired with Brother Ning Zhuo." "Brother Ning Zhuo is a member of the reformation team and has gained Zhu Xuanji's trust. To obtain firsthand intelligence, we must rely on him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Moreover, as a trial disciple of the Lava Immortal Palace, his status allows him access to important buildings like the Medical Pavilion, which will greatly aid our upcoming actions." Yang Chanyu nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The facts were evident, and she acknowledged Sun Lingtong's words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Of course, as she interacted with Ning Zhuo, she would gradually discover the differences between him and other reformation team members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">For instance, even if other team members joined the Medical Pavilion and took on the physician role, they wouldn't have such significant authority to allow outsiders into the critical care unit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"You, a mere Qi Refining Stage, dare to covet the Lava Immortal Palace with a Foundation Establishment cultivator? Quite bold!" Yang Chanyu remarked, scrutinizing Ning Zhuo closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">From her perspective, this was her first face-to-face meeting with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">She had to admit, Ning Zhuo had a good appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Dressed in white, with clear eyes, at sixteen, he was in the prime of youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Additionally, Yang Chanyu felt an inexplicable affinity with Ning Zhuo's life aura.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
