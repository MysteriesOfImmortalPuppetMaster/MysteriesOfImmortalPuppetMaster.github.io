<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Cultivator Hao didn't immediately agree. Instead, he observed the situation first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ao Pan, hunched over like an old ape, moved forward at a leisurely pace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Despite his relaxed demeanor, he maintained his first-place lead, having already acquired five Bronze Artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">However, his favored Bronze Whip had become too worn to use, forcing him to rely primarily on a Bronze Staff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ao Pan's martial arts foundation was exceptionally solid, allowing him to wield all eighteen types of weapons with proficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In second place was Tie Zheng, a Golden Core-level Martial Cultivator, currently claiming his fifth Bronze Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Surrounding him were four weapons: a Bronze Saber, Sword, Spear, and Scythe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">These weapons moved in perfect coordination, advancing and retreating with ease, occasionally executing combination attacks or synchronized maneuvers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Wearing a Bronze Beast Mask, Tie Zheng's mastery of divine sense control rivaled that of Mechanism Cultivators at the same cultivation level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Lu Zeng held third place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Wielding a Bronze Spear, he had just begun his battle for a fifth Bronze Saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He rotated through his four weapons, including a Bronze Hammer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Bronze Saber's swordsmanship had reached the realm of "no technique is the best technique." Its seemingly ordinary strikes suddenly exposed Lu Zeng's weakness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">With a sigh, Lu Zeng released his Bronze Spear, rolled aside to evade the blade, and then clenched his hands into empty fists, slamming them toward the Bronze Saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In an instant, the Bronze Hammer, which had been hovering beside him, flew into his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He missed his strike, but the force of the blow forced the Bronze Blade back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Cultivator Hao, observing the scene, found it intriguing. "Tie Zheng, a Golden Core-level Martial Cultivator, wields the Profound Armament Armor like a Mechanical Cultivator. Conversely, Lu Zeng, a Mechanical Cultivator, fights with the ferocity of a Martial Cultivator in close combat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Their roles seem mismatched, but in truth, both are consciously training themselves, honing their weaknesses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"They're both preparing for the third trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The top three positions were dominated by Golden Core-level cultivators, underscoring the paramount importance of cultivation realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Achieving the Golden Core realm represents a qualitative transformation, granting cultivators comprehensive enhancements in all aspects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The fourth position was claimed by a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zhang Wangxing smiled confidently, his eyes gleaming with anticipation. "Come, let's see what the fourth Bronze Artifact is?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Relying on the Flesh Transformation Sutra, Zhang Wangxing bypassed conventional combat. Instead, he exploited his bizarrely adaptable physical body to directly restrain the Bronze Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">This tactic perfectly countered the Profound Armament Armor's strengths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After all, the early iterations of the Profound Armament Armor primarily relied on close-quarters combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Only from the sixth artifact onward would the armor begin employing spell-like offensive techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Zhang Wangxing capitalized on his strengths, securing three consecutive victories through cunning tactics, which greatly boosted his confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"I can handle the first five Profound Armament Armor pieces. The real challenge lies in the sixth one!" he declared confidently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Zhang Wangxing was well-informed about the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">His strategy was to quickly refine the first five pieces, drastically boosting his strength, and then focus all his efforts on battling the sixth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">So far, everything had unfolded exactly as he had planned since entering the Rising Cloud Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Now, he faced the fourth piece:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">A massive bronze mace, studded with wolf's teeth, loomed before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"That's... awfully large..." Zhang Wangxing's eye twitched, a hint of unease crossing his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sensing his presence, the bronze mace slowly advanced, its weight pressing down on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zhang Wangxing gritted his teeth, straightened his posture, and bared his chest. "Come on! Hit me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In the next instant, the bronze mace slammed into him with tremendous force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Blood splattered everywhere as flesh and muscle deformed like mud, rapidly surging upward in a desperate attempt to engulf the weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">With a violent jerk, the mace withdrew, dragging countless fragments of mangled flesh with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The searing pain contorted Zhang Wangxing's face into a grimace, sweat pouring down his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Forcing himself to endure, he spread his arms wide and threw himself onto the mace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Become one with me!" he roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The mace resisted fiercely, thrashing and smashing against him, inflicting a relentless barrage of devastating blows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"I..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"You..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"So... even the wolf-tooth mace can suppress me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhang Wangxing writhed in agony, hissing as he gasped for air, but he forced himself to endure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Below Zhang Wangxing, in fifth place, was not Ban Ji, but the Rust Disaster Artisan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He was surrounded by bronze swords, blades, and other weapons, each piece of Profound Armament Armor showing signs of corrosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Cultivator Hao frowned unconsciously as he observed the Rust Disaster Artisan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He loathed the man to his core. In truth, this wasn't just his personal bias; nearly all the cultivators of Profound Armor Cave despised the Rust Disaster Artisan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"This man possesses low-grade Innate Talent, allowing him to corrode objects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"The cave's Formation cannot suppress the full expression of Innate Talent, granting him a shortcut - by corroding Bronze Artifacts, he greatly reduced the difficulty of subduing them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Hence, his high ranking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's Rising Cloud Trial was designed to promote the Profound Armament Armor, encourage wider adoption, and forge closer ties between genius cultivators and Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">But the Rust Disaster Artisan's corrosion of the Profound Armament Armor directly undermined the cave's purpose. This was why the crowd harbored a deep-seated resentment toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Finally, it was Ban Ji's turn in sixth place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Cultivator Hao watched Ban Ji, armed with a mace, chain hammer, and occasional throwing knives, battling against a pair of nunchaku.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">After a few glances, he chuckled softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Ban Ji's movements with these weapons clearly mimic sword and saber techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Now I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Why I was instructed to secretly arrange for him to receive bronze swords and sabers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Cultivator Hao glanced back, a peculiar expression crossing his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He noticed that the top five cultivators all wielded swords or sabers, yet Ban Ji hadn't received a single one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"These bronze artifacts are randomly assigned by the Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Swords and sabers are the most common, so there should be plenty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Ban Ji has diligently trained in sword and saber techniques, yet he hasn't encountered a single one. Worse still, none of the bronze artifacts he's obtained are even remotely suitable for mimicking those techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Even a bronze axe or hammer would have allowed him to adapt his sword and saber skills. But he hasn't gotten any of those either. How could his luck be this bad?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Cultivator Hao continued observing the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">As he watched Ban Ji wield throwing knives, the chain hammer, and the mace against the nunchaku, the peculiar expression on his face deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Let's see what his fifth bronze artifact will be."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Cultivator Hao activated his authority to secretly check the upcoming selection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Uh... it's a shield."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">And still no sword or blade!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"What kind of heaven-defying, wrath-inducing thing did this kid do?" Cultivator Hao felt a pang of sympathy for Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ban Ji activated his weapon, yet his movements were clearly sword and blade techniques. This incongruous fighting style made him look utterly out of place, each strike seeming to cry out, "I want a sword! I want a blade!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ban Ji had practiced other weapons, but the problem was that he had devoted nearly all his martial arts training time to swords and blades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">In the heat of battle, he didn't have time to think. His body instinctively executed sword and blade techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">It couldn't be helped - he was just too well-trained in those methods!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Cultivator Hao mused, "Still, Ban Ji only needs to wait a while to enter the third trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"In the third trial, he'll at least obtain a blank Profound Armament Armor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Since he primarily cultivates his Upper Dantian, his divine sense is abundant. With his foundation, he has a high chance of acquiring two armors. This means he'll eventually get his sword and blade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"The Ban Clan wants me to secretly assist him, likely to ensure he performs well in the second trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"The more Bronze Artifacts he obtains in the second trial, the better his final performance in the third trial will likely be."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Only by collecting nine pieces can one qualify for the top spot in the Profound Armor Cave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I see. The Ban Clan wants Ban Ji to secure first place, helping him catch up to the first wave of geniuses and join their ranks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Thinking of geniuses, Cultivator Hao instinctively skipped over seventh and eighth place, his gaze leaping across the arena to land on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo was currently locked in a fierce battle with the Bronze Gauntlets, wielding a sword and blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Cultivator Hao immediately recognized that Ning Zhuo was at a disadvantage. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Our Rising Cloud Trial's second stage operates on a quota of five", he thought. Once a certain number of cultivators have collected five sets of Profound Armament Armor, the third stage will automatically activate, eliminating those with fewer than five sets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">At Ning Zhuo's current pace, he likely won't make it in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">To learn while undergoing the trial - he certainly has a bold spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Cultivator Hao's thoughts shifted. However, if he truly intends to intercept Ban Ji, given his strength, this might be his only option. After all, in the third stage, the Formation still prohibits cultivators from using external methods, restricting them to the Profound Armament Armor and their physical abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In other words, Ning Zhuo is remarkably confident. He believes he can sharpen his skills on the fly, master the armor, and ultimately stop Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Such confidence... perhaps this is the difference between a genius cultivator and ordinary people like us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Cultivator Hao suppressed his thoughts and secretly transmitted his agreement with divine sense: "Very well. I can help with this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"However..." A peculiar expression crossed his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">He had just reviewed the records and discovered that nearly all cultivators possessed either a sword or a saber, or both. The remaining weapons were few and all possessed unique properties to varying degrees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The Profound Armament Armor stored within the Profound Armor Cave originated from two sources: some were forged by the cave itself, while others were contributions from countless cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">When cultivators donated particularly valuable Profound Armament Armor, the Profound Armor Cave would compensate them with other treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">During each Rising Cloud Trial, the Profound Armor Cave distributed many Profound Armament Armor. Yet every year, cultivators would return to fulfill their promises, returning the Profound Armament Armor they had forged to the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The Grand Formation would randomly select some Profound Armament Armor from the Martial Treasury and deploy them as opponents for the cultivators participating in the trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The remaining Profound Armament Armor were generally special and not freely available for deployment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"These swords and sabers are universally powerful, even posing a challenge to Golden Core cultivators. If we assign one to Ban Ji, can he withstand it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Actually, the bronze shield he's about to face is of exceptional quality. It's the only shield in the second stage of the Rising Cloud Trial. Profound Armament Armor of the shield type can be extremely helpful in the third stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Cultivator Hao considered it and decided there was no need to inform Ban Jie, as it would only prolong the trial and introduce unnecessary complications.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He immediately acted covertly, using his authority to manipulate the Grand Formation. He quietly inserted two bronze swords into the original sequence, simultaneously scrambling the order of all the Bronze Artifacts the participants were supposed to face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Cultivator Hao wasn't worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">This level of intervention fell within the tacitly approved boundaries set by the higher-ups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">After all, the higher-ups were human too, with descendants and friends they needed to look after. This degree of favoritism was just right; even if exposed, the consequences for Cultivator Hao wouldn't be too severe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo slashed diagonally with his blade, the sword tip stabbing straight forward. Left and right, hard and soft, his dual attacks converged on the Bronze Gauntlets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Bronze Gauntlets moved with surprising speed. The left gauntlet traced a precise, short arc, narrowly avoiding the blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo immediately adjusted his technique, switching from a diagonal slash to a downward chop. But the Bronze Gauntlet struck with pinpoint accuracy, landing on the blade's power transfer point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">A dull clang echoed as Ning Zhuo's momentum vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">When Ning Zhuo's right sword struck, the other Bronze Gauntlet brushed against the blade, using a clever twist to deflect the bronze sword outward, sending its tip sliding through the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The Bronze Gauntlets combined brute force with subtle deflections and redirections, alternating between hard and soft, heavy and light, to keep Ning Zhuo on the defensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo frowned, finding the situation increasingly challenging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He had already varied his attacks multiple times, but the Bronze Gauntlets initially seemed "flustered and disoriented" before quickly "adapting" and regaining the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">This gave Ning Zhuo the eerie impression that the gauntlets were sentient, their master invisible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Yet he knew this was merely an illusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"This is a higher realm of martial arts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"The previous Bronze Sword and Blade were merely at the apprentice level. The sword only had basic techniques, while the blade was slightly more advanced, with basic moves, combos, and short routines."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"But with the Bronze Gauntlets, the martial arts have transcended the apprentice stage and reached the artisan level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"The gauntlets not only master various combinations of techniques but also adapt their tactics in real-time based on my movements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"Martial apprentices focus on solitary practice, striving to perfect each technique and combine them seamlessly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Martial artisans, however, incorporate tactical thinking, sensing their opponents and engaging in strategic combat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"I understand now. This is how it works."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo drew upon the vast tactical experience he had acquired through the Burning Boat Soul Crossing Technique, which had granted him access to countless lifetimes of strategic combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo revisited old knowledge and gained profound new insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">He was already capable of improvising in combat, seamlessly blending the real and the illusory, and demonstrating both flexibility and autonomy. The Bronze Gauntlets served as a hands-on instructor, guiding him step by step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">This wasn't a beginner's lesson; it was more like a revival, a re-learning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Consequently, he mastered the techniques with astonishing speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Take this! A combined blade strike!" Ning Zhuo wielded a saber in his left hand and a sword in his right, executing the Wave-Breaking Star-Piercing Stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The bronze saber unleashed a triple wave-breaking strike, while the bronze sword followed with rapid thrusts, knocking one of the Bronze Gauntlets to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo could have pressed his advantage, but he remained rooted in place, allowing the gauntlet to float back and regroup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">After several dozen more exchanges, Ning Zhuo completed his preparations and suddenly unleashed the Silk-Entangling Mountain-Crushing Stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The Bronze Gauntlets struggled to defend, their defenses crumbling. One was cleaved to the ground by the bronze sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Again, Ning Zhuo showed mercy, halting his attack and allowing the gauntlets to resume their assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">After another round of attacks and defenses, Ning Zhuo completed his preparations once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Combined blade strike - Water-Parting Moon-Teasing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Clang! Clang! Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">The saber and sword struck the Bronze Gauntlets like a tempestuous storm, each blow ringing with a crisp clang and showering sparks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Unable to withstand the onslaught, both gauntlets were knocked to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">This time, Ning Zhuo showed no restraint. He immediately abandoned his blades, seized the gauntlets with both hands, pressed down on their backs, and rapidly refined them, claiming them for his own use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The cultivators watching this scene widened their eyes slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">The third technique, the combined sword-blade strike - the one they had the least faith in - had proven to be the most powerful in actual combat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">"Time to pick up the pace," Ning Zhuo muttered, estimating the time. He retracted his gauntlets and continued onward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Soon, he encountered the fourth Profound Armament Armor: a bronze shield.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
