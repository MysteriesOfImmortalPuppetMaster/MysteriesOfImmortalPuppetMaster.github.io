<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 276: Assassination</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">A medium-sized mechanical beast moved its limbs and swiftly departed from Zheng Jian and the others. Zheng Jian focused on the Zheng family cultivator beside him, asking, "How is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Zheng family cultivator looked puzzled, "Strange! The merits I received aren't much. It's not even as good as working alone." Zheng Jian's face darkened, and he remained silent. The Zheng family cultivators around him found it odd. They had clearly imitated Ning Zhuo, so why was there such a disparity in results?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Ning family cultivators, supported by Ning Zhuo, saw their merits soar, each rushing into the Medical Pavilion. On Zheng Jian's side, not only was Zheng Jian himself delayed, but the merit gains for others were also negligible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Should we try again?" a Zheng family cultivator suggested. Zheng Jian shook his head, "Forget it, we've tried three times already, no need to try again." At this moment, he thought of his exploration in the Medical Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Zheng Jian had been sensing his innate talentâ€”Heart-Piercing Insightâ€”throughout. When faced with rooms he couldn't enter, he would indirectly test them using his talent. Most rooms were unremarkable, but when he faced the door to the critical care room and had the urge to break in, his Heart-Piercing Insight was triggered, and alarm bells rang in his mind, warning him that forcing his way in would surely lead to death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"The entire Medical Pavilion has only one critical care room." "There seems to be something peculiar inside." "Ning Zhuo has been in twice, yet I haven't seen any related tasks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Thinking of this, Zheng Jian said to those around him, "Ning Zhuo was once under the control of the Void Sect, and he likely retained some secrets that he hasn't fully disclosed. Among these secrets, there should be results from the Void Sect's infiltration and exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace. That's why he can elevate his companions through joint tasks. However, this is nothing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"The Ning family is ultimately the weakest of the three families. When our clan begins to exert its strength, the disparity in power will be quite evident. Ning Zhuo, a mere Qi Refining junior, won't be able to hold on. We just need to wait for the right opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">When Zheng Jian realized he couldn't defeat Ning Zhuo and the Ning family through legitimate means, he began leveraging the power of his clan to engage in family-level competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In the sky, a flame lizard was spiraling and dancing. When a flame snake grows horns, it becomes a lizard, and most can master the ability to soar. The golden core level aura spread everywhere. Such a scarlet flame beast was extremely difficult to counter with just the mechanical constructs of the Lava Immortal Palace. Unless they deployed mechanical constructs of the level of Dao Masters or Demon Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Jiufan and Zheng Danlian arrived almost simultaneously to rescue the scene. Zheng Danlian, holding a mechanical scythe, smiled at Ning Jiufan, "Brother Ning, why don't you guess if my mechanical weapon can take the life of this flame lizard?" Ning Jiufan's face darkened, "Of course, it can." Zheng Danlian then activated the mechanical scythe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The scythe blade shimmered slightly, as if a phantom light flashed by. In the next moment, the flame lizard, which had been soaring and roaring, was directly cut down. Its demon core was expelled from its body, falling to the ground, and the entire snake body completely disintegrated. In an instant, it lost its life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Jiufan's pupils contracted sharply. Zheng Danlian exhaled a breath of turbid air, a fleeting red glow in his eyes. Although he appeared calm, he had actually exerted his full strength. That activation consumed forty percent of his golden core mana. The consumption was terrifying, but the result was excellent, strongly intimidating Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Brother Ning, congratulations, you guessed right." Zheng Danlian continued to ask, "Now, do you think my mechanical weapon can take the Medical Pavilion?" Ning Jiufan was silent for a while, then said in a muffled voice, "It can."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo walked into Ning Jiufan's study. Over the past few days, he had achieved a lot, promoting most of the Ning family reformation team members into the Medical Pavilion. Once in the Medical Pavilion, he used his position to assign good tasks to the Ning family reformation team, allowing them to gain higher benefits. Currently, the Ning family had already surpassed the Zheng family in the competition for positions in the Medical Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Jiufan coughed and pointed to a stool, "Sit down first." Ning Zhuo sat down. "Take a look at this first." Ning Jiufan handed him several jade slips. Ning Zhuo placed the jade slips on his forehead, and after scanning them with his divine sense, he found they were reports and requests for help from the main branch of the Ning family. The letters stated that the Zheng family had launched a comprehensive attack, repeatedly harassing and targeting various industries of the Ning family, making it difficult for the Ning family to move forward. Some requests for help also came from the black market, from former stewards of the Ning family. The black market, under Ning Zhuo's control, had also encountered incidents, clearly the result of the Zheng family's covert actions. The black market lacked the foundation of the Ning family's main branch and was now in a precarious situation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo snorted coldly, "It seems the Zheng family is determined to take the Medical Pavilion." He then looked at Ning Jiufan, "Ancestor, did you call me here to make us give up?" Ning Jiufan did not express an opinion, only asking, "Ning Zhuo, what do you think we should do now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought. He paced around the study three times before finally standing in front of Ning Jiufan, speaking with a bitter tone, "The Zheng family is strong, and logically, we shouldn't confront them head-on. But I think there might still be a chance. We can seek help from Lord Zhu Xuanji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Jiufan shook his head, "The Zheng family's actions against our Ning family are within the tacitly allowed means. How could Lord Zhu Xuanji favor us?" Ning Zhuo continued, "Then we should ask Lord Meng Kui to uphold justice!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Jiufan was stunned for a moment, then shook his head, "Not appropriate! Our clan has already signed an alliance with Zhu Xuanji, the Zheng family, and the Zhou family. Asking Lord Meng Kui to intervene would be tantamount to betraying the alliance." Ning Zhuo said, "There is a way to solve this. For example, I could split from the family, leading the branch to seek refuge with Meng Kui. After all, most of the reformation team members are from the branch. If Meng Kui can truly protect us, we won't need to retreat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"You brat, always thinking about splitting the family!" Ning Jiufan was so angry that he flicked Ning Zhuo's forehead. This time, Ning Zhuo raised his head, eyes gleaming, "Ancestor, just tell me if my idea has any room for implementation?" Ning Jiufan was slightly taken aback. Upon careful consideration, he realized there might indeed be a possibility for success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Meng Kui wanted to divide the alliance, which was evident to everyone. Otherwise, he wouldn't have employed the strategy of keeping positions unchanged. If Ning Zhuo could indeed split the family and seek refuge with Meng Kui, Meng Kui might gladly accept and then openly intervene in Ning family affairs. With the Ning family's internal affairs being interfered with, the City Lord's Mansion could also take the opportunity to intervene in the alliance and other family affairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">However, after careful consideration, Ning Jiufan still rejected Ning Zhuo's proposal. Splitting the family was too risky!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, "If we can't leverage external forces, we might have to compromise with the Zheng family." Ning Jiufan said, "Very well, Ning Zhuo, you can adapt and recognize the situation, which is indeed rare at your age."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo snorted, "I would prefer to defeat Zheng Jian openly, but unfortunately, our family's strength is weak. I'll meet Zheng Jian again and, under the guise of voluntary retreat, ask him to compensate us with something. Sigh... We can't just retreat for nothing, can we?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Jiufan nodded, "Let's do it that way." Ning Zhuo's letter of request was first delivered to Zheng Jian. After reading it, he passed it to others. The Zheng family reformation team members laughed heartily, their morale visibly rising.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Boss, you predicted it accurately. Ning Zhuo really gave in!" "He had to take a beating before bowing his head. Isn't this person despicable?" "Refusing a toast only to drink a forfeit. Haha, he deserves this outcome. In my opinion, there's no need to meet him. Does he really think he's something special?" Zheng Jian shook his head, "Ning Zhuo indeed has some skills."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Putting aside other things, I have great respect for his mechanical expertise." "Meeting him and discussing further is not a bad idea. I'm somewhat interested in the cooperation he mentioned in his letter." Ning Zhuo and Zheng Jian met again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Zheng Jian cupped his hands in greeting, "Brother Ning." He didn't act arrogantly, but his smile displayed the superiority of an established family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, "Brother Zheng Jian, this time I didn't lose to you, but my Ning family lost to the Zheng family." Zheng Jian nodded, "Exactly. Let's talk about the cooperation you mentioned in your letter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo sighed again, "You should know, I have mastered the pattern. After completing a group task, I can significantly increase my companions' merits." Zheng Jian nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo said, "I can work for your Zheng family, helping your people quickly become medical practitioners. Once they become medical practitioners, with the equipment of the Medical Pavilion and the tasks belonging to medical practitioners, the progress of the Zheng family cultivators will be astonishing!" Zheng Jian was intrigued, "Your proposal is quite tempting. So, what do we need to offer in return?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and tentatively said, "My Ning family needs a few positions in the Medical Pavilion." Zheng Jian immediately shook his head, "That's absolutely impossible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, "What if it's just me retaining a position?" Zheng Jian shook his head again, "Brother Ning Zhuo, I dare not keep you in the Medical Pavilion. After all, above the medical practitioner, there are higher positions. And the higher the position, the fewer there are. If I let you operate in the Medical Pavilion, and you become the head of the Medical Pavilion, I mean the highest position, wouldn't my Zheng family be laughed at?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Isn't there any way?" Ning Zhuo stared at Zheng Jian. Zheng Jian shook his head, "Absolutely not!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Pfft. A soft sound. Zheng Jian's body stiffened, and he slowly lowered his head, incredulously seeing a blade tip protruding from his chest! A single-handed blade had pierced through his back, penetrating to his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo was also stunned for a moment, then suddenly retreated, shouting, "Enemy attack! Enemy attack!!" His voice spread around, and the Zheng family reformation team members, who were nearby, rushed to support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Then, they saw Yang Chanyu withdrawing her single blade, having killed Zheng Jian. Zheng Jian fell to the ground, his eyes wide open, devoid of any life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Yang Chanyu, who practiced the Ancient Cicada Technique, was adept at accumulating power for assassinations. Even Luo Shang had fallen to her sneak attack. Let alone Zheng Jian, who was only at the Qi Refining Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Boss!" "Leader!!" "Demoness, I'll fight you to the death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Zheng family cultivators were furious, their anger reaching its peak, a surge of blood courage making them fearless of Yang Chanyu, who was at the golden core stage. Yang Chanyu, however, ignored them and charged towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo cried for help, and the Oil Slick Talisman on him automatically activated, forming an oily protective shield. Yang Chanyu slashed several times, but all were blocked by the oily shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Interesting." She suddenly stopped, looking towards the southeast, "Next time, I'll take your life, little traitor!" She coldly glared at Ning Zhuo, leaving behind such a chilling remark, then soared into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Leaving Ning Zhuo sitting on the ground, unable to hide his terror, drenched in cold sweat, his soul seemingly lost.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
