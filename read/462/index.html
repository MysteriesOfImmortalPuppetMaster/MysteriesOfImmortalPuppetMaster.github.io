<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 462: Yinyang One Qi Kettle</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">He saw that the Yinyang One Qi Kettle was about three feet tall, its body constructed from red-gold and dark crystal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After Liu Er returned to the military camp, he went straight into his tent to examine the treasure bestowed by his teacher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The red-gold part seemed like blazing flames dancing, while the dark crystal was like a deep and profound night sky, shining with a strange radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Two flood dragons, one a purplish-red and the other a bright blue, coiled around the body of the kettle, spiraling outward. Their dragon bodies curved to form a pair of kettle handles. Then, at the kettle’s neck, they continued to intertwine and climb upward. All the way to the kettle’s spout, the twin dragons faced each other, their open mouths exhaling wisps of vapor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">These vapors were drawn into the kettle’s interior and transformed into red and blue energies, sometimes alternating, sometimes blending, both gorgeous and bewitching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The magic treasures of yao cultivators carried their aesthetic sense, often in such a style—resplendent and multicolored, using bright hues for strong contrast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After observing for a while, Liu Er sensed from the Yinyang One Qi Kettle the former glory of the Blood Slaughter Imperial Dynasty, and he could not help but sigh inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He tried to infuse it with his magical power, but the Yinyang One Qi Kettle showed no reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Liu Er thought: “Master said this treasure is called the Yinyang One Qi Kettle. It might be related to yin and yang energies.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Liu Er was male and possessed abundant yang energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Thinking of this, he attempted to channel his yang energy into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">In the next instant, the Yinyang One Qi Kettle suddenly erupted with an incredibly powerful suction force, swallowing up all the yang energy Liu Er had poured into it in one gulp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Liu Er’s expression changed drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This was because the Yinyang One Qi Kettle not only devoured the external yang energy he released, it also held his palm firmly to the kettle handle, exerting profound power to violently seize the yang energy within his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In that moment, a small whirlwind seemed to arise inside the tent, whirling around Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Liu Er’s eyes widened, his face full of terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He could not move. His entire being was subdued by the Yinyang One Qi Kettle. He could only watch helplessly as the enormous amount of yang energy from his whole body was drawn out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">It lasted for about the time it took to brew a cup of tea before the Yinyang One Qi Kettle stopped generating suction and returned to its original state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Liu Er half-knelt on the ground on the spot, completely drained of strength, letting the Yinyang One Qi Kettle fall to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“What kind of demon treasure is this?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Liu Er’s face was filled with shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He looked at his own hands. The once full, fleshy palms were now skin and bones, and his arms were almost nothing but a layer of skin wrapping around the bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Liu Er’s ears rang, his vision went dark, and his eye sockets sank inward. He looked like a living skeleton, utterly miserable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Moving slowly, he took out a pill and gradually absorbed its medicinal power. It took him about the time it would take to burn a stick of incense before he slowly recovered somewhat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“My yang energy, the prime yang I’ve accumulated for most of my life.” Liu Er wanted to weep but had no tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Although he did not practice pure “boy-arts” of cultivation, due to his master’s strict constraints, he had never let his prime yang energy dissipate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Now, though the prime yang still remained, most of the accumulated yang energy in his body had been sucked dry. This left Liu Er in a weakened state, as if he had indulged in continuous sexual affairs for ten years straight, night and day without pause.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Liu Er continued to study the Yinyang One Qi Kettle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This time, when he picked up the demon kettle, he immediately felt it had grown much heavier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He infused it with magical power again, but still to no effect. However, when he penetrated it with his divine sense, he gained a slight response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Liu Er then continued to release his divine sense, letting it seep deeper into the treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Yinyang One Qi Kettle suddenly activated, and the purplish-red dragon on the kettle’s body became brightly radiant, spewing out streams of yin energy from its mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">When this yin energy came into contact with Liu Er, it merged into his body like a homing swallow returning to its nest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Liu Er showed an astonished expression: “My yang energy has been completely transformed into yin energy?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He absorbed it for a moment, then realized the gravity of the situation: “Stop, stop right now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Fortunately, this time the Yinyang One Qi Kettle obeyed his divine sense command and promptly ceased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Liu Er let out a long sigh of relief. Just now, he had been scared pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“This treasure is truly mysterious. It can actually transform all my yang energy entirely into yin energy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“If I continue like this, wouldn’t I become female in nature, akin to a eunuch?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“No wonder it’s called the Yinyang One Qi Kettle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Liu Er thought about dual cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Normally, dual cultivation involved two energies of yin and yang, coming from a male and a female cultivator respectively. Through their blending, both sides would benefit, boosting each other’s cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">But now, it was yin and yang in one. Whether it was yang energy or yin energy, both came from the same person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“So what is the use of this kettle?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Transforming yin energy… Wait.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Can I do this?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Liu Er sat down cross-legged, guiding the merging of yang and yin energies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He had prime yang within him, and his yang energy continuously regenerated at a rate far surpassing that of ordinary people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">As yang and yin energy intertwined, yin and yang unified. This immediately promoted his cultivation level, rising steadily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“So this is a treasure that increases cultivation speed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Strange…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Why did Master give it to me at this time? If he had given it to me when I first became his disciple, I would have reached Nascent Soul stage by now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Perhaps Master wants me to infiltrate the Two Note Nation with a Golden Core cultivation. After all, the degree of wariness and suspicion triggered by a Golden Core or a Nascent Soul is not the same.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Or maybe Master has other intentions that I have yet to guess.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">While Liu Er was pondering, a subordinate came to report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">It turned out that after Ning Zhuo went to the meeting, Liu Er had felt uneasy and had sent subordinates to secretly follow and attempt to gather intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The subordinate brought two pieces of news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“You say the strategist and Shuang Jing seemed to part on bad terms?” Liu Er felt happy. That was good news indeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Then he heard that “Mu Lan behaved arrogantly and rampaged into the granary, even injuring Zhao Xi.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Liu Er found it a bit odd and shook his head: “Mu Lan is, after all, someone from the Grand Marshal’s estate and thus has backing, so she acts this way. How enviable. If I tried that, I’d be kicked out immediately.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“As for our rations, we didn’t receive them either. It turns out the grain transport team was seized by the Old Stone Monster.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“That old monster is cunning. He cultivates earth-based arts and isn’t honest at all. He’s a ten-thousand-year-old earth essence, as sly as a fox!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Liu Er sighed emotionally. At that moment, another subordinate reported.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This time it was bad news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Upon hearing it, Liu Er could no longer stay calm. He sprang up and exclaimed in a low voice, “What? Third Brother went to break into the Red Flower Camp?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhang Hei, full of anger, charged to the gates of the Red Flower Camp, roaring like thunder: “Mu Lan, get out here now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Mu Lan had just returned to camp, feeling frustrated after being schemed against. Suddenly hearing Zhang Hei’s roar, her face immediately turned furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">She naturally could not let Zhang Hei shout at the camp gate, so she came out at once: “You black fellow, what are you yelling about?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Zhang Hei held a black serpent spear in his hand, pointing it at Mu Lan, and shouted: “Mu Lan! You allowed your subordinates to provoke our forces, using the advantage of numbers to bully the few, beating one of our soldiers until he is on the verge of death. You are too arrogant. During the previous ambush you even pushed the blame onto our side, and then you ran off!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Take out your weapon! Today, let your Elder Zhang teach you how to behave!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
