<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 462: Yinyang One Qi Kettle</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
He saw that the Yinyang One Qi Kettle was about three feet tall, its body constructed from red-gold and dark crystal.<br/>
<br/>
After Liu Er returned to the military camp, he went straight into his tent to examine the treasure bestowed by his teacher.<br/>
<br/>
The red-gold part seemed like blazing flames dancing, while the dark crystal was like a deep and profound night sky, shining with a strange radiance.<br/>
<br/>
Two flood dragons, one a purplish-red and the other a bright blue, coiled around the body of the kettle, spiraling outward. Their dragon bodies curved to form a pair of kettle handles. Then, at the kettle’s neck, they continued to intertwine and climb upward. All the way to the kettle’s spout, the twin dragons faced each other, their open mouths exhaling wisps of vapor.<br/>
<br/>
These vapors were drawn into the kettle’s interior and transformed into red and blue energies, sometimes alternating, sometimes blending, both gorgeous and bewitching.<br/>
<br/>
The magic treasures of yao cultivators carried their aesthetic sense, often in such a style—resplendent and multicolored, using bright hues for strong contrast.<br/>
<br/>
After observing for a while, Liu Er sensed from the Yinyang One Qi Kettle the former glory of the Blood Slaughter Imperial Dynasty, and he could not help but sigh inwardly.<br/>
<br/>
He tried to infuse it with his magical power, but the Yinyang One Qi Kettle showed no reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er thought: “Master said this treasure is called the Yinyang One Qi Kettle. It might be related to yin and yang energies.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was male and possessed abundant yang energy.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, he attempted to channel his yang energy into it.<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, the Yinyang One Qi Kettle suddenly erupted with an incredibly powerful suction force, swallowing up all the yang energy Liu Er had poured into it in one gulp.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s expression changed drastically.<br/>
<br/>
This was because the Yinyang One Qi Kettle not only devoured the external yang energy he released, it also held his palm firmly to the kettle handle, exerting profound power to violently seize the yang energy within his body.<br/>
<br/>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…<br/>
<br/>
In that moment, a small whirlwind seemed to arise inside the tent, whirling around Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s eyes widened, his face full of terror.<br/>
<br/>
He could not move. His entire being was subdued by the Yinyang One Qi Kettle. He could only watch helplessly as the enormous amount of yang energy from his whole body was drawn out.<br/>
<br/>
It lasted for about the time it took to brew a cup of tea before the Yinyang One Qi Kettle stopped generating suction and returned to its original state.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er half-knelt on the ground on the spot, completely drained of strength, letting the Yinyang One Qi Kettle fall to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
“What kind of demon treasure is this?!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s face was filled with shock.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at his own hands. The once full, fleshy palms were now skin and bones, and his arms were almost nothing but a layer of skin wrapping around the bones.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s ears rang, his vision went dark, and his eye sockets sank inward. He looked like a living skeleton, utterly miserable.<br/>
<br/>
Moving slowly, he took out a pill and gradually absorbed its medicinal power. It took him about the time it would take to burn a stick of incense before he slowly recovered somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
“My yang energy, the prime yang I’ve accumulated for most of my life.” Liu Er wanted to weep but had no tears.<br/>
<br/>
Although he did not practice pure “boy-arts” of cultivation, due to his master’s strict constraints, he had never let his prime yang energy dissipate.<br/>
<br/>
Now, though the prime yang still remained, most of the accumulated yang energy in his body had been sucked dry. This left Liu Er in a weakened state, as if he had indulged in continuous sexual affairs for ten years straight, night and day without pause.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er continued to study the Yinyang One Qi Kettle.<br/>
<br/>
This time, when he picked up the demon kettle, he immediately felt it had grown much heavier.<br/>
<br/>
He infused it with magical power again, but still to no effect. However, when he penetrated it with his divine sense, he gained a slight response.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er then continued to release his divine sense, letting it seep deeper into the treasure.<br/>
<br/>
The Yinyang One Qi Kettle suddenly activated, and the purplish-red dragon on the kettle’s body became brightly radiant, spewing out streams of yin energy from its mouth.<br/>
<br/>
When this yin energy came into contact with Liu Er, it merged into his body like a homing swallow returning to its nest.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er showed an astonished expression: “My yang energy has been completely transformed into yin energy?”<br/>
<br/>
He absorbed it for a moment, then realized the gravity of the situation: “Stop, stop right now!”<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, this time the Yinyang One Qi Kettle obeyed his divine sense command and promptly ceased.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er let out a long sigh of relief. Just now, he had been scared pale.<br/>
<br/>
“This treasure is truly mysterious. It can actually transform all my yang energy entirely into yin energy.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I continue like this, wouldn’t I become female in nature, akin to a eunuch?”<br/>
<br/>
“No wonder it’s called the Yinyang One Qi Kettle.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er thought about dual cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, dual cultivation involved two energies of yin and yang, coming from a male and a female cultivator respectively. Through their blending, both sides would benefit, boosting each other’s cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
But now, it was yin and yang in one. Whether it was yang energy or yin energy, both came from the same person.<br/>
<br/>
“So what is the use of this kettle?”<br/>
<br/>
“Transforming yin energy… Wait.”<br/>
<br/>
“Can I do this?”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er sat down cross-legged, guiding the merging of yang and yin energies.<br/>
<br/>
He had prime yang within him, and his yang energy continuously regenerated at a rate far surpassing that of ordinary people.<br/>
<br/>
As yang and yin energy intertwined, yin and yang unified. This immediately promoted his cultivation level, rising steadily.<br/>
<br/>
“So this is a treasure that increases cultivation speed.”<br/>
<br/>
“Strange…”<br/>
<br/>
“Why did Master give it to me at this time? If he had given it to me when I first became his disciple, I would have reached Nascent Soul stage by now.”<br/>
<br/>
“Perhaps Master wants me to infiltrate the Two Note Nation with a Golden Core cultivation. After all, the degree of wariness and suspicion triggered by a Golden Core or a Nascent Soul is not the same.”<br/>
<br/>
“Or maybe Master has other intentions that I have yet to guess.”<br/>
<br/>
While Liu Er was pondering, a subordinate came to report.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that after Ning Zhuo went to the meeting, Liu Er had felt uneasy and had sent subordinates to secretly follow and attempt to gather intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
The subordinate brought two pieces of news.<br/>
<br/>
“You say the strategist and Shuang Jing seemed to part on bad terms?” Liu Er felt happy. That was good news indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Then he heard that “Mulan behaved arrogantly and rampaged into the granary, even injuring Zhao Xi.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er found it a bit odd and shook his head: “Mulan is, after all, someone from the Grand Marshal’s estate and thus has backing, so she acts this way. How enviable. If I tried that, I’d be kicked out immediately.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for our rations, we didn’t receive them either. It turns out the grain transport team was seized by the Old Stone Monster.”<br/>
<br/>
“That old monster is cunning. He cultivates earth-based arts and isn’t honest at all. He’s a ten-thousand-year-old earth essence, as sly as a fox!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er sighed emotionally. At that moment, another subordinate reported.<br/>
<br/>
This time it was bad news.<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing it, Liu Er could no longer stay calm. He sprang up and exclaimed in a low voice, “What? Third Brother went to break into the Red Flower Camp?!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei, full of anger, charged to the gates of the Red Flower Camp, roaring like thunder: “Mulan, get out here now!”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan had just returned to camp, feeling frustrated after being schemed against. Suddenly hearing Zhang Hei’s roar, her face immediately turned furious.<br/>
<br/>
She naturally could not let Zhang Hei shout at the camp gate, so she came out at once: “You black fellow, what are you yelling about?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei held a black serpent spear in his hand, pointing it at Mulan, and shouted: “Mulan! You allowed your subordinates to provoke our forces, using the advantage of numbers to bully the few, beating one of our soldiers until he is on the verge of death. You are too arrogant. During the previous ambush you even pushed the blame onto our side, and then you ran off!”<br/>
<br/>
“Take out your weapon! Today, let your Elder Zhang teach you how to behave!”</div>
