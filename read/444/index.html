<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 444: Lord Long vs. the White Jade Battalion</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The entire White Jade Battalion was filled with wails.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Lord Long displayed an absolutely powerful attacking posture; as soon as he made his move, he directly broke through the battle formation's Dharma Aspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Because this was a moving formation, every cultivator was a component of it. Therefore, when the Dharma Aspect was broken, all the members participating in the formation suffered backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Lord Long stood tall like a mountain, proudly gazing around in all directions, then lowered his head and rubbed his fingers, calmly commenting, "Insufficient training; the Dharma Aspect is mere form without substance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Is there anything else? Bring it all out for me to see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This arrogant posture did not suppress the morale of the cultivators of the White Jade Battalion; instead, it enraged them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Hey! This old geezer is quite arrogant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Brothers, let's get him together!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"A mere Nascent Soul level, daring to step into our military formation â€”courting death!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Without waiting for Commander Shuang Jing's orders, his deputy commanders swarmed out and launched a siege on Lord Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">There were seven deputy commanders in total, all at the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Shuang Jing was positioned somewhat at the rear, riding his mount, shouting loudly, "Change formation! Change formation!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Holding the General's Seal in his hand, he used divine sense to transmit the upcoming formation changes to the entire army rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But most of the soldiers of the White Jade Battalion had not yet recovered; many were screaming, moaning in unbearable pain, and some even fainted on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Seeing this, Shuang Jing immediately took out a stack of command tokens from his bosom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">These tokens were instruments of military tacticsâ€”red plaques with golden characters, imposing and majestic. The military command tokens had a triangular shape at the top, tapering down like a stout treasured sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Shuang Jing threw these tokens out one after another, continuously shouting, "Military situation urgent as fire, quickly form the formation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Military situation urgent as fire, quickly form the formation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Military situation urgent as fire, quickly form the formation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In the next moment, the soldiers who had just been unable to get up were lifted by an invisible force, forcibly dragged to their positions in the battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Some could barely walk; others were directly dragged along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Some were even more unlucky, shouting, "Don't drag me, don't drag me! Ah, I'm about to do the splits!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">By forcibly forming the formation like this, Shuang Jing quickly built a second battle formation â€”the Seven Stars Gathering Power Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">As this formation slowly activated, starlight immediately shone brilliantly, like thousands of fireflies dancing. These starlights gathered above the heads of the seven Golden Core deputy commanders, like seven beams of light pouring into their bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The deputy commanders howled, their bodies directly growing two or three inches taller, their aura surging, spiritual power gushing wildly, and their combat power instantly soaring several times!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"This is the feeling â€”I am ridiculously strong!!" one Golden Core deputy commander howled, charging toward Lord Long first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Lord Long sidestepped, avoiding his attack, then pushed out with a giant palm, hitting the ribs of the Golden Core deputy commander.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Golden Core deputy commander was like a ball, knocked flying far away before landing on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Aooo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The sound of a dragon's roar rose again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He almost crashed into his comrades; fortunately, Shuang Jing timely used his commander's power to directly move the cultivators in that area away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Golden Core deputy commander spat out a mouthful of blood, sat down cross-legged immediately, and began emergency healing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Because after his ribs were broken, they directly pierced his lungs. Such an injury forced him to temporarily withdraw from the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Lord Long's Dragon Roar Palm kept striking, and with each swing of his palm, there was the sound of a dragon's roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Roar, roar, roar..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The dragon roars rose one after another; the Golden Core deputy commanders were successively knocked flying, landing on the ground like sandbags.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">But soon, they all stood up again, spat out a mouthful of blood or spat out the teeth that had been knocked loose, and charged again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The battle armor and other equipment on them, although standard and the same as everyone else's, were still very exquisite and of high quality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Even though the cultivation methods they practiced were different, the same equipment could better bring out the power of the battle formation. Don't forget, there was also the support of national power and military strength, allowing them to directly confront terrifying Nascent Soul-level combat power like Lord Long's, and even have one or two exchanges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Lord Long was experienced; in his long life, it was not the first time he had charged into a battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">But this time, he clearly felt that the White Jade Battalion's formation had great stamina and toughness. The seven Golden Core deputy commanders, although not his match even for one move, would get knocked away but come back again, like balls bouncing off a wall, making him extremely annoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Anger surged in Lord Long's heart; he suddenly changed his offensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Divine Bestowed Technique â€”Withered Wood Meets Spring!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Martial Art â€”Withered Dragon Claw!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Divine technique and martial art overlapped; Lord Long changed from palm to claw, suddenly grabbing a certain Golden Core deputy commander.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">His five fingertips were extremely sharp, directly piercing the arm of the Golden Core deputy commander, embedding deep into the muscle, reaching the bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Golden Core deputy commander groaned, attacking frantically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Let him go!!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The other deputy commanders hurriedly surrounded, launching fierce attacks from all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Lord Long stood firm without dodging, chest held high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Divine Bestowed Technique â€”â€”Divine Dragon Treasure Body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In an instant, his whole body glowed, forming a semi-transparent dragon scale armor that covered his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The attacks of the Golden Core deputy commanders landed on the dragon scale armor, only causing the scales to ripple, emitting crisp clanging sounds, unable to harm Lord Long's inner body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">On the other hand, the Golden Core deputy commander whose arm was grabbed screamed miserably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">His voice was extremely shrill; his whole person seemed to shrink, rapidly transforming from a robust man into an emaciated invalidâ€”cheekbones protruding, eye sockets deep-set, life aura turning from prosperity to decline, and his full head of black hair turning snow white in a few breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Lord Long sneered; the arm in his hand was instantly drained into a dried corpse, which he casually discarded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"His life force was absorbed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"What a vicious method."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"What should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"I'll handle it!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A Golden Core deputy commander made a prompt decision, wielded his treasured blade, and slashed fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The blade light was extremely sharp, directly severing the screaming Golden Core deputy commander's arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Golden Core deputy commander regained himself and retreated frantically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The other deputy commanders cooperated tacitly, surrounding and attacking to cover his retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Why the hurry?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"All your life forces are my nourishment!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Golden Core deputy commanders fell into a bitter battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">They were only at the Golden Core level. Normally, with the support of the battle formation, they could completely confront and entangle a Nascent Soul-level enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">But Lord Long himself was at the peak of Nascent Soul cultivation, and with the terrifying blessing of Dragon King's divine power, his overall combat power was about to surpass the Nascent Soul level, almost reaching quasi-Soul Formation â€”nothing less!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"This old man is really formidable; only if I personally take action can we deal with him," Shuang Jing keenly observed the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He was a disciple of a high sect and not cowardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">At this moment, facing a strong enemy, there was fear in his heart, but even more was passionate fighting spirit â€”if he could take down Lord Long, how much military merit would that be!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"With this military merit, returning to the royal capital, I will surely be ennobled."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"If this battle succeeds, even if I then retreat to the second line under the pretext of serious injuries, no one can criticize me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The more Shuang Jing thought, the more excited he became, and he took out a medicine bottle from his bosom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He opened the bottle cap and swallowed a Nascent Soul-level pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Whoosh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">His aura surged by thirty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He then opened another medicine bottle and raised his head, pouring all the medicinal powder inside into his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">His aura surged another thirty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
