The next day, the sky was clear.<br/>
<br/>
The gates of the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect opened wide. Lin Bufan stood at the entrance, gazing into the sky. The disciples at the Foundation Establishment level were lined up along both sides of the mountain path, standing tall and brimming with energy. They stood in respectful silence, awaiting the arrival of distinguished guests.<br/>
<br/>
Many cultivators stood in the distance, watching eagerly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan, the Golden Core ancestor of the Ning family, descended slowly from the clouds, clad in a green robe, and landed before the gates of the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect.<br/>
<br/>
To his left stood an aged Fire-Fusion Demon Ape, while on his right was a handsome young man in white with a noticeably large head.<br/>
<br/>
These were none other than Aunt Xi and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan greeted Lin Bufan with a respectful bow and said, "Master Lin, over a decade ago, when my entire clan was migrating, we received invaluable assistance from the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect. I have always remembered this kindness. Today, I come to pay my respects, and it is an honor to have you personally welcome me."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan smiled gently and nodded. "Daoist Ning, we meet again."<br/>
<br/>
His gaze fell on Aunt Xi, and he thought to himself, "As expected, a Nascent Soul-level demon ape!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan introduced, "This is my spirit pet, Aunt Xi. I am fortunate to have her assistance."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan laughed heartily, waved his broad sleeves, and made a gesture of invitation, saying, "Daoist Ning, please follow me. We’ve prepared some fine spiritual tea, and it’s been waiting for you."<br/>
<br/>
Under the watchful eyes of many, Ning Zhuo, expressionless, walked alongside Ning Jiufan, boldly passing through the gates of the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect and entering the inner mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The Lin Shanshan’s senior disciples watched with displeasure, while those observing from afar murmured amongst themselves.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo is indeed the young master of the Ning family."<br/>
<br/>
"To have the Golden Core ancestor of the Ning family by his side shows how much he is favored."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo is clearly different from us rogue cultivators."<br/>
<br/>
Some cultivators were envious, some jealous, and others sighed with admiration.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi and Han Zhou were among the crowd as well.<br/>
<br/>
It was only after Ning Jiufan, Ning Zhuo, and their entourage disappeared into the pavilions of the inner mountain that Hua Guzi averted her gaze, feeling somewhat disheartened.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou was about to bid her farewell, but she stopped him.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi said, "Come, Han Zhou, let's have a sparring match!"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou, sensing danger, immediately refused.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi snorted coldly, "Normally, the three of us take turns sparring. Now that Young Master Ning Zhuo isn’t here, are you afraid?"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou looked miserable. "Daoist Hua, if you insist, I will have no choice but to accompany you. But let me make one thing clear—"<br/>
<br/>
"Even if you defeat me, it won’t change the difference in status between you and Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"Shut up!" Hua Guzi's eyes filled with bloodshot anger.<br/>
<br/>
Her sudden burst of energy startled the nearby cultivators, who immediately became cautious, sensing she was on the verge of losing control.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou quickly tried to calm her. "Daoist Hua, please be reasonable. If you want to duel, it’s best to do so in the martial arena. Fighting here violates sect rules, which could lead to penalties or even expulsion."<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi reluctantly suppressed her anger and stormed off back to the Little Contention Peak.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the reception hall on the inner mountain.<br/>
<br/>
After a round of tea and pleasantries, Ning Jiufan presented the gifts he had carefully prepared.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan accepted them and directly asked, "Daoist Ning, what brings you here today?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was straightforward about his requests. First, he needed to heal the demon ape’s injuries. Second, he sought an alliance between the Ning family and the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect.<br/>
<br/>
"My family has now firmly established itself in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and is actively expanding."<br/>
<br/>
"I hope this time we can work together for deeper cooperation."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan stroked his beard with a smile. "That can be arranged."<br/>
<br/>
Although his attitude seemed warm, in the negotiations that followed, Lin Bufan showed no signs of the earlier casual agreement. Instead, he argued every point meticulously, refusing to concede even an inch.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan’s eloquence in debate left Ning Jiufan struggling, and he found himself gradually overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Ning Zhuo boldly stepped in to argue a few rounds with Lin Bufan, but he too quickly fell into a disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
However, this impressed Lin Bufan.<br/>
<br/>
He praised softly, "Young Ning Zhuo, as the head of a branch family, you indeed have some talent."<br/>
<br/>
This remark made it clear that Lin Bufan had already gathered significant information on Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the Ning family, and Ning Zhuo himself.<br/>
<br/>
With this knowledge, Lin Bufan held the upper hand in the negotiations.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo outperform him, Ning Jiufan wisely took a back seat, allowing Ning Zhuo to handle the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Though Ning Zhuo’s debating skills were formidable, Lin Bufan was even more skilled!<br/>
<br/>
Having managed the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect for over six centuries, Lin Bufan had vast experience in both life and business negotiations, while Ning Zhuo, at only sixteen, couldn’t compare.<br/>
<br/>
Forced into a corner, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to adopt a humble posture, relying on his status as a junior to avoid further defeat. This made it difficult for Lin Bufan, as a senior Nascent Soul cultivator, to press him too hard.<br/>
<br/>
When the preliminary agreement was reached, Lin Bufan appeared calm and smiling, while Ning Zhuo was drenched in sweat.<br/>
<br/>
After the initial clashes, Ning Zhuo had been on the defensive, enduring blow after blow.<br/>
<br/>
"Young Ning Zhuo, are you truly only sixteen? May I check your bones?" Lin Bufan asked with a smile.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo naturally complied.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan touched his hand and nodded. "Indeed, a sixteen-year-old boy, still untouched. Very good, keep it that way."<br/>
<br/>
"As this is our first meeting, I must offer you a small gift as a senior."<br/>
<br/>
"What would you like? Feel free to ask."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up, and he immediately requested, "Could you perhaps lift the confinement of Lady Lin?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan’s smile faded slightly.<br/>
<br/>
He shook his head gently. "I punished Shanshan because she had neglected her daily duties and became too reckless."<br/>
<br/>
"Thus, I confined her to help her learn from her mistakes."<br/>
<br/>
"It’s for her own good. Young Ning, choose another request."<br/>
<br/>
Feeling embarrassed, Ning Zhuo smiled awkwardly. "I’ve often heard from Lady Lin about the great deeds and prowess of your sect’s Senior Disciple, Linghu Jiu, who is also your first disciple."<br/>
<br/>
"I’ve long admired Linghu Jiu. Recently, it was he who helped resolve some troubles for me."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo requested to visit Linghu Jiu in the Myriad Beasts Cave to express his gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan remained silent for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan interjected at the right moment, saying, "From my humble perspective, Ning Zhuo will undoubtedly be a pillar of our family. Similarly, Linghu will be a key figure in your sect. Having them meet and build a connection would benefit both sides."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan finally nodded. He offered other resources as a gift instead, but Ning Zhuo insisted on his request, and Lin Bufan had no choice but to agree.<br/>
<br/>
With the framework of the alliance settled, Ning Zhuo left the rest of the discussions to Ning Jiufan and headed to the back of Great Contention Peak with a wine jug in hand.<br/>
