<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
A moment before.<br/>
<br/>
“Report! General, the No. 6 armory is empty. All the pills inside have been seized by the stone monster!”<br/>
<br/>
A Golden Core-level deputy general, upon receiving the latest military intelligence, secretly gritted his teeth, quickly withdrew from the besieging troops, and arrived at the No. 6 armory.<br/>
<br/>
He opened his storage belt and mobilized his divine sense. The armory was filled with shields.<br/>
<br/>
Moon Phase Shields!<br/>
<br/>
These shields were circular, their surfaces smooth as mirrors, pure and immaculate. A circle of silver lines outlined the shield’s edge, and the entire shield emitted a faint halo.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, the No. 6 armory has been resupplied with equipment again.” Within the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, upon discovering this, Sun Lingtong immediately called out.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after, the “Old Stone Monster” visited once more, sweeping away all of the Moon Phase Shields.<br/>
<br/>
This type of weapon was also a classic, with many functions.<br/>
<br/>
It could absorb moonlight, causing the shield’s surface to form various moon phases.<br/>
<br/>
These moon phases were: First Quarter Moon, Crescent Moon, New Moon, Waning Moon, Last Quarter Moon, Gibbous (Waning) Moon, Full Moon, and Gibbous (Waxing) Moon.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on each moon phase, the might of the Moon Phase Shield varied. If combined with a battle formation, it would have many different wonderful uses.<br/>
<br/>
After collecting all these Moon Phase Shields, Ning Zhuo murmured, “This is already the third time, right?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes,” Sun Lingtong nodded.<br/>
<br/>
Just after they had stolen a large amount of military equipment, the White Jade Camp promptly resupplied it.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s expression was strange: “Though they are replenishing their armaments to maintain their military strength, their actions somehow feel like they’re providing resources to the enemy.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: “They are worried that this Nascent Soul-level cultivator, the ‘Old Stone Monster,’ might join forces with Lord Long.”<br/>
<br/>
“That’s why they’re using this tactic to stall us.”<br/>
<br/>
“I must say, this is a very calm and rational strategy. Although Shuangjing’s battlefield experience is weak, being appointed as the commander of the White Jade Camp means he’s no mediocre talent.”<br/>
<br/>
Under such circumstances, it was undoubtedly very advantageous for Sun and Ning.<br/>
<br/>
Before, they had worried that after robbing most of the armaments, it would weaken the military strength, causing Lord Long to crush the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Now, however, the White Jade Camp’s officers were replenishing supplies so promptly that it dispelled Sun and Ning’s concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Just as they picked their next target, a phoenix’s cry resounded throughout heaven and earth.<br/>
<br/>
This caused them to steal even more happily.<br/>
<br/>
Then, they saw a blazing arrow, so swift that it left a splendid, fiery afterimage in their vision.<br/>
<br/>
The arrow struck directly at Lord Long’s heart. Even though there was spirit-treasure-level shoulder armor for protection, it still failed to stop this arrow!<br/>
<br/>
This sudden and shocking event made Sun and Ning both turn pale.<br/>
<br/>
“Lord Long… is he actually going to be killed in action?”<br/>
<br/>
“He won’t die. He’s a Nascent Soul-level cultivator; a Nascent Soul can penetrate the void. The White Jade Camp doesn’t have anything to seal the void.”<br/>
<br/>
“Mulan… that Red-Heart Swan Arrow divine ability… how powerful! With such methods, it’s no wonder she mobilized the entire army to reinforce the White Jade Camp.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning’s expressions were complicated.<br/>
<br/>
Just a moment ago, they were worried that their rampant theft of armaments would drag down the White Jade Camp, causing its defeat.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, Lord Long suffered a fatal injury!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sighed: “On the battlefield, too many factors influence victory or defeat. Even someone as strong as Lord Long can suddenly suffer a heavy blow. If we small fry went in, we’d be crushed to pieces in no time.”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s still better for us this way —less risk, and we can seize a large amount of treasure.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, lamenting, “So, when we conduct ourselves, it’s best not to show off recklessly. Being modest and prudent is never wrong.”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long halted and looked down at his own chest.<br/>
<br/>
His physical cultivation was not yet sufficient to allow him to survive without a heart.<br/>
<br/>
His life force was rapidly diminishing.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long became extremely tense. He suddenly lifted his head, looked to the sky, and raised his arms, shouting: “Earth and wood engender vitality, endlessly renewing. Hear the mandate of heaven, Dragon God descend!”<br/>
<br/>
“Great Ginseng Dragon King, please grant your believer the power to return from death!!”<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, the divine ginseng whiskers Lord Long carried began to grow wildly. The ginseng whiskers spread out, turning into countless strands of tendrils that burrowed into his body, filling his blood vessels and entwining his internal organs.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, at the hollow in his left chest, they condensed into a wooden heart.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the heart formed, it began to beat violently.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, the ginseng whiskers wove into a net, sealing both the front and back of the hole in Lord Long’s chest.<br/>
<br/>
“Ahhhhh——!” Lord Long howled toward the sky, screaming miserably in pain.<br/>
<br/>
His body was already burly and beyond the ordinary. Now it swelled again, turning into a giant!<br/>
<br/>
“Come, ants, experience the might of my Lord.”<br/>
<br/>
All the flesh of Lord Long’s body turned wooden, and his voice became incomparably ancient and hoarse.<br/>
<br/>
Boom.<br/>
<br/>
He stomped his right foot to the ground, immediately crushing the rocky surface into a deep pit.<br/>
<br/>
The earth shook violently, and simultaneously, a large number of ginseng whiskers emerged from underground, piercing the soldiers’ limbs and then wrapping them up.<br/>
<br/>
The White Jade Camp’s formation fell into chaos. The cultivators’ vitality was absorbed by the ginseng whiskers and then transferred into Lord Long’s body, causing his combat strength to soar once more!<br/>
<br/>
Two Golden Core deputy generals failed to dodge. One was seized by Lord Long’s giant hand and directly crushed into pulp. The other was kicked flying, his bones all shattered, sent soaring high and out of the entire battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
“Dragon Whisker Qi, absorbing life and essence! Wood and earth take root, ginseng whiskers show their might!”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long’s voice was like a great bell and drum, resounding in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, hundreds and thousands of ginseng whiskers burst out from his body, launching a frenzied assault on the surroundings!<br/>
<br/>
The whiskers were like dragons or pythons, their assault incomparably awe-inspiring.<br/>
<br/>
The White Jade Camp’s cultivators were skewered by the ginseng whiskers and lifted into midair, then quickly turned into one armored corpse after another.<br/>
<br/>
With this single strike, more than three hundred people perished!<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing’s expression changed drastically.<br/>
<br/>
The entire White Jade Camp was terrified. Its military strength plummeted below all limits. With excessively heavy casualties, the entire battle formation collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
He (Shuangjing) had received multiple boosts from formation power, military strength, and national strength. With the battle formation broken and the army’s strength drastically reduced, Shuangjing’s combat power and aura plummeted, leaving him dispirited!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s eyes widened: “Lord Long has risen again!”<br/>
<br/>
On the contrary, the White Jade Camp collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
The Ginseng Whisker Dragon King, Soul Formation level might —truly terrifying.<br/>
<br/>
Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi supported Mulan, both dumbfounded.<br/>
<br/>
He had just been cheering with joy, but now he saw the White Jade Camp completely collapse, countless soldiers slaughtered.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning exchanged a glance. In the next moment, both moved simultaneously, rushing toward Shuangjing.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long also acted. More than a dozen ginseng whiskers beneath his waist whipped about, carrying fierce gusts of wind, lashing at Shuangjing.<br/>
<br/>
Earth-Walk Technique!<br/>
<br/>
The Old Stone Monster traveled underground.<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing dodged in all directions. At critical moments, he even rolled on the ground, wretched and utterly without the bearing of a noble disciple.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s too late!”<br/>
<br/>
A ginseng whisker emerged from underground, and a massive shadow enveloped Shuangjing.<br/>
<br/>
With his life hanging by a thread, Shuangjing hurriedly threw out the “Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings,” struggling to mobilize the army’s strength to block the ginseng whisker.<br/>
<br/>
As for that “Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings,” it fell from high above and was neatly caught by a stone sphere.<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing fled madly.<br/>
<br/>
With the main commander fleeing, the last bit of morale completely collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long locked his gaze on Shuangjing and pursued.<br/>
<br/>
Void Refinement-level!<br/>
<br/>
This is a Void Refinement-level war treasure!!</div>
