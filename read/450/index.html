<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 450: Requesting the Divine Dragon King</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">A moment before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“Report! General, the No. 6 armory is empty. All the pills inside have been seized by the stone monster!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A Golden Core-level deputy general, upon receiving the latest military intelligence, secretly gritted his teeth, quickly withdrew from the besieging troops, and arrived at the No. 6 armory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He opened his storage belt and mobilized his divine sense. The armory was filled with shields.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Moon Phase Shields!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">These shields were circular, their surfaces smooth as mirrors, pure and immaculate. A circle of silver lines outlined the shield’s edge, and the entire shield emitted a faint halo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Little Zhuo, the No. 6 armory has been resupplied with equipment again.” Within the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, upon discovering this, Sun Lingtong immediately called out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Not long after, the “Old Stone Monster” visited once more, sweeping away all of the Moon Phase Shields.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This type of weapon was also a classic, with many functions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">It could absorb moonlight, causing the shield’s surface to form various moon phases.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">These moon phases were: First Quarter Moon, Crescent Moon, New Moon, Waning Moon, Last Quarter Moon, Gibbous (Waning) Moon, Full Moon, and Gibbous (Waxing) Moon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Depending on each moon phase, the might of the Moon Phase Shield varied. If combined with a battle formation, it would have many different wonderful uses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After collecting all these Moon Phase Shields, Ning Zhuo murmured, “This is already the third time, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Yes,” Sun Lingtong nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Just after they had stolen a large amount of military equipment, the White Jade Camp promptly resupplied it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong’s expression was strange: “Though they are replenishing their armaments to maintain their military strength, their actions somehow feel like they’re providing resources to the enemy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo: “They are worried that this Nascent Soul-level cultivator, the ‘Old Stone Monster,’ might join forces with Lord Long.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“That’s why they’re using this tactic to stall us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“I must say, this is a very calm and rational strategy. Although Shuangjing’s battlefield experience is weak, being appointed as the commander of the White Jade Camp means he’s no mediocre talent.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Under such circumstances, it was undoubtedly very advantageous for Sun and Ning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Before, they had worried that after robbing most of the armaments, it would weaken the military strength, causing Lord Long to crush the White Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Now, however, the White Jade Camp’s officers were replenishing supplies so promptly that it dispelled Sun and Ning’s concerns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Just as they picked their next target, a phoenix’s cry resounded throughout heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">This caused them to steal even more happily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Then, they saw a blazing arrow, so swift that it left a splendid, fiery afterimage in their vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The arrow struck directly at Lord Long’s heart. Even though there was spirit-treasure-level shoulder armor for protection, it still failed to stop this arrow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">This sudden and shocking event made Sun and Ning both turn pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Lord Long… is he actually going to be killed in action?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“He won’t die. He’s a Nascent Soul-level cultivator; a Nascent Soul can penetrate the void. The White Jade Camp doesn’t have anything to seal the void.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Mu Lan… that Red-Heart Swan Arrow divine ability… how powerful! With such methods, it’s no wonder she mobilized the entire army to reinforce the White Jade Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Sun and Ning’s expressions were complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Just a moment ago, they were worried that their rampant theft of armaments would drag down the White Jade Camp, causing its defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">But in the next moment, Lord Long suffered a fatal injury!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong sighed: “On the battlefield, too many factors influence victory or defeat. Even someone as strong as Lord Long can suddenly suffer a heavy blow. If we small fry went in, we’d be crushed to pieces in no time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“It’s still better for us this way —less risk, and we can seize a large amount of treasure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo nodded, lamenting, “So, when we conduct ourselves, it’s best not to show off recklessly. Being modest and prudent is never wrong.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Lord Long halted and looked down at his own chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">His physical cultivation was not yet sufficient to allow him to survive without a heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His life force was rapidly diminishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Lord Long became extremely tense. He suddenly lifted his head, looked to the sky, and raised his arms, shouting: “Earth and wood engender vitality, endlessly renewing. Hear the mandate of heaven, Dragon God descend!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Great Ginseng Dragon King, please grant your believer the power to return from death!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">In the next instant, the divine ginseng whiskers Lord Long carried began to grow wildly. The ginseng whiskers spread out, turning into countless strands of tendrils that burrowed into his body, filling his blood vessels and entwining his internal organs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Finally, at the hollow in his left chest, they condensed into a wooden heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As soon as the heart formed, it began to beat violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">At the same time, the ginseng whiskers wove into a net, sealing both the front and back of the hole in Lord Long’s chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Ahhhhh——!” Lord Long howled toward the sky, screaming miserably in pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">His body was already burly and beyond the ordinary. Now it swelled again, turning into a giant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Come, ants, experience the might of my Lord.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">All the flesh of Lord Long’s body turned wooden, and his voice became incomparably ancient and hoarse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He stomped his right foot to the ground, immediately crushing the rocky surface into a deep pit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The earth shook violently, and simultaneously, a large number of ginseng whiskers emerged from underground, piercing the soldiers’ limbs and then wrapping them up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The White Jade Camp’s formation fell into chaos. The cultivators’ vitality was absorbed by the ginseng whiskers and then transferred into Lord Long’s body, causing his combat strength to soar once more!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Two Golden Core deputy generals failed to dodge. One was seized by Lord Long’s giant hand and directly crushed into pulp. The other was kicked flying, his bones all shattered, sent soaring high and out of the entire battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Dragon Whisker Qi, absorbing life and essence! Wood and earth take root, ginseng whiskers show their might!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Lord Long’s voice was like a great bell and drum, resounding in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">In the next moment, hundreds and thousands of ginseng whiskers burst out from his body, launching a frenzied assault on the surroundings!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The whiskers were like dragons or pythons, their assault incomparably awe-inspiring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The White Jade Camp’s cultivators were skewered by the ginseng whiskers and lifted into midair, then quickly turned into one armored corpse after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">With this single strike, more than three hundred people perished!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Shuangjing’s expression changed drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The entire White Jade Camp was terrified. Its military strength plummeted below all limits. With excessively heavy casualties, the entire battle formation collapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He (Shuangjing) had received multiple boosts from formation power, military strength, and national strength. With the battle formation broken and the army’s strength drastically reduced, Shuangjing’s combat power and aura plummeted, leaving him dispirited!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong’s eyes widened: “Lord Long has risen again!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">On the contrary, the White Jade Camp collapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Ginseng Whisker Dragon King, Soul Formation level might —truly terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhang Chongyi supported Mu Lan, both dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He had just been cheering with joy, but now he saw the White Jade Camp completely collapse, countless soldiers slaughtered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sun and Ning exchanged a glance. In the next moment, both moved simultaneously, rushing toward Shuangjing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Lord Long also acted. More than a dozen ginseng whiskers beneath his waist whipped about, carrying fierce gusts of wind, lashing at Shuangjing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Earth-Walk Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Old Stone Monster traveled underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Shuangjing dodged in all directions. At critical moments, he even rolled on the ground, wretched and utterly without the bearing of a noble disciple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“It’s too late!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">A ginseng whisker emerged from underground, and a massive shadow enveloped Shuangjing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">With his Life Hanging by a Thread, Shuangjing hurriedly threw out the “Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings,” struggling to mobilize the army’s strength to block the ginseng whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">As for that “Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings,” it fell from high above and was neatly caught by a stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Shuangjing fled madly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">With the main commander fleeing, the last bit of morale completely collapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Lord Long locked his gaze on Shuangjing and pursued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Void Refinement-level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">This is a Void Refinement-level war treasure!!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
