<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The space within the Formation resembled an enormous vertical shaft, its depths unfathomable, as if plunging straight into the Nine Hells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Within the shaft, yin qi surged like a tide, thick as ink. It was no longer a massive stream of energy, but rather a viscous liquid that churned and roiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Blackwater Mountain White Paper City..." The sight stirred a memory in Ning Zhuo, recalling the name by which the White Paper Immortal City was known to the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The shaft's walls gleamed like polished mirrors, neither stone nor jade, seemingly formed entirely by the Formation's structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The blackwater-like yin qi seethed within the shaft, roaring and crashing. At times, it would surge into towering waves several zhang high, their collisions producing thunderous booms that reverberated through the space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Yang Sanyan, Wen Ruanyu, and Ning Zhuo stood at the edge of the shaft, feeling the bone-chilling cold emanating from the "blackwater." Its frigid temperature surpassed that of ice and snow, piercing straight to the marrow. Their yang qi was suppressed, and even their spiritual energy circulation threatened to freeze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Amidst this raging tide of yin qi, a figure floated serenely - the White Paper City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">She did not drift with the currents, but maintained a state of near-stasis, her bearing exuding supreme dignity as she slowly rose and fell within the turbulent black tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">She had a standard oval face, but her skeletal structure was strikingly defined and robust. Her cheekbones stood high and sharp like chiseled blades, her jawline firm and powerful. Even in sleep, she exuded an air of unquestionable resolve and coldness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Her beauty was like two slender, sharp swords slanting into her hair. Her black eyebrows had already been dusted with a layer of silver-gray, as if coated in frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Her eyes were tightly closed, their shape long and sharp like phoenix eyes. Even shut, the curve of her eyelids resembled meticulously drawn ink strokes, their ends sharply upturned, outlining an air of nobility, arrogance, and scrutiny.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Her lips were thin and clearly defined, originally a fierce cinnabar red but now a lifeless pale purple, like withered wisteria petals. They remained tightly pressed together, maintaining a cold distance that repelled others even in unconsciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Her figure was tall and straight, her skeletal structure balanced. Even lying flat, she radiated an aura of resilience and strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Her long hair spread out, black as obsidian, so dark that not even the Blackwater Yin Tide could dim its luster. At the ends of her hair, the black gradually transitioned into an eerie dark blue. Among the strands, occasional ice-blue crystals of Yin Qi flickered like stars before swiftly disappearing into the dense waves of hair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"City Lord..." Wen Ruanyu sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">After so long, he had finally seen the City Lord's True Form, but the latter was clearly in a dire state, completely unable to awaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yang Sanyan narrowed his eyes. This was his first time seeing the current White Paper Immortal City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Despite his broad experience and cold heart, even he found himself captivated by the City Lord's enchanting beauty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This was while she remained unconscious. One could scarcely imagine what majestic bearing she would exude when her eyes opened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Yin Qi churned in the well like boiling water, its waves crashing with thunderous force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Yet at the very center stood the White Paper City Lord, like a time-preserved amber. Within a few feet of her body, all the raging energy seemed suppressed by an invisible will emanating from her very being, becoming sluggish and slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The White Paper City Lord was like a ten-thousand-year-old shard of black ice thrown into an ink sea. Not only did she fail to melt, but she voraciously assimilated and absorbed this destructive energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Each slow rise and fall of her form seemed like an unconscious breath, drawing in vast quantities of Yin Qi into her body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The exposed skin, now visible through her robes, was mottled with blue-green hues, resembling the flesh of a ghost. Combined with her imposing presence, she seemed like an underworld ruler being paid homage to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The City Lord's Paper Doll Clone sighed deeply. "This is the state of my True Form. To protect the entire White Paper Immortal City, she has absorbed most of the Yin Qi, leaving her unconscious for many years, difficult to revive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Wen Ruanyu examined her intently, his expression grave. "The City Lord was originally a cultivator of the Yang Realm. Her Yang Qi should far exceed her Yin Qi. But now, burdened with excessive Yin Qi, she's teetering on the brink of death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"What can we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Paper Doll Clone shook her head. "I've secretly considered countless methods, but none prove effective. The main issue lies in my True Form's critical state. Any intervention strong enough to disrupt the balance would shatter this fragile condition, leading to immediate death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Yet without such force, how can we hope to combat this mountainous Yin Tide?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">As if finally able to speak after long suppression, the Paper Doll Clone continued her lament: "For years, I've concealed my true situation for the sake of the Immortal City's greater good, sealing my True Form here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Left with no choice, this clone has had to impersonate the original to handle certain matters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Yang Sanyan's brow furrowed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">If the True Form was in such a state, fundamentally unable to be awakened, how could they form a Divine Contract? Even signing with the clone would severely diminish its binding power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The Sect's intelligence was correct," Yang Sanyan mused. "The current White Paper City Lord is a woman of ambition and controlling desires. Despite her precarious position, she's stubbornly clung to power, enduring silently for all these years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">If this truth were exposed, the City Lord's position would face numerous challenges. Her True Form, unable to fight effectively, would make it easy for others to depose her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Yang Sanyan produced the Divine Contract. "City Lord, I never imagined your situation was so dire. If your True Form can't be awakened, this contract will fail to establish even the most basic trust between us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"How can we resolve this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Paper Doll Clone shook her head slowly, a bitter expression on her face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Wen Ruanyu suddenly said, "So that's why the City Lord recruited so many Male Consorts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"It's because her True Form is unconscious. Only through Dual Cultivation with others, where the partner takes the lead, can Yin and Yang merge. This lessens the City Lord's burden of Yin Qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Moreover, Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation embodies profound cosmic principles. Even if Yin Qi were as vast as the sea, it must transform obediently rather than extinguishing the flame with a flood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Paper Doll Clone continued, "Unfortunately, I channeled my body's Yin Qi through the Formation into places like Hidden Yang Manor and Vigorous Yang Manor. Even with all the Male Consorts combined, their efforts are but a drop in the bucket against the total Yin Qi. It's barely enough to maintain my True Form's precarious state."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"The Golden Swallow Trident's Yang Qi, however, isn't suitable for Dual Cultivation. Moreover, it's tainted with Demonic Qi, making it completely unsuitable for my True Form."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"The reason it manifested was merely to give everyone something to cling to, a sliver of hope."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo's emotions surged. He thought of Sun Tiesheng, whose cultivation path had been destroyed by this very situation, forcing him to transform into a half-man, half-demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">If Sun Tiesheng could hear these words, what would he feel?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Sun Tiesheng was already dead, and Shen Bing and Chen Sui had perished because of the Golden Swallow Trident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">If they knew this was all a scheme orchestrated by the City Lord, what would they think?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Even Zheng Shoumo had been deceived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Due to the Golden Swallow Trident's recognition of its master, he had acted repeatedly. His hasty actions revealed flaws, allowing Ning Zhuo to grasp his tail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">To be fair, Ning Zhuo himself had been a driving force behind this development.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Without his and Wen Ruanyu's scheme, they wouldn't have established the Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation at the Vigorous Yang Manor, creating such a grand spectacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"What about Li Xiangshang?" Ning Zhuo's heart stirred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Li Xiangshang had been sent by the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"The White-Haired Dragon Sovereign first sent Jin Yangzi, then added Li Xiangshang. What does he know? What kind of agreement does he have with the White Paper City Lord?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Is Li Xiangshang also a driving force, though he himself doesn't realize it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">As Ning Zhuo considered this, he gained a new understanding of the White Paper Immortal City's bewildering situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The true grand scheme was the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-old conspiracy. Under the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual, the White Paper Immortal City had already been designated as a blood sacrifice site.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"My mother learned of this through Ash Bone Elder, but he didn't inform the White Paper City Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Then does the White Paper City Lord know about this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">On the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's chessboard, the White Paper City Lord was a mere pawn, and the White Paper Immortal City was the flesh he sought to devour.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">On the White Paper City Lord's chessboard, the Golden Swallow Trident served as her tool. Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, Wen Ruanyu, and even Ning Zhuo were her pieces. Sun Tiesheng, Shen Bing, Chen Sui, and other male consorts were her discarded pawns. Li Xiangshang was likely another piece, but whether the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign was one remained uncertain to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"What the mysterious organization is, I'm not yet qualified to know. Only by joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect can I gain further opportunities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"The message left by my mother made me appear as a pawn on the surface, yet secretly gave me the potential to become a chess player."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Yang Sanyan wants the City Lord's True Form to sign a Divine Contract. This is advantageous for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The White Paper City Lord generously supported Ning Zhuo, showing no stinginess in her rewards. Even her sponsorship of the Qing-Jiao Army was marked by grand magnanimity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Any ordinary person would have been thoroughly devoted, offering unwavering loyalty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But Ning Zhuo was no ordinary person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He had clearly seen through the situation and understood the true nature of the White Paper City Lord's character.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Therefore, he decisively chose to stand with the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Is the White Paper City Lord an accomplice of Zheng Shoumo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"This question is crucial!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"If she is, I absolutely won't risk participating in the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">According to Yang Sanyan's account, Ning Zhuo's mother was likely murdered by a mysterious organization. This meant that the message left by Meng Yaoyin was inferior in level to this organization.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">It was even possible that the mysterious organization had already known about the message left by Meng Yaoyin and deliberately preserved it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Having reached this point in his thoughts, Ning Zhuo had grasped the key point: "We must awaken the City Lord's True Form."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">With his thoughts settled, he took decisive action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Immediately, he broke the silence: "To awaken the City Lord, it's actually not difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This single sentence immediately drew the attention of everyone present to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"You have a method?" Yang Sanyan asked curiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo clasped his hands, his face solemn as he declared with grave importance, "To inform you all, I possess some medical knowledge. I have a technique that can resolve the City Lord's True Form's current predicament."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Yang Sanyan nodded decisively. "Then please demonstrate this technique, young man."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Wen Ruanyu watched with anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Paper Doll Clone murmured, "Very well, but I must supervise the entire process closely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Of course," Ning Zhuo replied with a smile. "This medical art of mine permits external observation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Proceed," the Paper Doll Clone gestured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">She activated the Formation, allowing the Blackwater Yin Tide to lift the City Lord's True Form, slowly raising it to the well's edge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo stood before the City Lord's True Form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">As he approached, he realized the City Lord's stature was imposing - nearly three meters tall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He reached out decisively, drawing closer to the City Lord's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">When his palm was still a meter away, he felt as if it had been pricked by needles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The City Lord's True Form contained terrifyingly vast reserves of Yin Qi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Any ordinary Nascent Soul Cultivator would have perished. Only the White Paper Immortal City Lord, relying on her innate talent, could have achieved such an extraordinary state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo wisely halted, maintaining a three-foot distance as he positioned his palm toward the City Lord's True Form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Paper Doll Clone, Yang Sanyan, and Wen Ruanyu watched intently, their eyes fixed on Ning Zhuo's movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">To the surprise of all three observers, Ning Zhuo didn't activate any medical techniques. Instead, he directly expelled a stream of Yang Qi from his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Paper Doll Clone's expression immediately turned disappointed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">She had expected Ning Zhuo to perform some mystical medical art, but instead, he was simply employing the old Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Ning Zhuo is merely at the Foundation Establishment stage. While his combat strength is formidable, he's still too young. How much Yang Qi could he possibly possess?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Hm?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">In the next instant, the Paper Doll Clone's expression changed dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">She watched in astonishment as the Yang Qi surged forth. Without needing Ning Zhuo's control or his participation in the dual cultivation, it flowed directly into the White Paper Immortal City Lord's True Form, like a fledgling returning to its nest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">As this happened, the Yang Qi rapidly merged with the Yin Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The fusion occurred with astonishing speed and efficiency, achieving perfect harmony!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Noticing this, Yang Sanyan and Wen Ruanyu also showed expressions of surprise, their regard for Ning Zhuo growing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"How strange! What kind of method is this? The condensed Yang Qi is so closely aligned with the True Form, it's practically indistinguishable from it itself!" the City Lord Clone marveled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Wen Ruanyu nodded in admiration. "Though Young Master Ning Zhuo's cultivation level is low, his methods are extraordinary. He continually surpasses expectations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Yang Sanyan remarked, "Rather than calling it medical art, it's more akin to dual cultivation, isn't it? I never imagined you'd be so skilled in dual cultivation, Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Ahem." Ning Zhuo coughed repeatedly. "How can you call this dual cultivation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Only the exchange of Primordial Yang and Primordial Yin constitutes true dual cultivation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"This level of cultivation is merely me producing some resources for the City Lord's use."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Senior Yang, I intend to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect in the future. I'm still young - please don't ruin my reputation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Yang Sanyan blinked. "This technique of yours is truly profound! It seems capable of refining your Yang Qi to perfectly match any individual."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Remarkable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"If exposed, countless female cultivators would seek to dual cultivate with you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo coughed twice. "This method drains my reserves. It mustn't be overused or relied upon regularly. Circumstances forced my hand today. I implore everyone present to keep this secret!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"I won't breathe a word," Yang Sanyan said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Wen Ruanyu added, "A gentleman keeps his lips sealed tighter than a bottle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The Paper Doll Clone spoke, "Truly worthy of being our Immortal City's savior. Young Master Ning Zhuo, your methods are consistently astonishing. Ah, to think you've depleted your reserves for this - your compensation will be substantial! I urge you to continue these efforts. Saving my True Form means saving all of White Paper City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, acting as if he'd exhausted all his strength. Secretly, he activated the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, manipulating his blood qi to rapidly drain his complexion of color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">In truth, the Yang Qi he'd expelled came from the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle. It was essentially transformed Yin Qi from the White Paper Immortal City Lord, having little to do with him personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Moments later, the real White Paper City Lord's eyelids fluttered open. Her first gaze fell upon the large-headed youth she'd been dual cultivating with.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
