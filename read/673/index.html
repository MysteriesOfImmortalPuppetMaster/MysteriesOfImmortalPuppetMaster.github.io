<paragraph index="1">Boulder Cave Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Yu Heye sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, cultivating in stillness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Suddenly, his skin shimmered with a five-colored aura, fluctuating erratically between crimson, yellow, azure, white, and black. His breathing grew wildly unstable, alternating between violent surges and feeble gasps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">His brow furrowed deeply, sweat pouring down his face as he clenched his teeth, desperately trying to stabilize the chaotic spiritual energy within his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Finally, his perseverance paid off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">With a muffled groan, he spat out a mouthful of blood, slowly opened his eyes, and exhaled a turbid breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After a long period of adjusting his breathing, a voice reported from outside the door, "Master, the matter has been settled. The newcomer chose twelve mid-grade spirit stones and, under my supervision, immediately vacated Stone Spring Cave Residence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Hmm," Yu Heye replied, forcing himself to sound composed as he nodded slightly. "The Flying Cloud Assembly is approaching, and similar situations may arise. You are responsible for this matter. Ensure no unnecessary individuals rent Cave Residences here. I require absolute tranquility!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Understood, Master," the Foundation Establishment cultivator replied, his footsteps fading as he departed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Only then did Yu Heye exhale another turbid breath, his entire body collapsing into exhaustion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Yu Heye couldn't care less about the identity of the newcomer he had ordered to be evicted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The fact that they had rented a Cave Residence here meant they lacked connections within the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Besides, what power could a mere Foundation Establishment youth possess?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">True, there were Foundation Establishment prodigies capable of battling Golden Core cultivators across realms. But what were the chances of encountering such a genius?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The possibility was vanishingly slim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Moreover, would a true prodigy cultivator stoop so easily for just twelve mid-grade spirit stones?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">For most cultivators, moving out of their Cave Residence would earn them a tidy sum - a win-win situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yu Heye quickly dismissed this trivial matter from his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Drunken Immortal Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Top-floor private room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The round table, crafted from millennia-old koi-patterned wood, gleamed like polished jade, emitting a subtle, calming fragrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Shen Xi sat upright in the main seat, his slender fingers unconsciously tracing the rim of his warm jade cup. His cousin, Su Lingkou, gazed out the window, her bright eyes captivated by the swarm of Flying Shuttles racing through the night sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">It was night, and these Flying Shuttles, each carrying a cultivator, blazed with vibrant, multicolored light as they weaved through the mountain peaks with remarkable agility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Across from them sat a young cultivator, Lin Jinglong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He wore a deep azure robe trimmed with gold thread. His sharply defined features framed eyes that were both serene and profound, like a hidden valley shrouded in ancient forests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Lin Jinglong glanced out the window and smiled. "I remember Brother Situ used to love these races. Every time, his Flying Shuttle would streak ahead like a shooting star across the night sky."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Shen Xi's memories were stirred as well. "If we calculate the timing, Brother Situ should be arriving soon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"I exchanged Flying Messages with Fellow Daoist Situ while I was in Nine Palaces Immortal City, discussing our alliance. Since you were in secluded cultivation at the time, we can discuss the details now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Lin Jinglong nodded, anticipating Shen Xi's next words. "The Flying Cloud Assembly will be a gathering of extraordinary talents. Every cultivator in the Flying Cloud Kingdom with the ambition and ability will converge here, vying for a high-ranking position and the chance to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"While the three of us possess exceptional talent and stand out among our peers, facing this challenge alone would be risky."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"An alliance is inevitable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Shen Xi smiled, Lin Jinglong's response was exactly as he had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Su Lingkou withdrew her gaze and smoothly complimented Lin Jinglong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Lin Jinglong picked up his jade cup and took a delicate sip of Spirit Tea. "To achieve our goals, gathering momentum is paramount. You, I, and Situ Xing can serve as the core. However, we still need more allies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"After all, the tasks at the Flying Cloud Assembly are the Myriad Manifestations Sect's accumulated backlog - a bewildering variety of challenges. Uniting more talents will increase our chances of resolving the most tasks quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"On my journey north, I brought twenty-eight reliable individuals. Among them are three late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, five mid-stage, and eight early-stage. The rest are elite peak Qi Refining experts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Shen Xi leaned back in his chair and glanced at Su Lingkou beside him. "Lingkou is my closest kin and wishes to remain by my side. I didn't bring anyone else."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Lin Jinglong nodded. "Every family has its own burdens. The Shen Clan truly needs to maintain a strong presence in Nine Palaces Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Shen Xi tapped his fingertip lightly on the smooth tabletop. "However, I've already identified a promising talent. His name is Ning Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Just then, the door to the private room slid open silently, and a young man with an air of aloofness stepped inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">His silver hair cascaded like a waterfall, and his deep blue robes shimmered with starlight. With a high-bridged nose and slender eyes, he greeted, "Brother Shen, Brother Lin, I apologize for the wait."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Shen Xi nodded, his smile radiant. "It's good to see you, Brother Situ."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">After Situ Xing took his seat, he asked, "I overheard you mentioning Ning Zhuo outside the door just now. What's the matter?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Ever since you sent me that Flying Message, praising his potential and suggesting we invite him to join us, I've had him investigated," Shen Xi explained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Just this evening, after he rented a Cave Residence, he was immediately driven out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Oh?" A flicker of surprise crossed Shen Xi's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Situ Xing continued, "Yu Heye, the Golden Core cultivator of Boulder Cave Residence, has been building his faction for years in preparation for the upcoming Flying Cloud Assembly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"He's been forcing out cultivators who rented Cave Residences near his own. Ning Zhuo is just the latest example."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Yu Heye sent someone to give Ning Zhuo ten mid-grade spirit stones, and he obediently moved out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"How can someone with such a temperament be considered our equal?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Lin Jinglong remained silent, turning his gaze to Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Shen Xi's brow furrowed slightly. This news had caught him off guard, and he fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Su Lingkou quickly shook her Magic Artifact bell, prompting, "Waiter, bring the dishes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Several attendants immediately filed in, breaking the awkward tension as they presented a series of exquisite delicacies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">First came the Golden Feather Sparrow Tongue Soup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">In a delicate white porcelain bowl, the broth shimmered a clear, golden hue, like melted sunlight. The tender sparrow tongues floated within, their jade-like texture radiating a fragrance that instantly invigorated the spiritual energy within one's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Next was the Ice Soul Silver Scale Fish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">This rare spiritual fish, sourced from the depths of a ten-thousand-foot-deep frozen pool, boasted shimmering silver scales. It had been instantly frozen at its peak freshness using a supreme ice-type Spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The fish rested on a bed of century-old Profound Ice, its translucent slices as thin as cicada wings. A frosty mist swirled around the dish, as if ice crystals were flowing through the fish's delicate marbling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Finally, there was the Rainbow Essence Spirit Treasure Rice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The spiritual rice itself came in three vibrant colors - crimson sunset rice, obsidian jade rice, and azure cloud rice - each grain plump and lustrous like a precious pearl. Steamed in a specially crafted Spirit Cauldron using dozens of Spirit Spring waters and infused with the vapor from high-grade Spirit Stones, the distinct grains radiated a vibrant, ethereal glow, as if tangible rainbow mist swirled around them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Lin Jinglong savored the Rainbow Essence Spirit Treasure Rice. The Spirit Food released a gentle yet immense and continuous stream of spiritual energy. After a long moment, he sighed sincerely, "As expected of the Drunken Immortal Pavilion. Spirit Food of this caliber can only be sustained by the top sects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Su Lingkou raved about the Golden Feather Sparrow Tongue Soup, "It melts in your mouth, transforms thoughts into birds, and sharpens divine sense like lightning - truly extraordinary!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Situ Xing devoured the most Ice Soul Fish Slices. Each slice, as soon as it touched his tongue, exploded with an intense sweetness and icy chill, delivering a refreshing, invigorating sensation while simultaneously enhancing the foundation of his Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Ice Soul Silver Fish - cold yet nourishing! This dish has increased my Human Soul's lifespan by fifteen years!" Situ Xing exclaimed, turning to Shen Xi. "Brother Shen, you've truly outdone yourself this time. Ha ha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Shen Xi smiled politely, offering a few courteous remarks before returning to the topic of Ning Zhuo. He reiterated his belief that there might be hidden circumstances surrounding the matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Situ Xing sneered coldly. "Brother Shen, you know my nature. I despise stupidity above all else and hold utter contempt for the weak who lack self-awareness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"I achieved Qi Induction at seven, drawing starlight with every breath. By nine, I had broken through the third layer of Qi Refining - while mediocre talents were still struggling to identify their meridians."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I mastered the supreme cultivation art, the Divine Sea Star Sword Art, and forged my Dao Foundation in just one hundred and forty days."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"By night, I observed the Stellar Tracks; by day, I refined my spiritual essence. By the age of sixteen, my divine Qi had merged, and the precious elixir in my Middle Dantian erupted like a celestial river!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"At twenty-one, my divine sea spontaneously manifested the Divine Intent Star Guiding Talisman. Now, at twenty-eight, I have already formed a Void Core."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Situ Xing's gaze swept over Su Lingkou, pausing briefly on the faces of Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong. "Only the strong deserve to stand beside me! Only the elite are worthy to walk with me. Those with flawed character, those who are nothing but insignificant fish, should not presume to cling to me and provoke my disgust."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Shen Xi remained silent, the atmosphere growing awkward once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This time, Su Lingkou also felt Situ Xing's contempt, and a flicker of anger crossed her face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Lin Jinglong, noticing the tension, chuckled wryly and interjected, "Brother Situ speaks truly. Ning Zhuo's retreat does indeed reveal weakness. However, Yu Heye... he is no ordinary Golden Core cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"A late-stage Golden Core cultivator, Yu Heye specializes in the Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art and possesses exceptional combat prowess. For a time, he was widely considered the most promising candidate to become the sect's True Inheritor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Now, with his lifespan nearing its end, he has been accumulating power, waiting for this Flying Cloud Assembly to seize his final opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Ning Zhuo is merely at the Foundation Establishment stage. Facing such an ancient monster who relies on overwhelming force and spirit stones rather than a life-or-death struggle, choosing to temporarily withdraw... is perfectly reasonable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Situ Xing snorted coldly. "Golden Core? Reverse Five Elements Demonic Art? If he dares to seize what's mine, I'll draw my sword! Even if I can't win, I'll test the mettle of this Golden Core cultivator! I'll show him that Foundation Establishment cultivators aren't pushovers!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Without such courage and ferocity, how can one compete in the Flying Cloud Assembly, a true battlefield? How can he deserve Brother Shen's special attention, or be worthy of joining our ranks?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Shen Xi shook his head. "Brother Situ remains as bold and sharp as ever. But forgive my bluntness - how many Foundation Establishment cultivators can truly face a late-stage Golden Core cultivator head-on?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Those who can achieve such a feat, like the three of us, are all blessed by heaven and earth, one in ten thousand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Lin Jinglong nodded. "Nine Palaces Immortal City is one of the top five major cities in the Flying Cloud Kingdom. Yet in the past sixty years, only Brother Shen Xi has emerged as a genius capable of directly confronting Golden Core cultivators during the Foundation Establishment Stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Cultivators like us are indeed as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Situ Xing snorted again, ceasing his rebuttal. "Suit yourselves. But anyone I deem worthy would never resort to such cowardly tactics!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"There's more," Situ Xing continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Even though the three of us are working together, we still need to establish a hierarchy and order of precedence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"My suggestion is this: after we finish this meal, we should head to the Martial Arts Hall tonight and have a proper competition!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong's attention was immediately drawn to this proposal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Both of them had long been eager for battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The three of them sparred until dawn the next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">As they parted ways, Lin Jinglong reminded them, "According to the established customs of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, in addition to recruiting followers, we must also establish a mountain stronghold and claim all the Cave Residences on its peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Only by demonstrating such power can we attract others to join us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"That's exactly what Yu Heye did."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Situ Xing nodded. "I'll scout for a suitable mountain and send a Flying Message as soon as I find one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Having secured first place in the competition, Situ Xing was in high spirits. His sword flashed like starlight, piercing the Void as he vanished in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Lin Jinglong and Shen Xi exchanged farewells with clasped hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Su Lingkou hooked her arm through her cousin's, grumbling, "You clearly let Brother Situ win! Does he really think he earned first place? Hmph!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Shen Xi shook his head. "His raw combat power is indeed exceptional. If I were to fully unleash my strength, I would need to prepare an array beforehand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Losing to him was part of my plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"I intended to use him as a sharp sword to cut through thorns and ride the wind and waves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"It wasn't just me. Lin Jinglong had the same intention. I could sense he was holding back too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Su Lingkou's eyes lit up slightly. "So, Cousin, your draw with Lin Jinglong was also deliberate?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Shen Xi frowned slightly, sighed, and admitted, "Neither of us wanted the leader's position, but we were both interested in the second-in-command role."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"As the competition progressed, we realized we'd have to reveal our trump cards to secure victory. But that would have gone too far."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"So, Brother Lin and I simultaneously withdrew, without even discussing it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">At that moment, a Flying Message drifted down and landed in Shen Xi's hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Shen Xi read the message, smiled faintly, and handed it to Su Lingkou. "Let's go meet Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Su Lingkou glanced at the message, which only contained Ning Zhuo's current location, and asked, puzzled, "Cousin, why do we need to meet this outsider? Situ Xing has already made it clear he dislikes Ning Zhuo. Why risk damaging our relationship with Situ Xing just to recruit an outsider?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"After all, he's our leader now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"I don't think Ning Zhuo is the type to back down easily," Shen Xi said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"And do you really believe Situ Xing's immediate criticism of Ning Zhuo was solely because he disapproved of Ning Zhuo's retreat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Huh?" Su Lingkou replied, puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Shen Xi's gaze turned enigmatic. "He was using Ning Zhuo as a means to undermine my authority. After all, in our last confrontation, he failed to breach my Besieged City Formation by the agreed-upon time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"If I abandon Ning Zhuo now, it would only give him further justification to suppress me within this temporary alliance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Su Lingkou let out another "Ah," her anxiety growing. "Then what should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Shen Xi smiled faintly. "Let's go. Perhaps we can offer our friend a little help."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">After Shen Xi's explanation, Su Lingkou finally understood the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Wherever there are people, there will be power struggles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Even alliances between friends have their hierarchies. Moreover, the relationship between Shen Xi, Lin, and Situ Xing had always been primarily competitive, with friendship as a secondary consideration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo had now become a crucial pawn in the power game between Situ Xing and Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Sigh," Su Lingkou said worriedly, "I hope Ning Zhuo can pull himself together."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
