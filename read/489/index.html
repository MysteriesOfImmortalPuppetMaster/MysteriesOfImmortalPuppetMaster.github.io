<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The first official troop training exercise successfully formed a battle formation, which made Sun and Ning feel delighted.<br/>
<br/>
“The speed at which the battle formation is formed could still be faster!”<br/>
<br/>
“Indeed. We also need greater stability. After all, the pressure we’ll face on the battlefield will far exceed what we have now.”<br/>
<br/>
The two discussed that from now on, their main focus in cultivation would shift to troop training.<br/>
<br/>
Troop training did not consume much individual spiritual energy, but it consumed a great deal of mental power.<br/>
<br/>
In this regard, they needed to supplement with corresponding pills and spiritual food, which could extend their training time.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest consumption was spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
Each puppet soldier carried spirit stones within it. Often, after one troop training session, the puppet soldiers’ spirit stones would be completely spent or nearly depleted.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Ning Zhuo was well-off now. In the past, he would not have been able to sustain even two or three sessions of troop training.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi, who came after hearing about it, also watched one troop-training session of the puppet army. Learning the amount of spirit stones expended, he could not help exclaiming, “This is truly extravagant!”<br/>
<br/>
Although Mu Lan no longer observed the training on-site, she continued to monitor their progress.<br/>
<br/>
As the days passed, Sun and Ning Zhuo’s maneuvering techniques grew ever more proficient.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan’s internal assessment of the puppet army’s combat strength steadily rose as well. Initially, she had seen them as a burden, then barely acceptable, then just passable, and finally somewhat reliable…<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not stop his own cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
He rotated among the Mirror Platform Spirit-Conjoining Sutra, the Five Elements Vital Energy Formula, and the Demonic Blood Tendon Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, by using four bricks of national power, he saved himself nine years of hard work and managed to achieve fully opened dantians, entering the stage where precious medicines sprouted within.<br/>
<br/>
At this stage, he did not need to integrate his three treasures, nor did he have to make his essence, qi, and spirit pull one another into the other two dantians, so they could achieve a realm of mutual interconnection.<br/>
<br/>
Because of that, he spent slightly less time on cultivation than before.<br/>
<br/>
What troubled Ning Zhuo the most was no longer his cultivation speed. Battle merits and national power bricks had become the shortcut he searched for.<br/>
<br/>
He now worried about repairs for the puppet soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
During training, he and Sun Lingtong only damaged two or three of them.<br/>
<br/>
“But in a real battle, I’d have to rely on Deadly Sacrifice of Comrades… oh, I mean the Hero’s Return Technique.”<br/>
<br/>
“That would demand the sacrifice of many puppet soldiers.”<br/>
<br/>
“So, after every real battle, puppet soldiers would be heavily damaged, and they would need timely replenishment.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Ten thousand Li Traversing Dragon could be refitted with a few repair bays, but…”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo planned ahead, aware of this current shortcoming.<br/>
<br/>
“I need to stockpile a large amount of materials and buy some puppet workstations.”<br/>
<br/>
There were many such stations in the Molten Lava Immortal Palace. These workstations could mass-produce a certain puppet component at high speed, or specialize in a particular operation, such as high-force crushing or precise cutting. They were the basic facilities for repairing and manufacturing puppet constructs.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took the initiative to seek these out on the market and actively made purchases.<br/>
<br/>
“Auction?”<br/>
<br/>
In one shop, Ning Zhuo heard a piece of news from the shopkeeper.<br/>
<br/>
After following up, Ning Zhuo learned more details.<br/>
<br/>
Although the auction was not large, it was quite high in caliber, specifically catering to cultivators who were about to go to war. It was personally led by the City Lord of Green Forest Immortal City, along with many major merchants in the city, and it had official permission from two major national authorities, who provided many fine items through official channels.<br/>
<br/>
This meant that, for Ning Zhuo, participating held no small significance.<br/>
<br/>
The shopkeeper reminded him, “My lord strategist, attending this auction won’t be easy. You need a letter of recommendation. As far as I know, the only extra letters are with the City Lord.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately understood the implication. This was how the City Lord intended to rake in money before the auction even began, through collecting large sums from people who wanted those letters.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not plan to contact the City Lord of Green Forest Immortal City directly.<br/>
<br/>
First, he found Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang to discuss the matter. The three of them knew even less than he did; it was their first time hearing about it.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then went to Mu Lan.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan nodded. “Yes, there is such a thing.”<br/>
<br/>
She did not show much interest.<br/>
<br/>
It was not that she was busy with troop training. She simply had no money.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that Ning Zhuo wanted to go, she directly handed the letter of recommendation to him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo expressed his thanks and politely invited Mu Lan to attend with him.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan nodded and immediately agreed.<br/>
<br/>
The auction took place in the City Lord’s mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Late at night, the main hall was brightly lit.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan, Ning Zhuo, Shuang Jing, Xu Dali, Sun Gan, and others all entered.<br/>
<br/>
The City Lord of Green Forest Immortal City was tall and thin, with a goatee and high cheekbones. Presiding in person, he said, “Everyone, today’s little auction has many treasures that will help you shine on the battlefield or save your life.”<br/>
<br/>
“To be frank, I started planning and gathering items six months ago to prepare for this event.”<br/>
<br/>
“I trust you will not be disappointed!”<br/>
<br/>
“All right, let the auction begin.”<br/>
<br/>
The City Lord stepped down from the stage. A Nascent Soul–level cultivator went up to host.<br/>
<br/>
Two attendants carried a large wooden crate onto the auction platform.<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul cultivator hosting gently tapped the crate, opening it.<br/>
<br/>
Before everyone’s eyes lay a crate of Thunder Pearls.<br/>
<br/>
“These are Earth-Fissure Thunder Pearls. With just a bit of spiritual energy poured in as a fuse, you can throw them to detonate.”<br/>
<br/>
“They were refined by a cultivator who specializes in the earth element. When these Thunder Pearls explode, they can tear open the ground—especially useful for breaking through hard mountains and rocks.”<br/>
<br/>
“There are four thousand of them in this crate!”<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul cultivator announced the price, and many responded at once.<br/>
<br/>
In the coming great war, mountain battles would be common, so these Thunder Pearls would have ample opportunity to show their power.<br/>
<br/>
The Earth-Fissure Thunder Pearls were quickly bought.<br/>
<br/>
The second item was a flying sword named Sky One. Its offensive and defensive capabilities were both low, but its speed was extremely fast.<br/>
<br/>
The flying sword likewise sold at a high price.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo saw that the buyer of the flying sword was an acquaintance —Shuang Jing of the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, Shuang Jing bought Sky One as a contingency for the future. If his army was defeated, he would have another means of escape.<br/>
<br/>
Although he already had many such backup plans, one more would not hurt.<br/>
<br/>
The third item was a piece of battle armor called Black Tortoise Great Armor.<br/>
<br/>
This armor looked very heavy, evidently designed for body cultivators, and it was bought by Xu Dali.<br/>
<br/>
When the fourth item appeared, the attendants led up a cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
This cultivator’s figure was as slender as a willow branch. She was slim and graceful, with light steps. Her face was like congealed cream, her skin mottled with colors. Her pupils were huge, taking up nearly a third of her face, and her gaze was calm.<br/>
<br/>
Her hair was brightly colored, layered in intricate patterns. Her clothing was woven from vines and petals in a softly hued violet-red, adorned with tiny flowers.<br/>
<br/>
She stood only half the height of a normal person, reminding Ning Zhuo of Hua Guzi.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi was only half-human, half-demon, while this female cultivator was entirely a demon cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
“Everyone has likely noticed that this is an Azalea Flower Demon.”<br/>
<br/>
“She was nurtured by the Demon-Soldier Pavilion into a Flower Demon Daobing. She can heal injuries and also possesses some measure of blood-sacrifice power.”<br/>
<br/>
As he spoke, the auction host commanded the Azalea Flower Demon Daobing to display her healing technique in front of everyone.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth lot consisted of these eighty Azalea Flower Demon Daobing.<br/>
<br/>
Where there was war, there would be wounded. If one could have such a group of Daobing serving as healers, they could promptly treat injuries and return soldiers to the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Several of the generals present looked on with shining eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Once the bidding began, Mu Lan, uncharacteristically, took part.<br/>
<br/>
She was the first to be outbid.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali was the second.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan and Shuang Jing were locked in fierce competition.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the price climb higher and higher, the time between Sun Gan’s and Shuang Jing’s bids grew longer as they deliberated.<br/>
<br/>
When everyone thought the two of them were close to a decisive outcome, Ning Zhuo suddenly spoke up and offered double the current price.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, all eyes turned to him.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan and Shuang Jing glared, fixing Ning Zhuo with sharp looks.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo showed no malice. He stood up and cupped his hands with a polite smile, bowing courteously to the entire audience.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan and Shuang Jing both gave cold snorts and withdrew from the bidding.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo obtained this group of Daobing and immediately gave them to Mu Lan.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan opened her mouth slightly, seemingly intending to refuse on instinct.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sent her a message by divine sense: “Take them, General Mu. Without your letter of recommendation, I wouldn’t even be here at this auction.”<br/>
<br/>
“I know Red Flower Camp has taken heavy losses. This batch of Daobing is from the Demon-Soldier Pavilion and is well-trained. You can put them to use right away—just what you need to fill your manpower gap.”<br/>
<br/>
“They should be very compatible with the Red Flower Formation.”<br/>
<br/>
“Red Flower Camp desperately needs medics. Don’t overwork Lord Zhang Zhongyi.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s persuasion struck home. Mu Lan nodded slightly, replying in a complex voice through divine sense, “Thank you.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo waved a hand as if to say it was just a small gesture, a trivial gift—no need for formality.<br/>
<br/>
After six more lots were sold, Ning Zhuo finally saw what he had been waiting for.<br/>
<br/>
A puppet workstation—an Ingenious Hand Cabinet.<br/>
<br/>
“This is a Nascent Soul–level puppet workstation…”<br/>
<br/>
After a brief introduction, the host concluded, “The asking price is 1,080,000 mid-grade spirit stones.”<br/>
<br/>
“Two million!” Ning Zhuo was the first to bid.<br/>
<br/>
The hall went silent.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone slightly interested in it gave up upon hearing that bold offer.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Ning Zhuo thought he had it secured, a light, airy female voice spoke: “Two million and one hundred thousand.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo raised the bid again: “Two million two hundred thousand.”<br/>
<br/>
She said, “Two million two hundred and one thousand.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned and continued: “Two million six hundred thousand.”<br/>
<br/>
She chuckled. “Three million.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo kept going: “Three million six hundred thousand!”<br/>
<br/>
She laughed out loud: “Six million!!”<br/>
<br/>
All at once, the entire hall focused on her.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked over and saw a female cultivator wearing a mask. Her right arm was replaced by a puppet limb.<br/>
<br/>
Her ash-white hair revealed her advanced age.<br/>
<br/>
The masked woman turned slightly, looking at Ning Zhuo. “Boy, where’s your family?”<br/>
<br/>
She seemed to be asking a question, but in truth it was full of insult and provocation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s face sank. “May I ask for your name?”<br/>
<br/>
The masked woman tilted her chin. “Shuang Ling.”<br/>
<br/>
All the cultivators present were shocked —Machinery Princess!<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing gave a bitter laugh, stood, and bowed deeply before everyone. “Aunt, you’ve come to join the war as well?”<br/>
<br/>
Machinery Princess Shuang Ling gave a cold snort. “If you’d performed even slightly better in that ambush, I wouldn’t have needed to come all this way to reinforce you.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing hastily bowed again. “It was my fault. I failed in battle!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling snorted once more. “Failing in battle is one thing, but to think you even let someone else snatch your bride from you.”<br/>
<br/>
She turned to Ning Zhuo. “The future successor of the Grand Marshal’s house —Mu Lan. And her husband is only a Foundation Establishment cultivator?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan both looked taken aback.<br/>
<br/>
The entire crowd burst into an uproar.<br/>
<br/>
“What? What’s going on?!”<br/>
<br/>
“How could General Mu Lan already have a husband?”<br/>
<br/>
“Is it Ning Zhuo? Seems it’s referring to him. What in the world happened?!”<br/>
<br/>
“Impossible! That’s impossible. How could the Tiger Daughter of the Grand Marshal’s house be married already?!”</div>
