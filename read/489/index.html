<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 489: Husband and Wife Relationship Exposed</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The first official troop training exercise successfully formed a battle formation, which made Sun and Ning feel delighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“The speed at which the battle formation is formed could still be faster!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Indeed. We also need greater stability. After all, the pressure we’ll face on the battlefield will far exceed what we have now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The two discussed that from now on, their main focus in cultivation would shift to troop training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Troop training did not consume much individual spiritual energy, but it consumed a great deal of mental power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In this regard, they needed to supplement with corresponding pills and spiritual food, which could extend their training time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The greatest consumption was spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Each puppet soldier carried spirit stones within it. Often, after one troop training session, the puppet soldiers’ spirit stones would be completely spent or nearly depleted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Fortunately, Ning Zhuo was well-off now. In the past, he would not have been able to sustain even two or three sessions of troop training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhang Zhongyi, who came after hearing about it, also watched one troop-training session of the puppet army. Learning the amount of spirit stones expended, he could not help exclaiming, “This is truly extravagant!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Although Mu Lan no longer observed the training on-site, she continued to monitor their progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">As the days passed, Sun and Ning Zhuo’s maneuvering techniques grew ever more proficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Mu Lan’s internal assessment of the puppet army’s combat strength steadily rose as well. Initially, she had seen them as a burden, then barely acceptable, then just passable, and finally somewhat reliable…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo did not stop his own cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He rotated among the Mirror Platform Spirit-Conjoining Sutra, the Five Elements Vital Energy Formula, and the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Previously, by using four bricks of national power, he saved himself nine years of hard work and managed to achieve fully opened dantians, entering the stage where precious medicines sprouted within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">At this stage, he did not need to integrate his three treasures, nor did he have to make his essence, qi, and spirit pull one another into the other two dantians, so they could achieve a realm of mutual interconnection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Because of that, he spent slightly less time on cultivation than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">What troubled Ning Zhuo the most was no longer his cultivation speed. Battle merits and national power bricks had become the shortcut he searched for.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He now worried about repairs for the puppet soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">During training, he and Sun Lingtong only damaged two or three of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“But in a real battle, I’d have to rely on Deadly Sacrifice of Comrades… oh, I mean the Hero’s Return Technique.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“That would demand the sacrifice of many puppet soldiers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“So, after every real battle, puppet soldiers would be heavily damaged, and they would need timely replenishment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“The Ten thousand Li Traversing Dragon could be refitted with a few repair bays, but…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo planned ahead, aware of this current shortcoming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“I need to stockpile a large amount of materials and buy some puppet workstations.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">There were many such stations in the Molten Lava Immortal Palace. These workstations could mass-produce a certain puppet component at high speed, or specialize in a particular operation, such as high-force crushing or precise cutting. They were the basic facilities for repairing and manufacturing puppet constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo took the initiative to seek these out on the market and actively made purchases.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Auction?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In one shop, Ning Zhuo heard a piece of news from the shopkeeper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">After following up, Ning Zhuo learned more details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Although the auction was not large, it was quite high in caliber, specifically catering to cultivators who were about to go to war. It was personally led by the City Lord of Green Forest Immortal City, along with many major merchants in the city, and it had official permission from two major national authorities, who provided many fine items through official channels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">This meant that, for Ning Zhuo, participating held no small significance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The shopkeeper reminded him, “My lord strategist, attending this auction won’t be easy. You need a letter of recommendation. As far as I know, the only extra letters are with the City Lord.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo immediately understood the implication. This was how the City Lord intended to rake in money before the auction even began, through collecting large sums from people who wanted those letters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo did not plan to contact the City Lord of Green Forest Immortal City directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">First, he found Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang to discuss the matter. The three of them knew even less than he did; it was their first time hearing about it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo then went to Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Mu Lan nodded. “Yes, there is such a thing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">She did not show much interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">It was not that she was busy with troop training. She simply had no money.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Seeing that Ning Zhuo wanted to go, she directly handed the letter of recommendation to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo expressed his thanks and politely invited Mu Lan to attend with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Mu Lan nodded and immediately agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The auction took place in the City Lord’s mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Late at night, the main hall was brightly lit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Mu Lan, Ning Zhuo, Shuang Jing, Xu Dali, Sun Gan, and others all entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The City Lord of Green Forest Immortal City was tall and thin, with a goatee and high cheekbones. Presiding in person, he said, “Everyone, today’s little auction has many treasures that will help you shine on the battlefield or save your life.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“To be frank, I started planning and gathering items six months ago to prepare for this event.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“I trust you will not be disappointed!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“All right, let the auction begin.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The City Lord stepped down from the stage. A Nascent Soul–level cultivator went up to host.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Two attendants carried a large wooden crate onto the auction platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Nascent Soul cultivator hosting gently tapped the crate, opening it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Before everyone’s eyes lay a crate of Thunder Pearls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“These are Earth-Fissure Thunder Pearls. With just a bit of spiritual energy poured in as a fuse, you can throw them to detonate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“They were refined by a cultivator who specializes in the earth element. When these Thunder Pearls explode, they can tear open the ground—especially useful for breaking through hard mountains and rocks.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“There are four thousand of them in this crate!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Nascent Soul cultivator announced the price, and many responded at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">In the coming great war, mountain battles would be common, so these Thunder Pearls would have ample opportunity to show their power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Earth-Fissure Thunder Pearls were quickly bought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The second item was a flying sword named Sky One. Its offensive and defensive capabilities were both low, but its speed was extremely fast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The flying sword likewise sold at a high price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo saw that the buyer of the flying sword was an acquaintance —Shuang Jing of the White Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Clearly, Shuang Jing bought Sky One as a contingency for the future. If his army was defeated, he would have another means of escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Although he already had many such backup plans, one more would not hurt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The third item was a piece of battle armor called Black Tortoise Great Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This armor looked very heavy, evidently designed for body cultivators, and it was bought by Xu Dali.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">When the fourth item appeared, the attendants led up a cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">This cultivator’s figure was as slender as a willow branch. She was slim and graceful, with light steps. Her face was like congealed cream, her skin mottled with colors. Her pupils were huge, taking up nearly a third of her face, and her gaze was calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Her hair was brightly colored, layered in intricate patterns. Her clothing was woven from vines and petals in a softly hued violet-red, adorned with tiny flowers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">She stood only half the height of a normal person, reminding Ning Zhuo of Hua Guzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Hua Guzi was only half-human, half-demon, while this female cultivator was entirely a demon cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Everyone has likely noticed that this is an Azalea Flower Demon.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“She was nurtured by the Demon-Soldier Pavilion into a Flower Demon Daobing. She can heal injuries and also possesses some measure of blood-sacrifice power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">As he spoke, the auction host commanded the Azalea Flower Demon Daobing to display her healing technique in front of everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The fourth lot consisted of these eighty Azalea Flower Demon Daobing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Where there was war, there would be wounded. If one could have such a group of Daobing serving as healers, they could promptly treat injuries and return soldiers to the fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Several of the generals present looked on with shining eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Once the bidding began, Mu Lan, uncharacteristically, took part.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">She was the first to be outbid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Xu Dali was the second.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Sun Gan and Shuang Jing were locked in fierce competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Seeing the price climb higher and higher, the time between Sun Gan’s and Shuang Jing’s bids grew longer as they deliberated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">When everyone thought the two of them were close to a decisive outcome, Ning Zhuo suddenly spoke up and offered double the current price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">For a moment, all eyes turned to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Sun Gan and Shuang Jing glared, fixing Ning Zhuo with sharp looks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo showed no malice. He stood up and cupped his hands with a polite smile, bowing courteously to the entire audience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sun Gan and Shuang Jing both gave cold snorts and withdrew from the bidding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo obtained this group of Daobing and immediately gave them to Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Mu Lan opened her mouth slightly, seemingly intending to refuse on instinct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo sent her a message by divine sense: “Take them, General Mu. Without your letter of recommendation, I wouldn’t even be here at this auction.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“I know Red Flower Camp has taken heavy losses. This batch of Daobing is from the Demon-Soldier Pavilion and is well-trained. You can put them to use right away—just what you need to fill your manpower gap.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“They should be very compatible with the Red Flower Formation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“Red Flower Camp desperately needs medics. Don’t overwork Lord Zhang Zhongyi.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo’s persuasion struck home. Mu Lan nodded slightly, replying in a complex voice through divine sense, “Thank you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo waved a hand as if to say it was just a small gesture, a trivial gift—no need for formality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">After six more lots were sold, Ning Zhuo finally saw what he had been waiting for.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">A puppet workstation—an Ingenious Hand Cabinet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“This is a Nascent Soul–level puppet workstation…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">After a brief introduction, the host concluded, “The asking price is 1,080,000 mid-grade spirit stones.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Two million!” Ning Zhuo was the first to bid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The hall went silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Anyone slightly interested in it gave up upon hearing that bold offer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Just as Ning Zhuo thought he had it secured, a light, airy female voice spoke: “Two million and one hundred thousand.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo raised the bid again: “Two million two hundred thousand.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">She said, “Two million two hundred and one thousand.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo frowned and continued: “Two million six hundred thousand.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">She chuckled. “Three million.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo kept going: “Three million six hundred thousand!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">She laughed out loud: “Six million!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">All at once, the entire hall focused on her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo looked over and saw a female cultivator wearing a mask. Her right arm was replaced by a puppet limb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Her ash-white hair revealed her advanced age.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The masked woman turned slightly, looking at Ning Zhuo. “Boy, where’s your family?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">She seemed to be asking a question, but in truth it was full of insult and provocation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo’s face sank. “May I ask for your name?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The masked woman tilted her chin. “Shuang Ling.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">All the cultivators present were shocked —Machinery Princess!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Shuang Jing gave a bitter laugh, stood, and bowed deeply before everyone. “Aunt, you’ve come to join the war as well?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Machinery Princess Shuang Ling gave a cold snort. “If you’d performed even slightly better in that ambush, I wouldn’t have needed to come all this way to reinforce you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Shuang Jing hastily bowed again. “It was my fault. I failed in battle!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Shuang Ling snorted once more. “Failing in battle is one thing, but to think you even let someone else snatch your bride from you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">She turned to Ning Zhuo. “The future successor of the Grand Marshal’s house —Mu Lan. And her husband is only a Foundation Establishment cultivator?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan both looked taken aback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The entire crowd burst into an uproar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">“What? What’s going on?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">“How could General Mu Lan already have a husband?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">“Is it Ning Zhuo? Seems it’s referring to him. What in the world happened?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">“Impossible! That’s impossible. How could the Tiger Daughter of the Grand Marshal’s house be married already?!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
