<paragraph index="1">Tian Shuang’s five fingers condensed profound ice, forming an icy claw set.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="2">He flew straight toward Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">Zhang Hei only saw a blur before his eyes, a strong gust slashing his face; when he fixed his gaze, Tian Shuang, as if having teleported in an instant, had already attacked his position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="6">The claw set slashed diagonally, and the black snake spear that Zhang Hei had instinctively brandished was directly severed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">Zhang Hei had no time to react; three claw marks appeared on his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">In the previous moment, fresh blood surged. In the next moment, the wound immediately congealed into frost, which, while stopping the bleeding, also eroded his internal organs, limbs, and bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">Zhang Hei felt as though he had suddenly shifted from midsummer to midwinter; his entire body was frozen, every movement sluggish and heavy, extremely arduous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">Tian Shuang swung his claw again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">He was in a very bad mood and was about to take advantage of the close combat to vent his frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">Zhang Hei glared, watching with wide eyes as the fatal blow was about to fall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">Clang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">Guan Hong arrived at the critical moment, and the Blood Dragon Blade blocked the ice claw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">Crack, crack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">The Blood Dragon Blade showed several huge cracks, shattering right before his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">The Xuanhuang Sword slanted in and stabbed directly at Tian Shuang’s face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">Tian Shuang snorted coldly, and with his other hand condensed a Nine Nether Cold Spirit Claw, grabbing the Xuanhuang Sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">Liu Er exerted all his strength, thrusting the sword tip forward, using every ounce of power -gritting his teeth until blood burst -yet it remained completely unmoved!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">Although ghost cultivators were clearly not adept in strength, Liu Er had expended much energy enhancing his flesh foundation, but at this moment, when contesting pure force, he was completely defeated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">The gap between the Nascent Soul level and the Golden Core level was obvious at a glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">“You all…” Ning Zhuo said as he looked at the three generals blocking his path, his emotions surging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">He immediately retreated violently backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">Sun Lingtong was overjoyed and exclaimed, “Little Zhuo, you finally figured it out!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">In the next moment, Ning Zhuo shouted, “Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, if it is me you want, then come and catch me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">Sun Lingtong: ......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">“Hmph, little ghost, arrogant -if I catch you, I’ll pull out your tongue.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Tian Shuang’s twin claws struck forcefully, immediately repelling the three generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">The three generals were drenched in blood on the spot and simultaneously flew backwards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">Tian Shuang charged toward Ning Zhuo, while Di Hui stood aside with arms folded, smiling as he watched the show.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">“Main body, do not get stained with killing again!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Tian Shuang’s ghost face roared and pounced toward Tian Shuang’s main body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">Tian Shuang snorted coldly, and with a swing of his sharp claw, directly clawed through the ghost face’s body, severing it into two pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">The upper half of the ghost face clung to Tian Shuang’s legs and feet, loudly pleading, “Spare the innocent, and you will spare yourself!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Di Gui burst into hearty laughter as he watched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">Tian Shuang lifted his foot, summoned his magic, and with one stomp, crushed the head of the ghost face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Then, frost erupted, completely obliterating the upper half of the ghost face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">The lower half of the ghost face then flew to Ning Zhuo’s side and, after a change in shape, transformed back into an upper half -with a head and face -stretching out its arms to block Ning Zhuo’s path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">Ning Zhuo clasped his hands together and said, “My Buddha above, I shall not enter hell; if I do not enter hell, who will?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">“Tian Shuang, you are a famous expert. I surrender; please spare others.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">Tian Shuang, enraged to the point that his face turned ashen and his honor was completely lost, grinned maniacally and said, “Stinking brat, don’t put on airs before me -I’ll slice you into human sticks!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Lin Bufan looked nervously toward Zhu Xuanji and said, “Lord Divine Captor, shall we attack together?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">Zhu Xuanji instead squinted his eyes, looking at Di Hui, his expression extremely solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">“Not bad, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth -though it appears they are watching a show, they are actually setting an ambush for Tian Shuang!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">“If we try to come to the rescue, we will surely be strongly obstructed by Di Gui.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">“The intention of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth to capture Ning Zhuo alive is very obvious; perhaps we should wait for a chance later? Rather than at this moment when the twin ghosts are on full alert?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">Zhu Xuanji also hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">“Wah ya ya.” Zhang Hei charged toward Tian Shuang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">Tian Shuang swung his claw backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">Zhang Hei once again flew backwards, with blood spurting wildly in mid-air, splattering all along the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">After falling to the ground, even someone as tough as Zhang Hei could not immediately stand up; more than half of his bones were shattered!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">“Zhang Hei, hurry up, leave!” Ning Zhuo shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Zhang Hei struggled to half-kneel, looked up with bloodshot eyes, and said, “Damn it, military strategist, you sacrificed yourself for others, but what do you take me, old Zhang, for?! Fight to the death, fight to the death!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Guan Hong came to his side, helped him up, and at the same time, using his spiritual energy, infused Blood Light to stabilize Zhang Hei’s injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Guan Hong’s beard fluttered as he declared, “A real man in the world, when righteousness calls, how could he care about a single life!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">Liu Er: ......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">He had many words he wanted to say, many sighs, but the atmosphere had reached this point-</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">He also stood by Zhang Hei’s side, with Guan Hong on one side, and said, “The three of us brothers have long sworn brotherhood -not seeking to be born on the same year, month, and day, but praying to die on the same year, month, and day!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">“Meeting the military strategist was the greatest fortune of my life.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">“Living and dying together -this must be now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Tian Shuang’s face was as cold as frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">Di Hui then clapped with delight and said, “Good, well said.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">He looked the three generals up and down with a peculiar gaze and remarked, “It has been a long time since I’ve seen such interesting characters. However, you will absolutely die, but Ning Zhuo will not die. Yet you need not envy him, because he will live a life worse than death, more miserable than you! Hahaha!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">However, whether it was Di Hui, Tian Shuang, Zhu Xuanji, Lin Bufan, Red Sleeve Fairy, or the group of Liu, Guan, Zhang, Ning, and Sun, none of them could see the changes that were secretly taking place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">If Liu Er’s master had been present at the scene and had used methods to observe fate, he would have seen that the collective qi of the three generals’ camp suddenly soared, blossoming like fresh flowers, resulting in a qualitative improvement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">The monkey-like qi became even more concentrated, lifelike, and extraordinarily dynamic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Among the qi, an arm-shaped strand of qi also benefited greatly, profiting enormously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Amid the swirling mechanical dragon, Sun Lingtong was extremely anxious; suddenly, fortune struck him, and his inspiration burst forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">“Little Zhuo, Little Zhuo! I have thought of a way!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Sun Lingtong quickly transmitted his mental consciousness to remind Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up as he pushed his palms forward with all his strength, unleashing a round of Five Elements spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Before the spell was even halfway through the air, it was completely frozen and suppressed by the cold air that Tian Shuang had spat out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">“Naive!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">“Did you really think that you would have any power in front of me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Tian Shuang’s expression of disdain suddenly froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">It was all because Ning Zhuo had taken a few steps forward and stood behind Tian Shuang’s false face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">It turned out that Ning Zhuo’s previous offensive was merely to attract attention -a feint to cover up his true tactical objective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">Tian Shuang subconsciously felt something was amiss and immediately prepared to strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">But Ning Zhuo undoubtedly acted faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">“It must succeed!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Ning Zhuo’s momentum erupted as he placed both palms on Tian Shuang’s ghost face, directly unleashing his most powerful trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">Divine technique -Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">A thread of suspended life, as if a string of fate, descended from the sky and landed on the top of Tian Shuang’s ghost face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">At that moment, time seemed to slow down dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Under the strong anticipation of Sun and Ning, the suspended thread completely landed on the head of Tian Shuang’s ghost face, forming… a connection!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">Life Hanging by a Thread, succeeded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Ning Zhuo exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, but at the same time felt immense pressure, as if a mountain were pressing on his heart and mind, making it hard to breathe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">It had to be known that Tian Shuang’s ghost face was an existence of the Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">It was created through the ghost face technique, borrowing the power of Tian Shuang’s main body, and had condensed into form, possessing part of Tian Shuang’s might and combat power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">All along, limited by Ning Zhuo’s cultivation, his Life Hanging by a Thread divine technique had never been applied to a Nascent Soul level being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">Whether it was Lin Bufan or Elder Ape, it had always been the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">But now, he had made a critical, massive breakthrough!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">This was logically justifiable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Ning Zhuo’s flesh foundation had been continuously improving, allowing him to be empower more by the Hero's Return Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">Since the battle began, he had almost lost all his mechanical puppets, with his stock already dropping below a hundred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">He had even released the heavily armored Blood Ape: Dasheng; the loss of this Golden Core level mechanism was also within the scope of the Hero's Return Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">On one hand, it was Ning Zhuo’s own strength that had been leveraged to an unprecedented degree by the Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">On the other hand, although Tian Shuang’s ghost face was of the Nascent Soul level, in essence it had already been weakened to its extreme limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">The most crucial point was that, under the communication of divine consciousness, Tian Shuang’s ghost face actively cooperated with Ning Zhuo without a trace of resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">All these factors ultimately led to the successful connection of Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">Once successful, Ning Zhuo immediately infused a large amount of Buddhist thought from his mind, along the suspended thread, into the body of Tian Shuang’s ghost face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">The ghost face then surged with Buddha light, shining brilliantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">Wearing Tian Shuang’s face, it now became full of mercy, clasping its hands together, bowing its head, and beginning to recite Buddhist scriptures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Tian Shuang was enraged and, like lightning, pounced to the front of Ning Zhuo and the ghost face, slashing fiercely with his sharp claw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">He intended to capture Ning Zhuo alive; this strike was aimed solely at Tian Shuang’s ghost face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Every breath that this ghost face continued to exist was a humiliation to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Clang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">A crisp metallic sound rang out as a powerful ice claw blocked Tian Shuang’s ice claw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">All three generals who were on their way arrived and saw this scene, their eyes widening in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Tian Shuang lost his color, his expression trembling!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Because the one blocking him was none other than himself -not someone else, nor Tian Shuang’s ghost face, but himself!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Di Gui’s smile of amusement vanished without a trace as he stared intently at Tian Shuang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Tian Shuang knew the reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">In his divine sea, a massive amount of Buddhist thought reappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">“Why?! I did not use Frost Soul Gaze to attack his divine sea!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">That doubt flashed only for a moment, and Tian Shuang immediately guessed a deeper reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">“Damn it, it’s the ghost face technique!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Ghost face technique -this is a spell that can borrow the power of a great ghost to condense into a fixed mask.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">The stronger the great ghost’s power, the stronger the ghost face’s power became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">This meant that there was a subtle connection between the great ghost and the ghost face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">When Ning Zhuo connected to Tian Shuang’s ghost face, he could also transfer through it, affecting Tian Shuang’s main body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">Coincidentally, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth had practiced the ghost face technique extremely profoundly -to the point of covering their entire bodies, essentially acting as clones!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">This meant that the connection between the two was far stronger than that of ordinary ghost face techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">Ghost face technique was a classic spell, and Sun Lingtong, being from an evil sect, was well aware of this inner connection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">The Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth were not unaware, so they never casually distributed their ghost faces; they only handed them over to each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">Moreover, these two were almost inseparable, acting in tandem, thereby enabling close and rigorous supervision!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">The greatest unexpected twist in this battle was that Tian Shuang was counterattacked by the backlash of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, and Buddhist thoughts had once severely restricted his performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">Therefore, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were both very clear that Buddhist thoughts had an excellent effect on Tian Shuang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">This was also the reason why, upon hearing Sun Lingtong’s proposal, Ning Zhuo -even though he knew it was extremely risky -was willing to try.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">He seized the deep hint hidden within the appearance, a reminder from fate- that in this fierce battle where the enemy was strong and we were weak, with both sides’ strength extremely mismatched, this might be the only chance for victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">Buddhist thoughts also surged once again in the divine sea of Tian Shuang’s main body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">Buddha Heart Demon Seal!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">Ning Zhuo had never, in his life, invoked this magical treasure so fervently and frenziedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">Thus, Buddha light also shone in Tian Shuang’s divine sea, and Buddha’s thought grew more and more -once unleashed, it was unstoppable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">“I…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">Tian Shuang still wanted to struggle, but his normal thoughts were quickly suppressed by the Buddha light, overwhelmed and drowned by the subsequent Buddha’s thought like a tidal wave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">Di Gui, sensing the unfavorable situation, cast a spell to remotely attack Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">Tian Shuang swung his claw, standing by Ning Zhuo’s side, and blocked Di Gui’s attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">Tian Shuang, with a face full of compassion, earnestly pleaded to Di Hui, “My comrade, turning back is salvation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">Di Hui: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
