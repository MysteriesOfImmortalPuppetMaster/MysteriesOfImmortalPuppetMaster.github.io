<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 269: Soul Searching Ning Zhuo</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Why are these characters... so small?" Zhu Xuanji frowned deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He strained his eyes, but his vision remained blurry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The blazing flames had distorted much of what he could see at the time, obscuring his view.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Xiaohui's handwriting was minuscule, embedded within the inner layer of the ice block, making it difficult to discern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This was indeed troublesome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">For Zhu Xuanji, if he had the physical object before him, he could have easily uncovered the truth with a sweep of his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">But what he was seeing now was a product of combined innate talent and spells, which did not allow for better clarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Couldnâ€™t it have been written a bit larger?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Ning Xiaohui knew her fate was sealed. Before her death, she used all her strength to create the ice brick, hoping it would be preserved." This was a plausible scenario.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"After all, the Ice Jade Hand is adept at surviving desperate situations." But ultimately, the ice brick was not left behind. "Innate talent is not the same as divine ability..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">As he pondered this, a glint of insight flashed in Zhu Xuanji's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Ning Xiaohui seemed overly cautious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Furthermore, if she intended to leave clues, why didnâ€™t she reveal the truth directly when she faced Zheng Shuangjunâ€™s avatar?" One possibility was that Ning Xiaohui discovered something crucial or had a sudden realization after parting with Zheng Shuangjun's avatar. "Another possibility is that, before her death, Ning Xiaohui's mind was twisted by a desire for revenge, leading her to frame her enemies." There's also the possibility...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"In Ning Xiaohui's view, Zheng Shuangjun was not trustworthy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Or, perhaps, she wanted to report directly to me rather than informing a Golden Core cultivator first." Zhu Xuanji's mind raced with various thoughts, each rising and falling like waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">There were too many possibilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">After a while, he set aside his chaotic thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"It can be confirmed that Sun Lingtong is the murderer of Ning Xiaohui." Moreover, he possesses the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">What Zhu Xuanji saw in the second forest confirmed this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra! As recorded in the royal secrets, this Buddhist scripture can liberate life and extract spirituality." Sun Lingtong's mastery of this scripture is a clear indication of the Void Sect's deep infiltration into the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Void Sect..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zhu Xuanji silently gritted his teeth, feeling unprecedented hatred toward the Void Sect due to the day's events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Calm down. Stay calm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Anger is useless. The wisest decision now is to find Meng Kui!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Zhu Xuanji barely managed to stabilize his mood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">With a wave of his arm, he collected all the silver furnace fragments scattered across the field.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Although he couldnâ€™t clearly see Ning Xiaohuiâ€™s dying testimony, it didnâ€™t matter; he had other methods!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"You all clean up the battlefield and try to gather clues." "Iâ€™m going out of the palace to speak with Meng Kui!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Before leaving, Zhu Xuanji noticed Ning Zhuo looking at him eagerly. "Oh, right. Protect him!" "He is a pawn arranged by the Void Sect, but he has now repented and turned to the light."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The three Golden Core ancestors exchanged puzzled glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Zhu Xuanji continued, "Ning Zhuo is a crucial witness; his life must be protected at all costs!" The three Golden Core cultivators quickly nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The next moment, Zhu Xuanji soared into the sky, leaving Ning Zhuo to face the scrutinizing gazes of the Golden Core cultivators alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo, ever clever, immediately ran to Ning Jiufan's side. "Ancestor, Ancestor!" Ning Jiufan snorted coldly. "Tell us everything you know."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Though his expression was stern, he extended his arm to pull Ning Zhuo closer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo had already prepared a statement, which he had carefully crafted, originally intended for a second line of defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Now, he slightly altered the content and relayed it to the three Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Golden Core ancestors perked up their ears, listening intently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zhu Xuanji hadnâ€™t heard it yet, but they learned first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Meanwhile, Zhu Xuanji continued his journey, leaving the Immortal Palace once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Outside the Immortal Palace, the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were in a frenzy, their attacks growing increasingly aggressive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">However, with the Tomb Dao's assistance, Zhu Xuanji managed to leave smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhu Xuanji flew directly to Meng Kuiâ€™s location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"City Lord Meng Kui, I have important information regarding the recent changes in the Lava Immortal Palace to share with you," Zhu Xuanji said directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Meng Kui responded, "Lord Zhu, please enlighten me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Although Meng Kui was at the Nascent Soul level, Zhu Xuanji represented the royal family, so they communicated as equals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhu Xuanji then explained how Ning Zhuo had confessed, speculating that the Void Sect was the mastermind behind the scenes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Meng Kui's heart stirred, and after a moment of silence, he remarked, "What a Void Sect! Infiltrating the Lava Immortal Palace right under my nose with sinister intentions, inciting a Golden Core conflict. Now, killing Ning Xiaohui and destroying the Historical Records Pavilion just to eliminate evidence." "Since they were able to bombard the Historical Records Pavilion, itâ€™s likely that the previous mysterious attack on Fire Persimmon Mountain by the Five Elements Tower, triggering a beast frenzy, was also their doing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Such disregard for the lives of thousands in the city, truly demonic cultivators!" Zhu Xuanji cautioned, "This is just my speculation, without concrete evidence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"I naturally trust Lord Zhuâ€™s deductions," Meng Kui smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Zhu Xuanji gave Meng Kui a deep look and stated his intention: "Since the Void Sect is a third-party force behind the scenes and has acted so outrageously, you and I should fully cooperate to eliminate them first!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Meng Kui nodded, "Indeed. What plans does Lord Zhu have?" Zhu Xuanji spoke eloquently, outlining his strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Meng Kui smiled, "Lord Zhuâ€™s words are reasonable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"If the Void Sect truly seizes the position of Palace Master, both the royal family and my Meng family will lose face."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"I also express my sincerity once againâ€”willing to promise that regardless of whether itâ€™s between you and me or among the other three families, whoever ultimately becomes the Palace Master, all our current positions in the Lava Immortal Palace will remain unchanged! Once the matter of the Lava Immortal Palace is settled, even if there are changes in positions, they will be according to the courtâ€™s rules. What do you think?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhu Xuanjiâ€™s pupils contracted sharply, and alarm bells rang in his mind!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"What a Meng Kui! This is a blatant open scheme."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"No, perhaps someone among the three families has already secretly contacted Meng Kui..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zhu Xuanji could poach and win over the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">As the city lord, backed by the Meng family, Meng Kui naturally had similar means.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Itâ€™s just a matter of who acted first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">In the current situation, Zhu Xuanji could only acknowledge and go with the flow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Soon, they reached a cooperation agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Both Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui were under the Southern Bean Kingdom, belonging to the same faction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Previously, although they regarded each other as primary opponents, they maintained a level of competition, always keeping a state of rivalry without breaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Thus, joining forces at this moment presented no obstacles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui both aimed to eliminate the Void Sect, allowing the position of city lord to be contested between their two factions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">If the Void Sect succeeded, the Zhu family of the Southern Bean Kingdomâ€™s royal family and the Meng family of high officials would become laughingstocks, bringing shame...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This was something neither of them could accept!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">After signing the contract, Zhu Xuanji took out a jade slip and handed it to Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The jade slip contained all the evidence, clues, and speculations he had gathered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Most crucially, it contained the three scenes Zhu Xuanji "saw" on the silver furnace ruins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Meng Kui held the jade slip, slowly closed his eyes, and his Nascent Soul-level aura suddenly expanded, fully utilizing his calculation method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">For a moment, mysteries overflowed, and smoke clouds billowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Several strands of Meng Kuiâ€™s hair instantly turned frost white.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He opened his eyes, revealing a look of fatigue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Calculations often required consuming one of the most precious resources in the worldâ€”lifespan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">This time, Meng Kuiâ€™s calculations were no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">However, Zhu Xuanji had already promised that the lifespan consumed in this calculation would be compensated with longevity lingzhi from the royal treasury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zhu Xuanji asked, "Did you gain anything?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Meng Kui nodded slightly, "I obtained four clues. They are: Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, Zheng Danlian, and the Golden Furnace." For a moment, Zhu Xuanji frowned tightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The appearance of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong was completely understandable to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">But why Zheng Dan?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">And why the Golden Furnace?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Zheng Danlian was one of the two Golden Core cultivators of the Zheng family, and the Golden Furnace was the highest-grade refining furnace in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Why were these two clues mentioned by Ning Xiaohui before her death?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Meng Kui interrupted Zhu Xuanji's thoughts: "Among the four clues, Ning Zhuo is the easiest to investigate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173"> In my opinion, we should directly capture him and conduct a soul search!" Ning Zhuo was only at the Qi Refining Stage, easy to handle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The only challenge was dealing with Ning Jiufanâ€™s reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Zhu Xuanji didnâ€™t hesitate and directly refused: "Inappropriate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Ning Zhuo indeed has ties with the Void Sect, but I have already made him confess and surrender." "He is my person and will be of great use in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Meng Kui smiled slightly, unfazed by the refusal: "Lord Zhu, as a divine constable, is naturally more adept at solving cases and pursuing criminals than I am. I will watch with anticipation." With that, Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui parted ways.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">As Zhu Xuanjiâ€™s figure faded into the distance, Meng Kuiâ€™s gaze turned cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"It seems Zhu Xuanji hasnâ€™t realized that the dragon turtle fire spirit has already developed other intentions." "But at this rate, he will soon!" "Void Sect? Hmph!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Meng Kui didnâ€™t place much importance on the Void Sectâ€™s activities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">After all, the Void Sect had only dispatched one Golden Core true disciple and one Foundation Establishment Stage outer disciple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">If a Nascent Soul-level cultivator from the Void Sect had appeared, it would be an entirely different matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thus, even though Meng Kui discovered that the Void Sect was a third-party force lurking all along, he didnâ€™t rush to take action personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Stabilize it with calmness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Let Zhu Xuanji investigate the Void Sect. Itâ€™s good to occupy some of his time and energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">With that thought, Meng Kui sent orders, commanding the cultivators on his side in the Immortal Palace to strive for as many key positions as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">At the same time, he ordered his trusted aides to make every effort to contact the dragon turtle fire spirit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Zhu Xuanji returned to the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Along the way, his brows remained tightly furrowed, his gaze deep and contemplative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">If Ning Zhuo hadnâ€™t confessed voluntarily, in the current situation, Zhu Xuanji might have hesitatedâ€”considering whether to soul search Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">But now, having just turned to the light, Ning Zhuo was to be soul searched?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The consequences of a soul search were severe, ranging from memory loss to dementia.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">In such matters, anyone with political acumen wouldnâ€™t make such a rash decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Least of all, Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Now, with the alliance of the three families, a rift has already formed with the Zheng family. If I soul search Ning Zhuo, it would lead to a superficial relationship with the Ning family." "Meng Kui wants me to soul search Ning Zhuo... He's just a small Qi Refining Stage cultivator, an outer pawn of the Void Sect. What could he possibly know?" "Moreover, Meng Kui is also suspicious!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Zhu Xuanji calculated the time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">When the Lava Immortal Palace breach occurred, Meng Kui didnâ€™t take action promptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The three Golden Core cultivators had all sent emergency flying messages, but without Meng Kuiâ€™s protection, those messages would be attacked and destroyed by the omnipresent Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts as soon as they left the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"So, Meng Kui deliberately suppressed the spread of the messages, delaying their transmission and causing me to receive them very late." "The Meng familyâ€™s desire to seize the Lava Immortal Palace is too intense."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
