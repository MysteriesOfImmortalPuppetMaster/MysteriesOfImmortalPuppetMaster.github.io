<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhao Xi’s current situation was not very good.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This time, under his command, the main forces of Two Note Nation organized Nascent Soul–level battle teams, specifically to counter the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Under the Twin's divine abilitie of the Heaven and Earth Combined Strike, only three Nascent Soul cultivators managed to escape with their lives; all the others perished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This was an extremely significant loss for the main forces of Two Note Nation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">And as the current highest leader, Zhao Xi had an inescapable responsibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"I should have stuck to my original intention; there was no need to provoke the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts!" Zhao Xi’s own fighting spirit was not particularly strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">But he had no choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In that position, one must manage state affairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Previously, the Twins, Red Sleeve Fairy, and others had been extremely arrogant, and had successfully seized the spoils of war from the main forces of Two Note Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The generals of Two Note Nation all wanted to reclaim their dignity and boost morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Of course, among them there was also the intention to test Zhao Xi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">If this battle had been won, Zhao Xi could have continued to stabilize his authority. But the fact was, this battle ended in a crushing defeat, and Zhao Xi’s previously promising beginning was nearly entirely lost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Zhao Xi made an effort to keep his expression and tone calm: “Everyone, do not worry; in this battle, our Two Note Nation will definitely win!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“This is just a minor setback; let us observe the situation for now. Have Zhenren Liev yang and the other cultivators return to camp to obtain the most detailed intelligence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">A Nascent Soul–level general snorted coldly: “For now, there is nothing else we can do.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Another general also said: “I had already mentioned earlier, do not be so reckless. In military affairs, one should never start a war in anger. Alas, honest advice is harsh to the ear but beneficial for action.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zhao Xi’s face was as cold as ice, and he looked coldly at the cultivator who had spoken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Those two cultivators, however, did not back down and looked at him openly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The atmosphere in the chamber consequently became tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Just then, a subordinate reported that three Nascent Soul cultivators had returned from the front line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Zhao Xi said, “Let them come in.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After a dozen or so breaths, the three Nascent Soul cultivators, led by Liev Yang Zhenren, walked into the room and met everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Alas, a defeated general returns to offer his apologies!” Liev Yang Zhenren immediately clasped his hands in salute, his face full of utter defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zhao Xi and the others all cast their eyes on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">They saw that the three Nascent Soul cultivators were each covered in blood, in a pitiful state, and although their expressions showed shame, there was still an obvious trace of fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zhao Xi snorted coldly: “I entrusted this meticulously selected battle team to you. Liev Yang, is this how you act?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“You are indeed at fault!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Now begin your atonement; first, explain everything you know and have heard so that we may deliberate and update our countermeasures.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Liev Yang Zhenren no longer had his previous arrogance reminiscent of a golden crow; he looked up to the sky with a long sigh and obediently replied, “Yes, Lord Zhao.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Meanwhile, Floating Cloud Master shook his head: “It is impossible; there is simply no way to defeat the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Their combined Strike of Heaven and Earth, with its overwhelming might, could not be resisted at all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“You were simply lucky, not having been chosen, and thus you remained alive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Floating Cloud Master’s expression was extremely dejected, devoid of any fighting spirit, utterly lost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Zhao Xi coldly shouted, “Shut up!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He pointed at Floating Cloud Master: “Your Dao companion, Mountain Yuezi, has perished; it is understandable that you are disheartened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But now, with the great battle imminent, if you continue to speak recklessly and undermine the morale, I will behead you as a warning to others!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Floating Cloud Master stared dumbly at Zhao Xi and, with a sorrowful smile, said, “Enough, enough.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">A main general of the Nascent Soul level, however, looked at Zhao Xi and suddenly said, “All three of them are warriors; they were able to face the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth head-on and return with their lives. In my personal opinion, there is nothing to criticize!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The implication was that as the commander-in-chief, Zhao Xi bore an inescapable heavy responsibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhao Xi glared fiercely at the one who had spoken: “You!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Northern Dipper Sword Master looked at everyone arguing, his face filled with gloom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He was a sword cultivator, but the flying sword he used to behead enemies in battle had, in this fight, become his lifeline for escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">His pride was crushed, and all he wanted was revenge: “You all go ahead and talk; I am going to immediately retreat into seclusion to recover from my injuries as soon as possible!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">If the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth come to kill, call my name, and I will definitely fight with all my might to wash away this humiliation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">After saying that, the Northern Dipper Sword Master turned and left, not even looking back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhao Xi, as the leader of the principal stronghold, naturally suffered a great loss of face. The Northern Dipper Sword Master’s unilateral behavior revealed the severe loss of Zhao Xi’s authority.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">However, just as the Northern Dipper Sword Master had just opened the door and was about to step outside, a cultivator delivering a message, carrying an intelligence jade slip, ran in ecstatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Good news! Good news coming from the front!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Our army has won.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“The Three General Battalion has won!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“They have driven away the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth! In fact, it is very likely that they inflicted casualties upon the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Uh!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The message-bearing cultivator ran into the hall and saw that nearly everyone’s eyes were fixed on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In an instant, an enormous pressure like a mountain weighed down on him, making it extremely difficult for him to breathe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“This is impossible!!” The closest Northern Dipper Sword Master, his eyes wide like bronze bells, blurted out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The message-bearing cultivator was so frightened that his legs went weak, and he immediately sat down on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Another general slammed his hand on the table and said fiercely, “Falsely transmitting military intelligence -your crime is heinous; you must know that you will be beheaded!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Even Zhao Xi himself could not believe it; he shouted, “What exactly is this military intelligence? Present it immediately.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The message-bearing cultivator’s body trembled; he was startled awake, quickly got up, and in full view of everyone, hurriedly ran to Zhao Xi and handed over the jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He was so frightened that he didn’t dare say a single word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zhao Xi sent his divine sense into the jade slip, his face gloomy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The discussion hall was utterly silent, and all eyes were on Zhao Xi, such that any slightest change in his expression would be noticed by the observant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Then, everyone saw Zhao Xi’s unprecedented, dazzling expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Originally, his eyes were squinted, but suddenly they opened as wide as possible, as if he were going to stare his eyeballs out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The shock he experienced was so immense and fierce that even Zhao Xi, who always valued his own authority and bearing, subconsciously opened his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He was so shocked that he could not close his mouth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After the intense shock, his shrunken pupils quickly dilated, and his whole face, previously as cold as ice, suddenly transformed as if it were springtime - in an instant becoming bright and everything seeming renewed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“We won! The Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth have fled in defeat!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“The Three General Battalion has won!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“A great feat! Ning Zhuo has achieved a great feat!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Good, good indeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“Wonderful, absolutely wonderful!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“Hahaha.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The generals looked at each other in disbelief, all finding it hard to believe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Some people stared at Zhao Xi, not forgetting to remind him, “Lord of the Inspecting Army, do not misjudge lightly. You are, after all, the highest leader of our main forces!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But Zhao Xi gave him a disdainful glance, and his laughing did not cease; instead, it grew even more vigorous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">For a moment, Zhao Xi’s hearty laughter filled the conference hall, echoing in everyone’s ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“This military intelligence is supported by conclusive evidence. Not only are there detailed images, but also treasures such as the recovered bronze sundial!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“In fact, the Three General Battalion is on their triumphant return journey.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“In this battle, our army first suffered a defeat but then turned the tide, with the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth fleeing in defeat. We have won!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Saying that, he then directly flung the jade slip in his hand onto the face of the general who had insisted earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The general quickly dodged, hurriedly caught the jade slip, and immediately used his divine sense to examine it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In the next moment, his expression also changed, becoming extremely astonished: “Incredible, Ning Zhuo - this young fellow, what kind of sorcery did he use? Could he actually cause Tian Shuang to reverse his allegiance?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Reverse, reverse?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“Who reversed?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Did I hear that correctly? I think I heard that the Heavenly Ghost reversed his allegiance?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The other generals were all flabbergasted; none of them could sit still, and they all stood up one after another, extending their hands toward the jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">However, one person was even faster than them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">That was the Northern Dipper Sword Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Northern Dipper Sword Master, holding the jade slip in his hand and reading through its contents, stood dumbfounded in place: “We really won?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“But did any of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth die?!” Floating Cloud Master became agitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">His Dao companion, Mountain Yuezi, had died in the combined attack of Heaven and Earth; the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth were his greatest enemies in this lifetime.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Floating Cloud Master felt that lifelong revenge was hopeless, and he had never imagined that he would witness news of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth being defeated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">However, Floating Cloud Master did not grab the jade slip; the generals surrounded the Northern Dipper Sword Master, and several hands at once held onto the jade slip, with multiple streams of divine sense simultaneously pouring into it, competing to read the military intelligence contained within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In an instant, exclamations of surprise arose one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Soon, the jade slip was passed around among everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zhao Xi still sat in his main seat with a face as hard as iron. Yet, anyone could feel his relaxation, his joy, his exhilaration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Zhao Xi coughed twice to attract everyone’s attention and said, “The Three General Battalion has achieved a great feat this time and must be greatly rewarded.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“One must remember, the opponent was none other than the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">It was precisely because a large number of Nascent Soul cultivators perished in the combined attack of Heaven and Earth that the extraordinary martial achievements of Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning were further highlighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Reward! We must certainly greatly reward these heroes!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“In this great battle, our Two Note Nation will definitely win!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Zhao Xi still could not contain himself; in the end, he clenched his fist, raised his arm, and shouted aloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The generals fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Liev Yang Zhenren, the Northern Dipper Sword Master, and Floating Cloud Master each wore different expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Zhao Xi glared, swept his gaze over everyone, and with a nasal hum uttered a sound full of menace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The generals, sensing this, quickly spoke up, each expressing joy, a firm conviction in their own side’s great victory, and recognition and allegiance to the wise leader Zhao Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“With the Three General Battalion achieving such an extraordinary feat, how should we reward them?” Liev Yang Zhenren suddenly asked, his expression complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Zhao Xi did not catch the implied meaning and waved his hand grandly: “Our army has always been clear in its rewards and punishments; naturally, rewards are based on merits, given strictly according to achievements, and at the fastest speed, we shall distribute these merits, reward the heroes, and inspire the troops!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Liev Yang Zhenren nodded: “That is only natural.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“But…” his tone changed, “this Ning Zhuo fellow’s skills are remarkable; his future is boundless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Being able to defeat the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, his strength is unexpectedly great, and it might influence the upcoming battle situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">We should definitely protect him well!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">These words caused the joy on Zhao Xi’s face to suddenly subside considerably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He immediately fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Many of the generals also discerned Liev Yang Zhenren’s hidden meaning and fell silent in contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">After a moment, Zhao Xi spoke: “What Liev Yang Zhenren is worried about is indeed valid. Quick, send out a troop to leave the camp and greet.. -quickly bring back Young Master Ning Zhuo into the camp! He is the greatest hero of this battle!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">However, when the generals, led by Zhao Xi, met with the Three General Battalion, they discovered that Ning Zhuo had vanished without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">“Where is Ning Zhuo? Where is Young Master Ning Zhuo?!” Zhao Xi demanded of Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Liu Er, clasping his hands in salutation, said, “Reporting to Lord Zhao, after this battle, while our army was cleaning the battlefield, a Nascent Soul cultivator appeared and identified himself as the bodyguard of Chief Strategist Ning Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“The Chief Strategist had long been taken away by his bodyguard.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“Ah?!” Zhao Xi glared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The group of Nascent Soul cultivators were all stunned as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Liev Yang Zhenren urgently asked, “Are you sure he is Ning Zhuo’s bodyguard? Liu Er, can you guarantee it? If we have been deceived, the greatest hero of our battle will lose his life, and our Two Note Nation will be turned into a laughingstock!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">“Are you capable of bearing such heavy responsibility?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Liu Er looked steadily at Liev Yang Zhenren, puffed out his chest, and said with utmost confidence, “We are absolutely certain. After this person revealed his identity, Chief Strategist Ning recovered and personally confirmed it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Liev Yang Zhenren’s eyelids twitched slightly; he gritted his teeth, and, suppressing the regret in his heart, forced a small smile: “That’s good, that’s good!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Zhao Xi sighed; without having obtained Ning Zhuo, he could not secure the means to continue to counterbalance the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">His heart was filled with regret, but he could only smile at Liu, Guan, and Zhang, saying, “You have all worked hard. This deadly battle has demonstrated the courage of the Three General Battalion and showcased the military might and fighting spirit of our Two Note Nation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">“Come with me back to the main camp, and you shall surely be richly rewarded!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Liu Er immediately bowed and thanked him loudly, secretly feeling glad for Ning Zhuo -having narrowly avoided this calamity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">It turned out that Tian Shuang chased after Di Hui, and as the battle concluded, Zhu Xuanji, who had been observing all along, furrowed his brow deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">He harbored a huge doubt in his heart -did Ning Zhuo actually possess the “Life Thread Hanging by a Thread” divine ability?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Regarding this divine ability, the Souhtern Bean Royal Family knew many secrets. One of them was that unless one had mastered mysterious methods, most people would find it difficult to detect the Life Thread Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Cultivators who had mastered the divine ability of Life Thread Hanging by a Thread would be able to detect the Life Thread Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Otherwise, the Souhtern Bean Royal Family would not have gone to such great lengths as to dispatch Shen Lingshu to probe indirectly for this answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">At that time, Ning Zhuo’s state, having received the blessing of a military strategy, was at the peak level of the Golden Core stage. If he possessed this divine ability, he would have been able to connect with the Tian Shuang mask.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">But despite the divine ability not requiring bodily contact, Ning Zhuo still had both palms pressed against the back of the ghost’s face -this action negated that possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">“Merely relying on my Buddha Heart Demon Seal, could it be enough to infuse the ghost face with Buddhist thoughts and thereby affect its body?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“In any case, Ning Zhuo’s situation was not safe; we should rescue him first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Zhu Xuanji then had Lin Bufan step forward to go and pick up Ning Zhuo and bring him back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">After Ning Zhuo fell unconscious, Sun Lingtong harnessed the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and flew out from Ning Zhuo’s waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Although he did not leave the mechanical dragon, he still revealed his aura and voice, indicating his identity to the Three Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Guan Hong stroked his beard and said, “During the earlier fierce battle, I indeed sensed that someone had intervened and removed the ice spear from the Chief Strategist. It turns out it was you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Zhang Hei “guessed” Sun Lingtong’s identity and said knowingly, “Oh, I see, you are the Chief Strategist’s little bookboy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Liu Er then looked at the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon; he had long noticed this mechanical creation, but at this moment pretended to see it for the first time, and sincerely exclaimed, “The Chief Strategist is so devoted and righteous -it is truly moving. With such a creation, he could have easily traversed the void and withdrawn in advance. But instead, he has stayed with us in a life-and-death battle without retreating. How fortunate I, Liu Er, am to have such a comrade!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">At these words, Guan and Zhang also changed their expressions, showing signs of being moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes and thought to himself, “Do you really think we never considered retreat?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Of course he would not say it explicitly; seeing the expressions of the Three Generals, he figured he should let this delightful misunderstanding continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">At this time, Lin Bufan stepped forward of his own accord, arousing the vigilance of the soldiers of the Three General Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Of course, Liu, Guan, and Zhang did not trust Lin Bufan immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">But at that moment, Sun Lingtong spoke up on behalf of Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Lin Bufan then secretly demonstrated the “Wood within Fire” to the Three Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">The Three Generals eventually initially trusted him, but still did not let Ning Zhuo leave, until Ning Zhuo awoke and confirmed Lin Bufan’s identity for himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Lin Bufan advised Ning Zhuo, suggesting that he separate from the Three General Battalion and should not return to the main camp of Two Note Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Ning Zhuo also had this idea, so after the distribution of the spoils of war, he bid farewell to the Three Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
