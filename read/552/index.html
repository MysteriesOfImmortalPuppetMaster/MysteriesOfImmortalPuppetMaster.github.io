<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 552: Chaos</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
It was chaos, total chaos.<br/>
<br/>
The previous order among the fighting generals was completely lost at that moment, and the entire battlefield plunged into chaos.<br/>
<br/>
Because the ingenious princess Shuang Ling fully blocked Xiang Yue’s charge, many Nascent Soul-level cultivators were thus liberated, taking the lead to attack the camp’s city wall.<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Shadow Cave Master entered the battle again, and with one wave of her hand, released over a hundred streaks of scarlet whips.<br/>
<br/>
The whips penetrated the electric net, with only half remaining, striking the city wall and causing blood to seep through the wall bricks, which quickly collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi shouted a harsh command, threw out a military card, and deployed the Iron Wall Taoist soldiers; with the support of military strength, they temporarily held back the demon blood.<br/>
<br/>
The Poison Scorpion Cave Master let out a coquettish laugh, the cloud-like gauze lightly fluttering, and the venomous sting on her scorpion tail fiercely stabbed dozens of times.<br/>
<br/>
Every forward stab condensed a purple glimmering tail-hook needle shadow that flew into the air and pierced the city wall. Three watchtowers on the city wall exploded with a boom; purple poisonous mist accompanied the explosion, rapidly spreading in all directions, and before the bricks and stones could fall, they were eroded into flying ash by the poisonous mist.<br/>
<br/>
“Demoness, perish!” The army beneath this section of the city wall was none other than the Red Flower Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
As the commander, Mu Lan naturally would not sit by and wait to be killed, and immediately drew her bow like a crescent, shooting toward the Poison Scorpion Cave Master.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan’s divine ability, Red Heart Hawk Arrow, with unsurpassed power, had long been well-known and deeply remembered by both sides.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, when the Poison Scorpion Cave Master saw Mu Lan raise her bow and arrow, intending to shoot her, she immediately let out a shriek and fled backward like a startled bird at the sound of a bow, not daring to linger for even a moment.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Mu Lan’s divine ability had caused severe damage to Lord Long, shot and killed Di Lu, and defeated the Ancient God of the Azure Moon - she had a fearsome reputation.<br/>
<br/>
Although the ingenious palace master Shuang Ling had also defeated many Nascent Soul cultivators, she had not been able to eradicate them completely, as the Nascent Souls of Bi Teng Yi and others had all fled.<br/>
<br/>
From this perspective, although Mu Lan was only at the Golden Core level, in the eyes of the enemy, she was even more terrifying than Shuang Ling!<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan sneered coldly, and in the next moment, she put away her bow and arrow.<br/>
<br/>
Military strategy - bluffing!<br/>
<br/>
This strategy could consume military strength and cause the cultivators’ morale to change unpredictably. Therefore, Mu Lan feigned the appearance of using her divine ability, Red Heart Hawk Arrow, deceiving the Poison Scorpion Cave Master.<br/>
<br/>
With this tactic, she frightened off the powerful enemy at minimal cost.<br/>
<br/>
The Poison Scorpion Cave Master, having been deceived, was not angry but instead covered her mouth and let out a coquettish laugh.<br/>
<br/>
However, the rest of the generals from the Thousand Peaks Forest all felt a tightening in their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Having revealed this tactic, henceforth, every time she used the divine ability Red Heart Hawk Arrow, she had to be cautious.<br/>
<br/>
Because it was difficult to discern the real from the fake - even if it was false - they had to defend with all their might!<br/>
<br/>
What if it's real?<br/>
<br/>
The howling of wolves arose loudly.<br/>
<br/>
Guya pointed his wolf-tooth club forward, and countless wolf packs, one after another, converged into a tide of soldiers, fiercely charging at the city wall.<br/>
<br/>
Blue Sea Soldier Tide Formation!<br/>
<br/>
The formation cultivators in the two main battalions of the nation immediately activated their formation arrays; this was one of the three great city-defense formation arrays.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, azure waves surged like a raging tide, gushing out from the surface of the city wall and washing away all enemies.<br/>
<br/>
The wolf packs were submerged by the azure waves, and on the spot, more than half of them were lost.<br/>
<br/>
The azure waves quickly transformed the battlefield, turning the originally rocky ground into a shallow water marsh.<br/>
<br/>
Guya invoked his spell to support the remaining wolf packs, continuing to charge at the city wall.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, from the turquoise puddles, a large number of soldiers rose up.<br/>
<br/>
These Taoist soldiers, formed from condensed green water, all rushed to kill any enemy nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, they had no intelligence, nor did they form any formation; they attacked with all their might, continuously assaulting.<br/>
<br/>
Guya sighed inwardly, having no choice but to mobilize the wolf packs to fight against these azure wave Taoist soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
Li Jiuqu snickered continuously, put away the Rot Immortal Poison Loulou, and released a large clump of Golden Silkworm Gu.<br/>
<br/>
The cluster of Gu gathered into a mass, shimmering with a dark golden luster, directly piercing through a long section of the city wall, battering and gnawing it into a honeycomb.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi raised his staff high, the patterns on his official uniform suddenly shining, and proclaimed: “The king’s command is as solid as a mountain; all evils, disperse!”<br/>
<br/>
State Technique - National Might!<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi, being the imperial envoy, naturally had the nation’s power backing him, which made his combat strength formidable - far beyond what his Golden Core cultivation level would indicate.<br/>
<br/>
The national might, vast and majestic, swept away the Golden Silkworm Gu cluster.<br/>
<br/>
Crackling.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, a large number of Gu either self-detonated directly under the national might or fell to the ground, being suppressed thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi cleared out more than half of the Gu cluster, yet still remained radiant with vigor.<br/>
<br/>
State techniques consume the national power, and Zhao Xi’s own reserves of spiritual energy were not diminished in the slightest.<br/>
<br/>
Li Jiuqu’s face turned ashen, his venomous gaze fixed intently on Zhao Xi.<br/>
<br/>
The latter, with head held high and chest out, fearlessly stared at Li Jiuqu across the vast chaotic battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Zhao Xi bent over and vomited copiously.<br/>
<br/>
From his mouth, he expelled a large number of centipedes and maggots.<br/>
<br/>
Li Jiuqu snickered sinisterly, “I have never seen anyone who could hold a long gaze with me.”<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators around immediately came to offer support and healing.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi’s face turned deathly pale; while vomiting, he said in alarm, “What kind of method is this? How did I get caught by it?”<br/>
<br/>
Compared to Mu Lan’s bluffing strategy, Li Jiuqu’s method showed no aura whatsoever - not even the slightest hint.<br/>
<br/>
Bai Ling flapped his wings, flying in the higher skies; as he swept over the battlefield, he shook his wings, and countless white feathers, one after another, were as sharp as knives.<br/>
<br/>
A sky full of silver-white blade rain descended, slashing the city wall’s military banners and such into countless holes.<br/>
<br/>
“Waya.” Jia Wan raised an iron pot, cowering under the blade rain.<br/>
<br/>
Ding Bi took out a kitchen knife and brandished a flurry of snowy light.<br/>
<br/>
The snowy light illuminated the white feathers, cutting them into countless shattered fragments.<br/>
<br/>
“Disciple, light the fire and heat the pot!” Ding Bi commanded sharply.<br/>
<br/>
Jia Wan immediately complied, exclaiming with joy, “Alright, time to eat again!”<br/>
<br/>
This battlefield chef began to cook.<br/>
<br/>
Many Nascent Soul cultivators from the Thousand Peaks Forest initiated a terrifying offensive tide, but under Zhao Xi’s leadership, the Nascent Soul cultivators on the Two Note side defended actively.<br/>
<br/>
Song Ji made a move, scattering countless clear radiance.<br/>
<br/>
Mo Yecheng’s myna had grown larger, becoming a mount, allowing Mo Yecheng to ride it while flying above the battlefield. Mo Yecheng frequently cast spells, doing his utmost to rush to the aid of the city wall defenders of the Two Note Army.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the cultivators, there were also two types of heavy artillery playing a role.<br/>
<br/>
Northern Abyss Rapid Freezing Light!<br/>
<br/>
Death and Life Separation Fire!<br/>
<br/>
Facing such an offensive, the Nascent Soul cultivators mostly focused on evasion. After being enhanced by military strength, the might of these heavy artillery was quite formidable.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long sighed deeply.<br/>
<br/>
Once the order for the entire army to attack was issued, the situation on the battlefield underwent a dramatic change.<br/>
<br/>
However, although the allied forces of the Thousand Peaks Forest had launched a powerful offensive tide, the Two Note Army, relying on the strong city wall defenses, still held their ground.<br/>
<br/>
“It's time for us to make our appearance, Daoist Lu,” Lord Long said to Lu Hongtu beside him.<br/>
<br/>
The latter nodded slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long and Lu Hongtu simultaneously entered the battlefield!<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the morale of the Two Note Army’s army sank. Lord Long and Lu Hongtu had already proven their combat strength in the previous ambush.<br/>
<br/>
These two Nascent Soul-level powerhouses joining the battle also signified that the high command on the side of the Thousand Peaks Forest allied forces had almost all joined the fight!<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long’s body gradually swelled, his posture no longer hunched, his eyes radiating a fierce light, and he quickly became a robust middle-aged man.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu then took out the Six-Dong Sect’s treasured item for the sect - the Light Mountain Heavy Mist Diagram. Although the scroll had not been unfurled, it still emanated swirling mists, enveloping Lu Hongtu’s entire body.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long struck; his blows were powerful and heavy, every move ferocious, causing the Blue Sea Taoist soldiers to crumble, and the city wall collapsed one after another.<br/>
<br/>
Wherever Lu Hongtu went, the cultivators of the Two Note Army were drawn into the diagram, severing their internal and external communications.<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it.” Shuang Ling, suspended in mid-air and surrounded by various mechanical constructs that formed layers of defensive lines, spoke.<br/>
<br/>
The awkward part was that, in such a battle situation, she instead ended up being left unattended.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling had to devote most of her energy and divine sense to her mechanical puppet to entangle Xiang Yue. But in doing so, a formidable opponent like Lord Long, she could only watch helplessly, unable to intervene.<br/>
<br/>
“Zhao Xi, you are currently the supreme commander of the entire army. The enemy commander has already joined the battle, so why are you still sitting there?!” Shuang Ling transmitted her divine sense to Zhao Xi.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi immediately replied, “Shuang Ling, I am not fighting passively. I am merely of the Golden Core level, temporarily serving as a battalion commander with great responsibility. If something were to happen to me, jeopardizing the army’s morale, what would happen?”<br/>
<br/>
“That old bastard Lord Long - I don’t know what madness he’s been struck by, suddenly launching the entire army into an attack. I am neither crazy nor foolish, and would never recklessly risk myself!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling was extremely angry; she knew many of Zhao Xi’s background details. In a real contest of tactics and hidden cards, even if Zhao Xi were merely at the Golden Core level, he would still be enough to counter Lord Long or Xiang Yue in a short time.<br/>
<br/>
But Zhao Xi obviously did not possess the fighting spirit and determination, and had not personally joined the battle.<br/>
<br/>
With a sudden thought, Shuang Ling took the initiative to fly down into the main camp.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical constructs by her side also followed closely, guarding her successful landing.<br/>
<br/>
“Aunt.” Shuang Jing, having received the summoning of divine sense, immediately rushed to Shuang Ling’s side, “what are your orders?”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling’s face turned serious as she said, “Next, I will use my Nascent Soul and fully control the mechanical Rougu Xuanji.”<br/>
<br/>
“During this period, my physical body will be unconscious, so I need you to guard it personally!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing responded with an “ah”; though surprised, she still nodded, “Aunt, with the White Jade Battalion, I will surely fight to the last soldier and must protect your physical body!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling forced a smile, patting Shuang Jing on the shoulder, “The situation is complicated; the only one I truly trust is you.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing then immediately led the White Jade Battalion to fall back to the second line to guard Shuang Ling.<br/>
<br/>
Alone in a building, though guarded by Shuang Jing and the White Jade Battalion, the ingenious princess still did not let down her guard.<br/>
<br/>
Before meditating, she arranged a three-layer defensive formation array around herself, activated protective talisman runes, and placed all sorts of handy magical treasures in the places where they could be taken at the fastest moment.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling successfully cast the spell; her head bowed down, her Nascent Soul flew out of her physical body, and immediately, through the formation array, was transmitted into the body of Rougu Xuanji, her mechanical puppet.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Rougu Xuanji let out a coquettish shout, and her movements became twice as agile as before.<br/>
<br/>
She employed her mechanical art, first using softness to overcome hardness to nullify yet another fierce attack from Xiang Yue, and then stamped both palms on Xiang Yue’s chest, directly knocking him down to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Boom.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue, whose body was enormous, when he fell this time, immediately emitted a muffled thud and kicked up a large cloud of dust.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone turned their heads; upon seeing this scene, many cultivators of the Thousand Peaks Forest widened their eyes in disbelief.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Almost simultaneously, a long section of the city wall also collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
The instigator was none other than Lord Long!<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long looked back, cast a glance at the fallen Xiang Yue, and then charged into the military camp, where he stirred up a storm of blood and gore wherever he went.<br/>
<br/>
Although the generals of the Two Note Army fought valiantly, alas, due to the vast difference in strength, they were easily annihilated by Lord Long.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long’s performance greatly boosted the morale of the allied forces.<br/>
<br/>
Golden Core cultivators such as Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and others - whether fighting individually or leading armies - surged onto the battlefield like a tide.<br/>
<br/>
A large number of soldiers, like a mighty river, charged into the various gaps in the city wall, engaging in fierce fighting with the Two Note Army inside the camp.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Battalion upheld the Red Flower battle formation, the White Jade Battalion remained unyielding, and the Fire Cloud Battalion ascended into the skies, stirring up a rain of fire……<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the Thousand Peaks Forest side also had troops. Among them, the Iron Bone Army, disregarding sacrifice, charged into the city; the Shadow Assault Army, with each member wielding double-edged blades, launched ferocious and insidious attacks; the Xuan Wu Army unleashed various spells, with their magic bizarre and extraordinary……<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that Lord Long was hard to control, the ingenious princess made up her mind and executed the mechanical art - Soft Bone Formlessness!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, her mechanical body became as agile and free as willow branches and snake bodies, with every part of her becoming extremely supple.<br/>
<br/>
From her automaton body, waves of flexible qi emanated from within to the outside. These qi waves spread outward, enveloping everything along the way and crushing everything into pieces!<br/>
<br/>
After several rounds of combat with Xiang Yue, several of his fingers were crushed into pieces; even his elephant trunk was broken into two halves, with blood flowing incessantly as he suffered heavy injuries.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling repelled Xiang Yue but did not pursue the advantage.<br/>
<br/>
This was because Xiang Yue activated his divine ability, fully defended, and accelerated his recovery - it was by no means a battle that could be won quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Lord Long committed massive slaughter inside the city, and the agonized cries of his allies put tremendous pressure on Shuang Ling, forcing her to temporarily abandon Xiang Yue and turn around to come to the aid of, to stop Lord Long.<br/>
<br/>
However, over here, once Xiang Yue lost the suppression, he again regained his momentum, greatly increasing his threat and creating a great deal of slaughter.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling was forced to fight on two fronts, constantly putting out fires, and was exhausted by running around.<br/>
<br/>
“Zhao Xi! If you don’t take action soon, after I return, I’ll fight you to the death to bring you down from your position!” Shuang Ling was extremely enraged, completely turning ferocious.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi said, “Shuang Ling, I am not fighting passively. That Liu - lead the Three Generals Battalion to go stop Xiang Yue!”<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that the battle situation on his side was becoming tense everywhere, Zhao Xi also dared not be careless and hurriedly deployed the Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
“Let us go and deal with Xiang Yue?” Guan Hong squinted his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei, eager to try, said, “That would be great. I haven’t yet had a face-to-face confrontation with this guy Xiang Yue.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er smiled bitterly; he was now on Zhao Xi’s side, and although he knew this was an extremely poor mission, he gritted his teeth and intended to carry it out.<br/>
<br/>
After all, it was rare for someone in the high command to accept a half-blood like him.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion formed an iron bucket formation, enhancing the military strength on the three generals.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, wielding the Xuanhuang Sword, charged first toward Xiang Yue, and then was immediately sent flying back.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, spitting blood with three broken ribs, yet showed a pleased expression, “Xiang Yue has been weakened a lot; with the combined efforts of the three of us brothers, we can fight him!”<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong and Zhang Hei subsequently took action; although neither was even a match for Xiang Yue, they were still able to temporarily preserve their lives.<br/>
<br/>
“Three little rats, annoying.” Xiang Yue, entangled by the Three Generals, had his actions greatly restricted, which made him extremely displeased.<br/>
<br/>
As for the three generals - Liu, Guan, and Zhang - they went all out, not daring to be the slightest bit careless!<br/>
<br/>
It was because Xiang Yue could afford to make countless mistakes, but if Liu, Guan, or Zhang made even one error, they might die on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, an opportunity!” Sun Lingtong suddenly said.<br/>
<br/>
“Hmm, I see it,” Ning Zhuo also had been keeping an eye on the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
He saw the Demon Heart Cave Master enter the battle again.<br/>
<br/>
In this way, the Demon Heart Cave Master and his son, Lin You, were separated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had never forgotten his original intention for coming to the Two Note Army.<br/>
<br/>
That was to reclaim his mother’s relics!<br/>
<br/>
