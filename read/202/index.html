<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 202: Where Did the True Scripture Go?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Jiufan proactively suggested, "Fellow Daoists, why don't we go to my place for a cup of tea first?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"That sounds good," Zheng Danlian nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Jiufan looked at Zhu Xuanji, "Divine Constable, the previous alliance was made rather hastily. Why don't we discuss it over tea?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly, "Then I shall impose upon you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">........</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, surrounded by layers of floating clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact was pressed against his chest, slowly rotating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Under the effect of the magical artifact, a tornado formed within Ning Zhuo's Qi Sea in his middle dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The tornado swept up the surrounding mana, grinding and reducing it as it absorbed, eliminating a large amount of impurities and clearing away the mixed parts, leaving behind the purer essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo was currently at the peak of the eighth turn of the Qi Refining Stage, with a vast Qi Sea and an abundance of mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He continued to activate the magical artifact for a while, which finally made his middle dantian feel a bit lighter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Originally, he had ten parts of mana, but after purification, only six parts remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Of course, these six parts of mana were still mixed, just less so than before, and could still be further purified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"But this requires me to find another method. Relying solely on the Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact can only achieve this much," Ning Zhuo understood this well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The growth and purification of mana, corresponding to quantity and quality, was an unavoidable and constant issue in a cultivator's lifelong cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo cultivated the three seas of essence, qi, and spirit simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The situation in his Qi Sea was the best, with the Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact available for use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">For the Essence Sea and Divine Sea, he could only purify them by continuously consuming blood qi and divine sense, then using cultivation techniques to generate new blood qi and divine senseâ€”a cumbersome method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"I should buy some Pure One Pills," Ning Zhuo thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This type of pill was the most classic and popular for purifying cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It was effective for the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">No matter which of the three dantians it was, it could purify accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo practiced diligently for a while, feeling slightly irritable, and then stopped the three major cultivation techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He took out the Five Elements Ruler, dividing his Five Elements Mana into five separate streams, constantly practicing the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Since obtaining this technique, he had been practicing it the most among all his techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo's progress in this area was visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After practicing the technique for a while, Ning Zhuo returned to cultivating the three major techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">After several rounds, Ning Zhuo felt his body reach the limit of operating the techniques and finally stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He also stopped practicing the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique, put away the Floating Cloud Cloak, and concealed his true cultivation, showing only the appearance of a three-layer cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He left his residence, accompanied by four former deacon guards at the Foundation Establishment Stage, and headed to the Ning family estate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"I need to consult some ancient texts," Ning Zhuo arrived at the Secretary Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Ning family's library was open to the public, but the Secretary Pavilion was a higher level, accessible only to the family's elite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">At this moment, Ning Zhuo was certainly qualified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He entered the Secretary Pavilion and searched around, while the four Foundation Establishment guards showed knowing smiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Because Ning Zhuo was consulting texts related to dual cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Hahaha, Young Master Ning Zhuo is already sixteen years old."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Yes, he's growing from a boy to a man."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"However, I started reading these when I was eleven," the four Foundation Establishment cultivators communicated privately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo consulted for several hours, then walked out of the Secretary Pavilion with a frown and a thoughtful expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">On the way back to his residence, he sat in the carriage, deep in thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">After this consultation, he had a deeper understanding of dual cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"The most mainstream method of dual cultivation is the union of yin and yang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Men are yang, women are yin. The union of yin and yang generates the power of two elements, which can create life and enhance cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"But this method has significant drawbacks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"As Brother Sun said, using another's qi during cultivation leads to impure qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"If you don't want to affect your foundation and future, you must purify and remove the other's qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Thus, after dual cultivation, you need to purify and refine. Without good methods, the results of dual cultivation are not as good as solitary cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo also learned that the union of pure yang and pure yin yields the best results in dual cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">However, this means the other's qi deeply integrates into one's own, making it impossible to remove completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The best approach is to form a Dao companion with the partner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"No wonder so many people become Dao companions!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"But if one Dao companion dies, the other's cultivation will suffer greatly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The risk is too high!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"It's not worth it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo preferred solitary cultivation and would never exchange his pure yang for temporary rapid progress, leaving a huge hidden danger for the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"My previous dual cultivation was just a shallow union of yin and yang, without problems."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"The acquired qi can be completely removed with enough effort."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Additionally, dual cultivation with nature, the union of heaven and man, is a way with fewer foreign qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Cultivators absorb the qi of heaven and earth, the yang qi of the sun, and the yin qi of the moon, which is of this type.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Even the union of heaven and man requires self-purification."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Is there a way for me to dual cultivate with myself? This way, I wouldn't need purification afterward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo's idea was that if dual cultivation with others caused foreign qi issues, then dual cultivation with himself would eliminate the problem at the root, making purification unnecessary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">This was theoretically feasible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Because normal personal cultivation is "yang qi moves to generate yin, yin qi stills to form yang," achieving harmony of yin and yang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Men are primarily yang, with more yang qi than yin qi, using yang qi to generate yin qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Women are primarily yin, with more yin qi than yang qi, using yin qi to generate yang qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Is there a way to extract my own yin qi, place it in a mechanical component, let it operate through some method, and increase yin qi?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"When I need dual cultivation, I can extract this yin qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Since the yin qi originates from my body, it is one with me. Thus, after dual cultivation, no purification is needed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo instinctively thought of mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">It must be said that previous dual cultivation had given Ning Zhuo great inspiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Before, he wanted to create a Golden Core Stage mechanical body for Yuan Dasheng to help him break through in cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo had a rather enticing mechanical design ideaâ€”mechanical puppets that could help cultivators progress faster!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"I've already figured out the path for Yuan Dasheng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Using the blood and flesh voluntarily contributed by clan members, and Yuan Dasheng's ability to use the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, I can obtain a continuous supply of refined blood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"After purification, this refined blood becomes extra essence treasure for my cultivation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"As for dual cultivation..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo was still contemplating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The biggest technical challenge was how to make the yin qi grow on its own!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"I could create a puppet, refine its spirituality, and let it use its learned techniques to increase yin qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"If there's no suitable candidate to make into a puppet, I need to find a true scripture specifically for increasing yin qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"No,"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"I cultivate the three major techniques. If the puppet uses another method to increase yin qi, it won't be natural growth and will have the nature of another method."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"If I absorb too much, I still need to purify."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Unless..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"I create a fourth technique based on the three major techniques, specifically for increasing yin qi!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">At this thought, Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The method of cultivating the three dantians simultaneously was already extremely rare and precious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Based on his understanding of yin and yang and the three major techniques, it was impossible to create a fourth technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"This path is not feasible," Ning Zhuo sighed, continuing to immerse himself in thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Jiufan and Zhu Xuanji had already reached the third round of tea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Jiufan held a mechanical demon general in his hand, using it as a major bargaining chip, demanding Zhu Xuanji's promiseâ€”to protect the Ning family, even if they lost the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace, they needed to arrange for the Ning family to migrate to another Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Moreover, Ning Jiufan's wiser move was to involve the Zhou and Zheng families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Without mentioning the exchange of interests, Ning Jiufan hoped Zhu Xuanji would make the same promise to these two families!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Zhu Xuanji pondered for a long time, calculating the cost multiple times, and finally nodded with difficulty, agreeing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thus, the three Golden Core families were overjoyed and immediately signed a higher-level alliance with Zhu Xuanji!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zhu Xuanji paid a huge price but finally obtained the mechanical demon general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Offering this up will surely elevate my status in the Lava Immortal Palace, a qualitative leap!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Alas, I also took a big gamble!" Zhu Xuanji bet on himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">In this way, at the critical moment of competing for the Immortal Palace, he could gain strong support from the three families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Afterward, if he defeated the Fu family, he wouldn't need to arrange for the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families to migrate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The mechanical demon general looked fierce and rough on the outside, but its internal structure was precise and meticulous, like a human body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Due to severe damage in many places, the mechanism couldn't be activated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Therefore, Zhu Xuanji's next important task was to repair it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">When Zhu Xuanji finally got the mechanical demon general in his hands and carefully inspected it, his face changed drastically, sinking to the bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He stared at a piece of mechanical iron plate in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">A blood path diagram plate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"This mechanical diagram plate is smooth. There should have been a true scripture recorded here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Where did the true scripture go?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">A true scripture is written with true intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Compared to ordinary scriptures, it can perfectly convey the mysteries of the scripture and the author's intended meaning to others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Words and language are often vague and weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">But not with a true scripture!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Because a true scripture contains true intent, it will transfer itself when a more suitable vessel appears."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Let me see..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Zhu Xuanji used his innate talent eyes and activated the Tracing Origin Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">In the next moment, he saw a scene from the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The battlefield was in chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The mechanical demon general, under the control of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, charged through the demon beasts, fearless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Eventually, it was caught off guard, defeated, and fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit quickly retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The mechanical demon general became a war trophy, passing through many hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">But none of them could comprehend the true scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Until a young monkey touched the mechanical demon general while playing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The true scripture on the diagram plate was triggered and immediately transferred from the iron plate into the young monkey's body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Wait."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"This young monkey looks familiar!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Strange."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Why do I feel a vague sense of familiarity?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Zhu Xuanji's face showed a puzzled expression.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
