<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Cracks spiderwebbed across the prayer beads in his hand, but the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord didn't lower his gaze, didn't even glance at them, only quickening his twisting motions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">With his vast combat experience, he knew this was no time to hoard or lament his resources. Let them be spent! As long as he could overcome this trial, the rewards would be immeasurable, elevating his entire cultivation journey to new heights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">As the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord relentlessly squeezed the beads, they deteriorated further, shedding fine fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">In exchange, the whirlpool in the Branch of the Wangchuan River spun faster and grew stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Cold Abyss Ice Coffin, trapped at the vortex's center, was pelted with tiny ice crystals flung from its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Within the weakening Ice Coffin, the sealed Nether Dragon Scissors began to tremble faintly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">A fierce glint flashed in the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's eyes as he strained to sense it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">A wisp of black-gray Qi was drawn from the Nether Dragon Scissors, penetrating the Ice Coffin and escaping into the Branch of the Wangchuan River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The black-gray Qi suddenly expanded and elongated in mid-air, transforming into two coiling dragons, their scales and claws distinct, their manes and whiskers bristling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">They intertwined and clashed in the sky, unleashing a terrifying aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The sound of metal clashing against metal echoed through the heavens. The black-gray Dragon Qi instantly condensed into a delicate phantom of the Nether Dragon Scissors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The scissor phantom was three feet long, its entire form a semi-transparent dark gray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The handles were shaped like two Nether Dragons, their jaws wide open, fangs gripping the base of the blades. The curved blades were covered in fine, scale-like patterns, resembling a dragon's spine. A line of condensed, dark blue spectral light constantly flowed along the blade edges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The Nether Dragon Scissors' true form concealed its power perfectly, emitting not a trace of energy. It appeared ordinary, yet its power and utility were terrifying. It was with this national treasure that the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord secured victory in his battle against Yin Jiuzhu, his lifelong nemesis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The phantom's power originated from the Nether Dragon Scissors, likely only a ten-thousandth of its true strength. Unable to contain its energy, its aura leaked out, shocking Ning Zhuo and Luo Si to their cores!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Azure Iron Han Armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo tossed out a silver token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The token transformed, once again encasing him in Azure Iron Han Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Having previously crafted new Azure Iron Han Armor for Sun Lingtong, he naturally could create more for himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo was a steady and cautious man. During his time in White Paper Immortal City, he devoted his spare moments to crafting mechanical constructs, in addition to cultivating and investigating cases.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Beyond the Mechanical Golden Swallow, he had also forged several sets of Azure Iron Han Armor as backups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The primary constraint on his production had previously been his lack of Golden Cores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Now, he held far more than just one or two Golden Cores! With the aid of three Mechanism Platforms, which saved him immense time and effort, crafting the Azure Iron Han Armor was no longer a challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Azure Iron Han Armor spewed Separation Fire, and its Golden Wings erupted in a blinding platinum radiance. Ning Zhuo, like a startled fish, darted backward, desperately trying to widen the distance between himself and the Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Meanwhile, Luo Si was locked in a fierce battle with the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom remained motionless, suspended high in the Void. Its stillness only amplified the dread it inspired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The phantom's oppressive Qi nearly made Luo Si's scalp explode. He was forced to divide his attention, reserving some of his strength to counter any potential attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God roared, seizing this moment of distraction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Its iron fist accelerated abruptly, its power surging to mountain-shattering levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In this critical moment, Luo Si's arm blurred into several afterimages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Netherworld Ferrying Line!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Fishing Art - Nine Abyss Water-Draining Net!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">A semi-transparent fishing line stretched through the air, transforming into a vast net. The net expanded rapidly, engulfing the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The god's ferocious fist crashed into the net, its force continuously diffused and dispersed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The net sank deep into the god's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let out a low growl, its voice tinged with surprise and alarm. It sensed its Divine Power leaking away like water through the countless holes in the fishing net, draining steadily outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">This meant Luo Si had lost one of his two most relied-upon magic treasures, leaving him with only the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">While maintaining the net with all his might, Luo Si retrieved a makeshift fishing rod and line. He quickly reassembled the fishing rod, combining it with the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Hmph!" The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's Divine Power continued to drain, its form shrinking visibly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"This Divided Spirit's methods are rather limited," it sneered. After exhausting its initial strategies and finding itself unable to break free from the net, it immediately shifted tactics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God threw back its head and inhaled deeply!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">In an instant, vast quantities of Earth Lung Turbid Qi surged toward it like a rolling, smoky tide, pouring into its body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Its recently shrunken form rapidly expanded, inflating like a balloon until it regained its previous peak state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Seeing this, Luo Si's pupils constricted to pinpricks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He hadn't witnessed the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's earlier clashes with the Soul Formation-level experts. This was the first time Luo Si had forced the creature to reveal its true capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"What terrifying regenerative power!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"And it can swiftly convert Earth Lung Turbid Qi into Divine Power?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"This is... a Nature God?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Gods come in countless forms, each categorized by their source of power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Many gods require incense offerings, worship, and the absorption of emotions to generate Divine Power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">But there exists a rare class of gods - Nature Gods - who can effortlessly draw power from natural elements and convert it into Divine Power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Logically, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, being a Soul Cultivator, should have a Divided Spirit of the Incense God type. Yet the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God turned out to be a Nature God!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Clearly, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had obtained a unique opportunity, allowing him to forge a Divided Spirit with superior advantages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Luo Si cursed inwardly. His lack of intelligence had backfired; he had aimed for a war of attrition, investing a precious treasure only to achieve minimal results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Luo Si reached out, attempting to retrieve the fishing net.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">But the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God refused to relinquish its grip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Its divine form shuddered, releasing torrents of Earth Lung Turbid Qi like surging bubbles. The turbid qi seeped through the net's countless meshes, enveloping the fishing net within its divine form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Luo Si immediately felt his connection to the net weaken. His retrieval force proved insufficient to resist, and the attempt failed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">When it rains, it pours!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Lord Wangchuan's true form ceased gathering power and directly activated the Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Nether Dragon Silhouette whirled violently in mid-air, emitting a piercing shriek! It ignored Ning Zhuo and Luo Si, instead following Lord Wangchuan's gaze to strike directly at the Path of Returning to Silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This temporary passage, created by the combined efforts of the Path of Returning Stillness Candle Body and the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale to carve through space, now faced a fatal blow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Lord Wangchuan's eyes turned glacial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo and Luo Si paled simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Lord Wangchuan's vast combat experience had led him to this unexpected yet critical move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The unconscious Qing Chi lay within the Curved Path. If the path were destroyed, Qing Chi would undoubtedly perish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Moreover, the Qing-Jiao Army had already retreated to the Black Cloud Battlefield and deployed their Ceremonial Barracks for encampment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Once the Curved Path collapsed, Luo Si would be cut off from his source of support, becoming like water without a source. He would no longer be able to draw upon the Qing-Jiao Army's endless military might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Reduced to his own strength and having lost the Netherworld Ferrying Line, Luo Si would inevitably be crushed by the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Qing Chi!!!" Ning Zhuo shouted, his divine sense transmitting his desperate cries, but Qing Chi remained unresponsive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Qing Yan sprinted through the passage at full speed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo lunged frantically toward Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">In that moment, he cast aside all thoughts of his injuries and the mortal danger he faced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Qing Chi had helped him immensely, and as the commander of the Qing-Jiao Army, though not a critical core member, she was absolutely indispensable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The new Azure Iron Han Armor instantly overloaded, the complete Golden Core within the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel hummed, frantically unleashing its Golden Core power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Sharp Metal Qi of the White Tiger Shattering Army Formation tore through the Void, while the propulsion force of the Li Fire Tongue Array was squeezed to its absolute limit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Combined with the Military Power Amplification from the Qing-Jiao Army, Ning Zhuo transformed into a burning meteor, hurtling recklessly toward the entrance of the Curved Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Stop - !" Ning Zhuo roared, chasing after the Nether Dragon Silhouette!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Get out of my way!" Luo Si bellowed in response!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In a branch of the Wangchuan River, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord revealed a disdainful smirk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Though his condition was dire and his combat strength severely diminished, a single, perfectly aimed strike had completely overturned the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This exquisitely precise target selection was like a fatal poisoned dagger, poised to pierce the enemy's heart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"You won't succeed!" Luo Si roared, his voice cracking with desperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's colossal fist left him no choice. As a Great General commanding armies, he knew what mattered most. Ignoring his own safety, he hurled the fishing rod with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The rod erupted in a dark, ethereal glow, the line snapping taut in an instant. Though a makeshift substitute, it still possessed the power of a magic treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Fishing Art - Soul-Fixing Life-Snatching Hook!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook shot through the air like a blazing meteor, leaving a straight, luminous trail in its wake. The slender beam of light moved with astonishing speed, intercepting the Nether Dragon Silhouette's world-destroying trajectory mid-flight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"It's hooked!" Luo Si's spirit surged with renewed vigor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He gripped the rod with both hands, bracing himself against the terrifying force that surged back through the line. Allowing himself to be dragged along, he narrowly dodged the Turbid Filth God's crushing blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Gaining a temporary safe distance, he began reeling in the line with all his strength. The rod bent into an exaggerated arc, the line straining and groaning under the immense pressure, threatening to snap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook glowed brilliantly, its hook lodged precisely in the interlocking joints of the Nether Dragon Silhouette.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The stalemate lasted for a full three breaths!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">With a soft sound, the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook shattered instantly, exploding into countless fine fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The fishing rod snapped piece by piece, while the fishing line dissolved into a shower of dark, shimmering sparks high in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Pfft! Luo Si was struck as if by a mountain-sized hammer, violently coughing up a mouthful of Primordial Soul Blood. His Qi flickered like a candle flame in a raging storm, teetering on the brink of extinction!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Yet his desperate, all-out defense had not been in vain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">After destroying the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook, the unstoppable Nether Dragon Silhouette's forward momentum slowed by a full thirty percent, and its invincible sharpness visibly dulled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Inside the Azure Iron Han Armor, Ning Zhuo's eyes burned crimson. Seizing the opportunity created by Luo Si's life-risking obstruction, he pushed the armor's capabilities to their absolute limit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Cracks spiderwebbed across the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel, and the tips of the Golden Wings melted and warped from the intense friction with the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo transformed into a blazing comet of golden light and crimson flames, overtaking the Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom with a speed surpassing his own limits. He fearlessly plunged into the turbulent, unstable entrance of the Path of Returning to Silence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Though Qing Yan was closer, Ning Zhuo, pushing himself to his absolute limit, still managed to reach Qing Chi first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Qing Chi!" Ning Zhuo scooped her up, holding her tightly against his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The instant he embraced her, the Nether Dragon Silhouette, a split second late, struck the Path of Returning to Silence with its full destructive force!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's icy gaze pierced through the churning Branch of the Wangchuan River, a cruel smile curving his lips as he witnessed the scene. "I have won."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Nether Dragon Silhouette's dim yet still lethal blades, like the fangs of death, parted slightly and snapped shut with lightning speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Everyone seemed to hear the phantom sound of a swift snip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Then, the space at the entrance of the Path of Returning to Silence shattered like fragile ice struck by a massive boulder!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Countless pitch-black shards of space, radiating an aura of annihilation, shot out in all directions like razor-sharp blades, sweeping across the area!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Explosions erupted along the Curved Path in rapid succession, starting at one end and spreading to the other with unstoppable momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo, clutching Qing Chi, flew desperately onward, feeling the icy touch of death closing in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Turning back meant instant annihilation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">He fled for his life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The raging Spatial Storm relentlessly pursued him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Countless fragments of space, like the Grim Reaper's scythe, narrowly missed Ning Zhuo's sides, head, and feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Scratches appeared on the back of his Azure Iron Han Armor, rapidly widening into gaping holes that showered sparks and electric arcs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The damage to the Mechanical Battle Armor's surface grew worse with each frantic movement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo's heart sank into the abyss of despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">He couldn't possibly switch to a new set of Azure Iron Han Armor. Even a moment's pause would mean being swallowed by the Spatial Storm, his life extinguished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Even the simple act of retrieving the Mechanical Dragon had become an impossible luxury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"Take her away - !!!" A resolute figure flashed past Ning Zhuo, charging headfirst into the Spatial Storm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">It was Qing Yan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The Golden Core cultivator had known from the moment the passage collapsed that escaping the spatial turbulence was hopeless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">As he brushed past Ning Zhuo, his eyes held no fear, only boundless love for his daughter and unwavering determination to protect her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">He positioned himself behind Ning Zhuo, facing the terrifying Spatial Storm head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">In the next instant, an unprecedented golden radiance erupted from his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Boom - !!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The self-detonation of a Golden Core cultivator, fueled by his life's accumulated cultivation, unleashed a violent surge within the chaotic Void!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The collision between this surge and the Spatial Storm created an even more chaotic and destructive chain reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The Spatial Storm's relentless advance was halted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Qing Yan's sacrifice had bought Ning Zhuo a final sliver of hope!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Father - !!!" A heart-wrenching cry of grief suddenly erupted from Ning Zhuo's arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Awakened by the violent tremors and energy shockwaves, Qing Chi opened her eyes just in time to witness the tragic spectacle of Qing Yan's self-detonation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The golden light illuminated her face, but what she saw was her father - the man who had always been taciturn yet silently protective, who had shaken his head helplessly at her stubbornness, who had stepped forward to shield her from danger, who had sighed in resignation and yielded during her tantrums and arguments...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Her father was gone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The piercing agony of losing her closest kin forever felt like a dagger through Qing Chi's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">She fainted again.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
