<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The bead string in the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's hand cracked and splintered, but he refused to look down, accelerating his movements instead. His extensive combat experience told him that he couldn't afford to spare any thought for this reserve power. If it was destroyed, so be it. As long as he survived this crisis, the rewards would be immense, elevating his entire cultivation career.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">As the Prefecture Lord relentlessly squeezed the power from the bead string, it crumbled further, shedding tiny fragments. In exchange, the whirlpool in the Branch of the Wangchuan River spun faster and grew stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Trapped at the heart of the whirlpool, the Cold Abyss Ice Coffin began shedding fine shards of ice. Within the weakening ice coffin, the Nether Dragon Scissors began to tremble faintly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">A fierce glint flashed in the Prefecture Lord's eyes as he strained to sense the connection. He drew a strand of dark gray qi from the Nether Dragon Scissors, piercing through the ice coffin and surging out into the Branch of the Wangchuan River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The dark gray qi suddenly expanded and solidified in mid-air, transforming into two dragon-like figures. Their scaled bodies and clawed limbs were clearly defined, their whiskers bristling with fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The two dragons clashed in mid-air, their collision releasing a terrifying aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The metallic clang echoed across the heavens as the dark gray dragon qi instantly condensed into the phantom image of a finely crafted pair of scissors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom stretched three feet long, its entire form a translucent, dark gray hue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The handles were shaped like two Nether Dragons, their gaping maws clamping down on the base of the blades. The blades themselves curved like dragon spines, covered in intricate, scale-like patterns. A thin, concentrated line of dark blue light flowed perpetually along their edges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The true form of the Nether Dragon Scissors concealed its immense power completely, appearing utterly ordinary. Yet its terrifying capabilities had allowed the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord to secure victory against his greatest enemy, Yin Jiuzhu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The phantom's power, likely only a ten-thousandth of the Nether Dragon Scissors' true might, radiated uncontrollably, leaving Ning Zhuo and Luo Si shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Black Iron Han Armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo tossed out a silver token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The token transformed, instantly enveloping him in a suit of Black Iron Han Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Having previously crafted a new suit for Sun Lingtong, he could now produce more as needed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo, steady and cautious by nature, had spent his days in White Paper Immortal City not only cultivating and investigating cases but also refining mechanical constructs. Beyond the Mechanical Golden Swallow, he had stockpiled several spare sets of Black Iron Han Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">What had previously limited his production was his scarcity of Golden Cores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Now, he possessed far more than just a few Golden Cores! With the aid of three Mechanism Platforms, he could manufacture Black Iron Han Armor with relative ease, saving him considerable time and energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Black Iron Han Armor spat out Separation Fire, while the Golden Wings erupted with blinding platinum light. Propelling Ning Zhuo backward like a startled fish, they swiftly distanced themselves from the Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Meanwhile, Luo Si was locked in a desperate battle with the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom remained motionless, suspended in the void. It was this very stillness that made it all the more menacing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The aura emanating from the phantom was so overwhelming that Luo Si's scalp felt like it was about to explode. He had to divide his spirit, maintaining constant vigilance and reserving strength to counter any sudden attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Roar!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Seizing the opportunity, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let out a guttural roar. His iron fist accelerated with terrifying speed, its power surging with enough force to shatter mountains and crush peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">At this critical moment, Luo Si's arm blurred into a series of afterimages as he unleashed:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Netherworld Ferrying Line!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Fishing Art - Nine Abyss Water-Draining Net!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">A translucent fishing line unfurled in the air, transforming into a vast net. The net expanded rapidly, enveloping the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The god's formidable fist struck the net, its power gradually diffused and dispersed as it penetrated the mesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The net embedded itself deeply into the god's divine form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let out a roar, filled with shock and horror. He felt his Divine Power seeping away like water through the countless mesh holes of the fishing net, continuously leaking and dissipating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">With this, Luo Si lost one of his two most relied-upon magic treasures, leaving him with only the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">While desperately maintaining the fishing net, he retrieved a replacement fishing rod and line, and reassembled his fishing setup with the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Hmph!" The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's Divine Power continued to leak away, and his form shrank accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"This Divided Spirit's methods are too limited," he thought. Having tried various tactics to break free from the fishing net without success, he immediately changed his strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God tilted his head back and drew in a massive breath!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In an instant, a torrent of Earth Lung Turbid Qi surged toward him, like billowing smoke, and poured into his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">His shrunken form rapidly inflated like a balloon, swiftly regaining its previous peak state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Witnessing this, Luo Si's pupils constricted to pinpoints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He hadn't witnessed the earlier clashes between the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God and several Transformation God-level experts. This was the first time since the battle began that he had forced the opponent to reveal such a method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"What terrifying regenerative power!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"And it can swiftly convert Earth Lung Turbid Qi into Divine Power?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Could this be... a Nature God?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Gods come in myriad forms, each with their own methods of power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Many gods require offerings, worship, and emotional devotion to convert into Divine Power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">However, a rare few, known as Nature Gods, can effortlessly transform natural elements into Divine Power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">By all logic, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, being a Soul Cultivator, should have a Divided Spirit akin to an Incense God. Yet, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God is actually a Nature God!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Clearly, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had secured a unique opportunity, crafting a Divided Spirit with superior capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Luo Si cursed inwardly. His lack of intelligence had cost him dearly. He had intended to wage a war of attrition, but despite sacrificing precious treasures, his efforts had yielded minimal results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Luo Si extended his hand, attempting to retract the fishing net.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But would the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God let him escape?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">With a tremor of his divine body, the god released surging waves of Earth Lung Turbid Qi. Like cascading foam, the qi seeped through the net's mesh, enveloping the net and merging it with his divine form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Luo Si immediately felt the connection between himself and the net weakening. His retrieval failed, overwhelmed by the opposing force!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Just as the roof leaks, it starts raining!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Lord Wangchuan's true form ceased to gather energy, directly activating the Nether Dragon Scissors Phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Nether Dragon Silhouette abruptly spiraled in mid-air, emitting a piercing shriek! Instead of targeting Ning Zhuo or Luo Si, it followed Lord Wangchuan's gaze, striking directly at the Path of Returning to Silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">This temporary passage, created by the collaborative efforts of the Path of Returning Stillness Candle Body and the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, now faced a fatal assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Lord Wangchuan's gaze turned icy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo and Luo Si paled simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Lord Wangchuan's combat experience was vast. Though this choice was unexpected, it struck directly at the crux of the battle situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Qing Chi, still unconscious, lay within the Curved Path. If the path were destroyed, she would undoubtedly perish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Moreover, the Qing-Jiao Army had already returned to their previous position on the Black Cloud Battlefield and established a Ceremonial Barracks. With the path destroyed, Luo Si would be cut off from his source of military might, unable to receive continuous reinforcements from the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Without their support and having lost the Netherworld Ferrying Line, Luo Si's remaining combat strength would be insufficient to withstand the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God. Defeat would be swift and inevitable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Qing Chi!!!" Ning Zhuo shouted, channeling his divine sense to try and rouse her, but it proved futile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Qing Yan was also speeding through the corridor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo yeeted himself wildly toward Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In that moment, he cast aside all pain and mortal danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Qing Chi had helped him so much, and as the commander of the Qing-Jiao Army, though not the linchpin of the operation, she was absolutely indispensable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The newly equipped Black Iron Han Armor instantly overloaded. The complete Golden Core within the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel began to hum, violently erupting with Golden Core power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Sharp Metal Qi of the White Tiger Shattering Army Formation tore through the air, while the propulsive force of the Li Fire Tongue Array was completely unleashed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Combined with the Military Power Amplification of the Qing-Jiao Army, Ning Zhuo became like a burning meteor hurtling recklessly toward the entrance of the Curved Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Stop!" Ning Zhuo roared, chasing after the Nether Dragon Silhouette!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Get out of my way!" Luo Si roared as well!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">In a tributary of the Wangchuan River, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord smirked with disdain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Though his condition was dire and his combat strength severely diminished, a single strike of his had completely overturned the battle situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">This brilliantly precise target choice was like a lethal poisoned blade, aimed to pierce the enemy's heart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Don't you dare succeed!" Luo Si roared, his voice splitting the soul at this critical moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He couldn't spare a thought for the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's colossal fist bearing down on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">As a Great General commanding armies, he knew all too well what was most important.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Without hesitation, he disregarded his own safety and threw the fishing rod with all his might!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The rod erupted with a dark radiance, instantly straightening the fishing line and rod. Though a substitute, it remained a magic treasure-grade artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Fishing Art - Soul-Stabilizing Life-Hooking Technique!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook was viciously cast, streaking through the air like a brilliant meteor, carving a razor-sharp line of light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This slender beam of light moved with astonishing speed, intercepting the Nether Dragon Silhouette mid-flight—the very force that threatened to destroy the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Hooked!" Luo Si's spirits soared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He gripped the fishing rod with both hands as a terrifying force surged back through it. Allowing the tug to pull him, he dodged the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's punch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Having gained a temporary safe distance, he reeled in with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">In an instant, the fishing rod bent into an exaggerated arc, the fishing line whistling as it strained under the brutal strain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook glimmered brightly, embedded in the interwoven joints of the Nether Dragon Silhouette!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The stalemate lasted for a full three breaths!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With a soft bang, the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook instantly exploded, disintegrating into countless fine particles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The fishing rod shattered into splinters, while the fishing line dissolved into a swirling cloud of dark sparks that scattered across the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Pfft! As if struck by a ten thousand-pound hammer, Luo Si coughed up a mouthful of Primordial Soul Blood. His Qi flickered like a candle flame in a gale, wavering on the brink of extinction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Yet his desperate, all-out sacrifice was not in vain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The unstoppable Nether Dragon Silhouette, after annihilating the Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook, saw its forward momentum halved, its invincible sharpness visibly dimmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Within the Black Iron Han Armor, Ning Zhuo's eyes blazed crimson. Seizing the opportunity created by Luo Si's self-sacrifice, he pushed the armor's capabilities to their absolute limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Cracks spiderwebbed across the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel. The Golden Wings, scorched by the intense friction with the air, melted at the tips and warped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo transformed into a comet streaking with golden light and crimson flames, surging forward with a speed that transcended his own limits. He charged recklessly into the unstable entrance of the Path of Returning to Silence, arriving ahead of even those closer to the exit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Though Qing Yan was closer, Ning Zhuo, fueled by his desperate speed, reached Qing Chi first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Qing Chi!" Ning Zhuo scooped her up and clutched her tightly to his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The moment he embraced her, the Nether Dragon Silhouette, arriving half a beat too late, unleashed its destructive force right into the entrance of the Path of Returning to Silence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, his icy gaze piercing through the turbulent Branch of the Wangchuan River, curled his lips into a cruel smirk as he watched. "I win."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The Nether Dragon Silhouette's dim yet lethal blades, like the fangs of death, parted slightly before snapping shut with deadly precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Crack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Everyone seemed to hear the phantom sound of the scissors snapping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Instantly, the space at the entrance of the Path of Returning to Silence exploded like fragile ice shattered by a boulder, sending countless pitch-black fragments of the Void, radiating destructive energy, hurtling outward in all directions like razor-sharp shrapnel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The explosions cascaded along the path, spreading with ear-splitting speed from one end to the other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo, cradling the thot in his arms as he fled, felt the icy touch of death closing in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Turning back meant certain annihilation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">He fled for his life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">A violent spatial storm chased relentlessly behind him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Countless fragments of space whirled past Ning Zhuo—like the reaper's scythe—missing him by hair's breadth, sweeping past his sides, overhead, and beneath his feet!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The back of his Black Iron Han Armor was repeatedly scratched, the wounds rapidly expanding with sparks and arcs of electricity flying!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The surface of his Mechanical Battle Armor tore wider with each desperate flight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo's heart plummeted into the abyss of despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He couldn't possibly switch to a new Black Iron Han Armor now. Even a moment's pause would mean being swept into the spatial storm, his life and cultivation destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Even the small act of retrieving the Mechanical Dragon had become a hopeless wish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Take her and go!" A resolute figure crossed paths with Ning Zhuo, charging toward the spatial storm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">It was Qing Yan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Golden Core cultivator had known from the moment the passage collapsed that he stood no chance of escaping this spatial turbulence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">As they brushed past, there was no trace of fear in his eyes, only boundless love for his daughter and a resolve to protect her!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He positioned himself behind Ning Zhuo, facing the terrifying spatial storm head-on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">In the next instant, an unprecedented golden radiance erupted from his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Boom!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The self-destruction of a Golden Core cultivator, who had burned through his lifetime's cultivation, unleashed a violent wave through the chaotic spatial currents!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The wave collided with the spatial storm, creating an even more chaotic secondary explosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The spatial storm's advance was halted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Qing Yan sacrificed himself, buying Ning Zhuo his last sliver of hope!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Dad—!!!" A heart-wrenching cry of anguish suddenly tore through the air, coming from Ning Zhuo's arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Jolted awake by the violent turbulence and energy shock, Qing Chi opened her eyes just in time to witness her father's heroic self-destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The golden light illuminated her face, but what she saw was not the spectacle before her. She saw the father who had always been quiet but silently protected her—the father who shook his head helplessly when she was willful, who stepped forward to protect her when she was in danger, who sighed and yielded during their arguments when she threw a tantrum...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Her father was gone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The excruciating pain of losing her closest kin pierced her heart in that instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">She lost consciousness again.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
