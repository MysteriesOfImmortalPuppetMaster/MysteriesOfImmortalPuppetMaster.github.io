"Brother Yu!" Upon arriving at the entrance of the Zheng family estate, Zheng Jian personally came out to welcome Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
This was Ning Zhuo's first formal visit to the Zheng family.<br/>
<br/>
The reception was grand, with the main gate wide open—quite a rare honor for someone of Ning Zhuo's Qi Refinement stage.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Zheng Jian himself was tasked with the reception.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Zheng, to trouble you to receive me personally..." Ning Zhuo, stepping out of the carriage, expressed surprise upon seeing Zheng Jian, quickly followed by a deep sense of gratitude, feeling genuinely honored by such respect.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian, still not fully recovered from his injuries, was nearly covered in bandages.<br/>
<br/>
He laughed heartily, "Don’t let this fool you; my injuries have stabilized. How could a mere injury cause a Zheng family son to neglect a friend?" He continued, "Come, I'll take you to the artifact refinement room."<br/>
<br/>
After deepening their cooperation, the three families opened some of their facilities to each other: the Ning family’s talisman-making room, the Zhou family’s various formations, and the Zheng family’s artifact refinement room.<br/>
<br/>
The most popular by far was the Zhou family’s Ju San Ruyi Lingxi Array, which everyone who used it praised highly.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, it was so in demand that applicants had to be placed on a waiting list.<br/>
<br/>
Following closely was the Zheng family’s artifact refinement room.<br/>
<br/>
Both the Zheng and Zhou families’ facilities were superior even to those of the City Lord's mansion.<br/>
<br/>
When Lava Immortal City was first built, the Southern Bean Dynasty shouldered most of the cost, but the Zhou and Zheng families also made significant contributions.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, when the city was completed, these two families were allotted two of the best plots of land, each controlling one of the main formation pillars, giving them the best conditions in specific areas.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family enjoyed the most spacious formation setup, while the Zheng family benefited from the most abundant and high-quality ground flames, perfect for artifact refining.<br/>
<br/>
From a broader perspective, this was part of the power play between local forces and the central court.<br/>
<br/>
On the bustling streets, Yuan Dasheng walked with heavy steps, head down.<br/>
<br/>
As he bumped into passersby, he remained unmoved.<br/>
<br/>
Some people he knocked over grumbled but did not dare confront him, recognizing his imposing build and the aura of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
His blank expression and the air of deep sorrow around him made him seem unapproachable.<br/>
<br/>
Following Zheng Jian’s lead, Ning Zhuo entered an artifact refinement room.<br/>
<br/>
He looked around, impressed, and repeatedly exclaimed in admiration.<br/>
<br/>
The room was well-equipped with many tools he had only read about in books but had never seen in person.<br/>
<br/>
The development of the myriad arts of cultivation has reached a point where each profession is highly specialized, with significant differences between fields.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike ancient times, when the barriers to entry for various arts were relatively low and a single cultivator could use one furnace for both alchemy and artifact crafting, today's furnaces are specifically designed for either alchemy or artifact crafting, among other uses.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian handed over a jade slip. "Our Zheng family has a vast reserve of materials. Saying we have everything might be an exaggeration, but we certainly have much more than what's available on the market. You can use anything listed in this jade slip, Brother Ning."<br/>
<br/>
"According to our three-family contract, the materials used will be calculated based on market prices and included in each family's consumption share," Zheng Jian continued, taking out another jade slip. "These materials are from my personal share allocated by the family. You can use them as well, Brother Ning." This was a clear gesture of goodwill.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled and accepted it graciously. "Thank you, Brother Zheng."<br/>
<br/>
"If you're not busy, why don't you stay? I plan to use your family's artifact refining room to craft some mechanism parts," Ning Zhuo suggested. "Here are the design blueprints for the mechanism. Please take a look." Ning Zhuo handed over a jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian was delighted, understanding that Ning Zhuo had accepted his goodwill, and immediately reciprocated. "Brother Ning, considering you designed the mechanism fire monkeys, I won't pretend to know more about mechanisms than you. I'm honored to appreciate your new work." Zheng Jian eagerly took the jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
Though he wasn't particularly interested in mechanisms, the context of the Lava Immortal Palace and Ning Zhuo's previously demonstrated talent in mechanism design made this a must-see.<br/>
<br/>
He unfolded the slip and saw it was a design for a mechanism monkey.<br/>
<br/>
Upon closer inspection, he noticed it was designed for combat rather than harvesting fire persimmons.<br/>
<br/>
The more Zheng Jian looked, the more impressed he was, becoming completely absorbed in the blueprints.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, not bothering him further, went straight to a corner, picked up the tools, and began stoking the fire to ignite the furnace.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng had passed through the western gate of Lava Immortal City, heading towards the wild.<br/>
<br/>
The number of people around him quickly dwindled.<br/>
<br/>
Step by step, he walked into the wilderness west of Mount Lava, his tall and robust figure exuding a strong sense of loneliness and desolation.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, he stopped at a remote hillside, sitting there blankly, looking around at everything, watching the sky and the clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo exhaled deeply, carefully tilting his wrist to pour the melted silver into the mold.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian immediately stepped in, using a spell to guide the molten silver, quickly spreading it evenly and filling every corner of the mold.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo placed his hand on the wall to activate the formation.<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, a cold stream gushed from the ceiling, cooling the hot mold in an instant and freezing it into an ice block.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian waved his hand, dispersing the cold, and took out an oddly shaped mechanism part.<br/>
<br/>
This was the last piece.<br/>
<br/>
With the help of the Zheng family's artifact refining room and the assistance of Zheng Jian, a talented cultivator proficient in artifact refining, Ning Zhuo completed the crafting of all the mechanism parts.<br/>
<br/>
The time taken was far shorter than Ning Zhuo had initially planned.<br/>
<br/>
Next was the assembly and combination of these parts.<br/>
<br/>
Without any unexpected issues, the assembly went smoothly, resulting in an eight-foot-tall ape skeleton being unveiled before the two of them.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian exclaimed in admiration, "Just looking at this skeleton, there are over a hundred movable joints. The mechanism monkey made from this will be extremely flexible, but it will also greatly test the cultivator's ability to control it. Many people probably won't be able to fully utilize its capabilities."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo responded, "I designed this for myself. I intentionally made it this way to provide a lot of room for improvement in my ability to control mechanisms. Alright, next we need to set up the formations. After that, we'll install the formation disks and other components. Filling the body will come later."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian nodded, his face full of enthusiasm. "We'll follow your plan, Brother Ning. I'll just be your assistant."<br/>
<br/>
Despite his injuries, Zheng Jian insisted on being fully involved.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, this allowed him to observe Ning Zhuo's artifact crafting skills firsthand.<br/>
<br/>
On the other, it provided excellent training for himself, enhancing his own understanding of mechanisms.<br/>
<br/>
Two days and one night later, the work was completed.<br/>
<br/>
"Why not stay at my home for the night and leave in the morning?" Zheng Jian invited.<br/>
<br/>
Having participated in the entire process, he had gained a lot and experienced the excitement and fun of mechanism crafting.<br/>
<br/>
He said eagerly, "Brother Ning, I would love to chat with you through the night!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled wryly, pointing to Zheng Jian's body covered in bandages.<br/>
<br/>
The once-white bandages were now stained with blood and black soot in many places.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Zheng, you should take good care of your injuries. You've helped me immensely throughout this process, and for that, I'm deeply grateful. If I stay longer, your family might not be too pleased. We will have the chance to talk at length in the future!"<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian laughed heartily, "Alright, alright. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you."<br/>
<br/>
"In a few days, our three families will undertake a joint operation, and we need you to lead it. Those of us who are injured can't make it."<br/>
<br/>
Although the geniuses of the three families could still enter the Immortal Palace in spirit form, their physical injuries required their spirits to remain with their bodies during the recovery period.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, the new body might not grow correctly and might not perfectly match their spirits.<br/>
<br/>
This would cause many problems in their cultivation, reducing efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, these small setbacks could accumulate into significant, unacceptable losses.<br/>
<br/>
As night fell, Ning Zhuo left the Zheng family in a carriage. <br/>
<br/>
There was no curfew in Lava Immortal City, and Yuan Dasheng had also entered the city.<br/>
<br/>
Before Ning Zhuo reached the family estate, Yuan Dasheng had already stealthily returned to Ning Ze's residence, quietly awaiting Ning Zhuo's return.<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo had anticipated, the intense emotions would eventually dissipate.<br/>
<br/>
The more intense the emotions, the less sustainable they are.<br/>
<br/>
After sitting idly in the wilderness for two days and one night, Yuan Dasheng's emotions subsided like receding tides, and the reemerged spirit once again followed commands, acting according to orders.<br/>
<br/>
However, the sorrowful and mournful sentiments still lingered, like a heavy gray cloth draped over the spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Controlling Yuan Dasheng was no longer as obedient as before.<br/>
<br/>
"According to 'On Spirituality,' after the Ling Chang stage comes the Ling Dong stage. With ten percent spirituality, Yuan Dasheng has moved beyond the Ling Chang stage and entered the Ling Dong stage. So, is the so-called Ling Dong characterized by this uncontrollable activity? If emotions arise again, I will be unable to control it once more!" Such a disastrous experience was not something Ning Zhuo wanted to repeat.<br/>
<br/>
"There must be a way, and the Lava Immortal Palace must have a solution to this problem," Ning Zhuo mused.<br/>
<br/>
This issue had to be resolved quickly.<br/>
<br/>
"I can't just soul-enter the Immortal Palace without a valid reason; too many people are watching me. The best opportunity will be the upcoming joint action of the three families in a few days!"</div>
