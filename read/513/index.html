<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Ning Zhuo?" Lu Hongtu’s heart stirred, and he felt that the name was somewhat familiar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Immediately, he recalled the intelligence regarding Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo first came into his sight during the initial ambush battle. Before the ambush, the Thousand Peaks Forest faction had already learned of the ominous prophecy Ning Zhuo made before the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Because of this, Lu Hongtu devised his scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">After the ambush battle, in which both sides had their victories and defeats, the old stone monster, Shi Zhong, openly declared that he was very interested in Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Therefore, Lu Hongtu and the others did not set their sights on this mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, yet one who could produce a relatively accurate prophecy, an exotic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">However, although the old stone monster was active, repeatedly ambushing and plundering the convoys of the two national forces at the rear near the Green Forest Immortal City, he had never acted against Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The latest military intelligence Lu Hongtu received stated that Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan had become husband and wife.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At first, Lu Hongtu thought that this was false intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">But later, after obtaining more details and understanding many of the underlying facts, he realized that the intelligence was true.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">At that moment he exclaimed, "This Ning Zhuo really does have some luck!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Lu Hongtu knew that Ning Zhuo was his enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He also knew the true story behind the conflict between the Ning family and the Six Caves Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Although it was his own side that was at fault, in this world, strength mattered more than right or wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After some deliberation, Lu Hongtu immediately said to the two ghost cultivators before him, "Ning Zhuo, is it? He is also my enemy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Oh?" The white-robed ghost cultivator, Tian Shuang, voiced his doubt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Lu Hongtu then explained in detail, immediately drawing him closer to the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The black-robed ghost cultivator, Di Hui, said guardedly, "On Ning Zhuo, he took the life of one of our disciples from the Soul Devouring Sect. We must capture him alive and take him back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Lu Hongtu replied, "I have no intention of competing with you two."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"He is merely a Foundation Establishment minor cultivator; if he were at the Golden Core stage, I would have already acted and eliminated him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"To provoke the two of you to capture him alive, Ning Zhuo must be extremely lucky."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"However... this person is actually also the prey of the old stone monster."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"If you two wish to capture him alive and take him away, you’d best obtain the old stone monster’s consent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Tian Shuang immediately shook his head, "Impossible, the old stone monster is only interested in him, while we bear a grudge against him for killing our fellow sect members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"For this matter, the old stone monster should yield for us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Di Hui even shrugged, speaking in a nonchalant tone, "I feel that you are placing too much importance on the old stone monster. Although he possesses the Earthwalking Art and can freely traverse the battlefield, he has never shown any remarkable performance in direct combat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Such a demonic cultivator is of little use. It is quite possible that by the next battle, the enemy forces will have already prepared measures to counter his Earthwalking Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Upon hearing this, Lu Hongtu was slightly astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He subconsciously turned his gaze toward Lord Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Lord Long smiled at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Lu Hongtu immediately understood —the information that the old stone monster was of the Soul Formation Level was deliberately concealed from the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth by Lord Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In fact, this military intelligence was known only to the top echelon of the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Had the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth known that the old stone monster was of the Soul Formation Level, their attitude would have been entirely different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">After some thought, Lu Hongtu understood Lord Long’s intention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"It seems that the Ginseng Beard Dragon King side intends to provoke a conflict between the old stone monster and the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The old stone monster was a newly promoted Soul Formation Level cultivator, and although the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth were merely two Nascent Soul cultivators, both were true Immortals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Moreover, the divine abilities they had each mastered could combine to form an extremely powerful strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Because of this, the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth were renowned far and wide; even Lu Hongtu from the Thousand Peaks Forest had heard much about them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Even if the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth are not a match for the old stone monster, let us not forget that behind them is the Soul Devouring Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"This time, Ginseng Beard Dragon King Temple has employed the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth with a heavy price not only to counter Du Tiechuan’s Iron-Flow Flatland Military Strategy, but also with a hidden plan to manipulate the old stone monster."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the eyes of Lord Long and Lu Hongtu, the old stone monster had always been a native Soul Formation Level of the Thousand Peaks Forest, a natural demon who had once probed the earth veins of the Thousand Peaks Forest in an attempt to reveal them blatantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Therefore, the old stone monster posed a tremendous threat to the status of the Dragon King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">However, now that the two national armies were on the move, the GinSeng Beard Dragon King was also likely quite troubled; wanting to deal with the old stone monster but unable to act, he had no choice but to employ such measures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After Lu Hongtu grasped the intention of the Ginseng Beard Dragon King Temple side, he immediately chose to cooperate with Lord Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">After further discussion, Lord Long called over his servants to lead the two ghost cultivators out, to give them proper hospitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Lu Hongtu and Lord Long then found themselves alone in a room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Lu Hongtu respectfully said, "Lord Long, as of now, Du Tiechuan’s intentions are quite clear— he aims to end everything in one decisive blow!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Therefore, whether our side can withstand his Iron Flow Flatland Military Strategy is of utmost importance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Once we succeed, our morale will undoubtedly soar, our army will be unified, and we will hold a tremendous advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Lord Long sighed, "Du Tiechuan truly deserves his title as the top general of the two nations. If he proceeds gradually and engages in successive battles, with us holding the advantage of terrain, we will be able to continually bleed his army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Now that he has played this move, our side must respond. This time, employing the twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth has come at an extremely high cost."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Seeing that Lord Long also understood the key to this grand battle, Lu Hongtu continued, "Lord Long, based on my thoughts, perhaps we should again request that Young Master Xianxu take action."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"If Du Tiechuan is injured once more, the balance of victory in this grand battle will undoubtedly tip further in our favor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Lord Long sighed once more and shook his head slightly, "I have already exercised that method."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"But Young Master Shengxu is too greedy; his price this time is as high as fifty times the previous one! It is absolutely an outrageous demand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Fifty times?" Lu Hongtu was equally shocked, drawing a quiet breath in astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He then mused, "Is this quotation perhaps part of his negotiation strategy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Lord Long sighed, "Perhaps. Since Master Lu of the Great Cave has shown interest, why not have you go as an envoy to persuade Young Master Shengxu to take action once more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"I will offer you a lower price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Twenty times!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"If it exceeds this price, our side will find it impossible to pay."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Lu Hongtu accepted the order and withdrew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He wasted no time and immediately departed quietly. In a mountain courtyard, he met with Young Master Shengxu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Although both of them were at the Nascent Soul level, Young Master Shengxu’s strength far exceeded that of Lu Hongtu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Lu Hongtu adopted a humble attitude, "Young Master, I have come here today to make a request."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"The enemy is strong, and if we do not act swiftly, our army may fall into dire straits. Therefore, I wish to once again ask Young Master to take action to assassinate the enemy commander. If you could be a bit lenient with your fee, my Thousand Peaks Forest will do its utmost to repay you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Young Master Shengxu lay on a reclining chair, his face ashen and devoid of color, his eyes barely opening a slit as he looked at Lu Hongtu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">In a very weak voice, as if like a gentle drizzle in the wind, he said, "Master Lu... regarding the last matter, this young master successfully dealt a heavy blow to Du Tiechuan, but you did not lead your troops in time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"This time, if another assassination is to be carried out, must the price surge a hundredfold? I raised my price by fifty times, which is already half off."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Lu Hongtu then indicated that offering fifty times was indeed too much of a hardship; the military expenses were enormous every day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">If other materials could be used for offset, would that be feasible?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">If payment were made in installments to settle the debt, that would also be a more practical solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Young Master Shengxu sighed softly and said lightly, "Other materials for offset would be too troublesome. I generally only accept spirit stones; it is much more convenient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"I will never accept payment in installments."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"If your side is defeated in this battle, whom am I to collect the debt from?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"If you wish for me to act, it must be in one lump sum, and the funds must be received in advance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">After Young Master Shengxu finished speaking, he slumped on the reclining chair like a sheet of rice paper, his very breathing noticeably weakened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Lu Hongtu was astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Without witnessing it firsthand, it would be hard to imagine that such a person, usually extremely frail and even struggling to speak a sentence, could possess combat power capable of threatening a Soul Formation Level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Lu Hongtu, with no other choice, had to take his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">His persuasive ability was strong, but in front of Young Master Shengxu, he had no room to maneuver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">As the military strategist of the alliance, his time was extremely tight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Upon returning to Dragon King Pillar Mountain, he immediately held a secret meeting with a group of key figures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">An old man, dressed in a long robe woven with patterns of green pine, with a beard as green as pine needles, was the Qing Song Mountain Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A young and handsome man, wearing a crown of white jade, was the Bai Shi Mountain Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">There was also the Tie Lu Mountain Spirit with a pair of deer antlers, and the Zi Ying Mountain Spirit, who constantly emitted a purple light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"This time, in dealing with the Iron Flow Flatland Military Strategy, all of you are our main force. Any losses will be compensated by the alliance at double the amount," Lu Hongtu said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Qing Song Mountain Spirit stroked his beard in silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Bai Shi Mountain Spirit remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Tie Lu Mountain Spirit was very direct, "If it is just such a benefit, then I won’t do it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Zi Ying Mountain Spirit snorted coldly, revealing an attitude of disdain and derision towards Lu Hongtu’s offer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Lu Hongtu was undeterred; he smiled and said patiently, "Please, all of you, state your demands so that we can discuss them properly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">While the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance was actively preparing for battle, the final parade in Wooden Wheel Town was also underway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">On the tall parade stage, banners fluttered and swayed, rustling in the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Only Du Tiechuan stood proudly on the stage, constantly maintaining this gigantic magical artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In his sweeping view, one army after another advanced slowly, displaying a magnificent military formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Every single unit that had lasted until now was equipped with heavy armor, without exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The soldiers clad in heavy armor moved in unison, and the ground trembled slightly with every step they took.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The heavy armor, under the sunlight, reflected a cold metallic luster. The clashing and colliding of the armor plates produced sounds that blended with every step, continuous and awe-inspiring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The formidable armor, along with swords, spears, halberds, and other weapons, as well as shields and even heavily armored mounts, together formed torrents of steel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Among these, each army also had its own distinctions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The Red Flower Battalion’s red flag fluttered high, with soldiers standing upright. Half wore jade-steel heavy armor and the other half ordinary heavy armor, their morale united behind the vanguard led by Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The White Jade Battalion’s soldiers were outfitted splendidly, each heavy armor as white as snow, the surface of the armor smooth like a mirror. The soldiers all wielded long spears, their spearheads numerous and gleaming with a cold light. At first glance, the entire White Jade Battalion appeared like a moving white wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The Fire Cloud Battalion’s heavy armor was self-equipped; each piece of copper-red heavy armor was designed to be open and flamboyant, most conducive to the release of magical abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">In the Three Generals Battalion, the heavy armor was also half jade-steel and half ordinary heavy armor. The three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang rode at the forefront, and slightly behind, Ning Zhuo also rode a demonic horse of the Foundation Establishment level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Unlike his previous disheveled state, this time his expression was calm and composed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Since refining the Fire-Traveling Heart in the Temple, he had devoted himself entirely, hiding within the Embryonic Breath Spirit Ship, actively advancing the cultivation of his physical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">In the subsequent consecutive parades, he gradually overcame the increasing difficulties, adapting step by step until he became completely at ease, with progress that was extremely rapid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Seated on the horse, Ning Zhuo even began to daydream a little.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"With the grand battle imminent, exactly how much combat strength do I have at my disposal?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">First was Ning Zhuo’s own cultivation level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He specialized in the three supreme doctrines, cultivating essence, spiritual energy, and spirit simultaneously. His cultivation was at the early Foundation Establishment stage, having already surpassed the stage of Opening the Field Unhindered and entered the stage of Nourishing the Treasure Medicine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">His physical foundation had surged greatly recently, with a specific strength fully capable of resisting mortal soldiers and repelling a small portion of magical weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">His soul foundation had not seen much improvement since leaving the Fire Persimmon Immortal City; it remained at the normal standard of two hundred times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">In terms of talent, his early wisdom had not been further developed; his other innate talent remained shrouded in mystery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">After his inexplicably strong streak earlier, Ning Zhuo’s luck had returned to an ordinary level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"But my Five Elements Realm is at least at the level of a Grandmaster; I can found my own sect and create spells on the battlefield."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"The divine abilities include 'Life Hanging by a Thread' and 'Stone-Cast Earth Treasure.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">After some events, Ning Zhuo became even more cautious in using the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability, for once unleashed it would undoubtedly cause his combat power to surge greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">As for the Stone-Cast Earth Treasure divine ability, its specific effect was to transform all things under heaven into stone, then temper the stone with time, gradually turning it into a precious material. Since its effect was extremely slow and had little practical combat value, it was currently used mainly to cooperate with the Embryonic Breath Spirit Ship for physical cultivation, as well as a means to disguise as the old stone monster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Judging solely by what Ning Zhuo had mastered, his cultivation progress was astonishing. At the age of sixteen, he had reached the stage of Treasure Medicine Sprouting, leaving his peers far behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">His shortcomings in the physical aspect were largely compensated for, and he had also achieved a modest success in the realm of the soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">His innate talent was yet to be fully developed, but for now, it was sufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The changes in his luck made Ning Zhuo feel inexplicable. The typical young man was completely an amateur.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Although the two divine abilities were not the main battle abilities, their auxiliary functions were extremely strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Especially the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability, which had marvelous applications in daily interactions. It was just too marvelous, so Ning Zhuo had to conceal it to prevent himself from becoming a target of everyone's vigilance and attacks once discovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">As for the Stone-Cast Earth Treasure divine ability, although it was obtained easily and was not widely applied at present, it was an excellent tool for management and had a bright future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">In terms of cultivation realms, it was outstanding. This made Ning Zhuo’s magical techniques extremely diverse. Coupled with his top-tier Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual, Ning Zhuo’s long-range spellcasting capabilities were quite impressive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Compared to his long-range abilities, his close-combat skills were rather mediocre.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Previously, in the Thousand Medicines Sect, Ning Zhuo had compensated for his shortcomings in close-combat techniques. And with the recent rapid advancement of his physical foundation, he had compensated for that shortcoming a bit more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">But compared to his long-range abilities, the gap was truly more than just a little.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
