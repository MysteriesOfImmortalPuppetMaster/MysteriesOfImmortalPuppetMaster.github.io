<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 358: The Noble Scion of a Great Clan!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo sensed the situation turning dire and shifted into a defensive stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Frost Fist!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Han Zhou's left fist, carrying a bone-chilling cold, shot toward Ning Zhuo’s chest with lightning speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo quickly crossed his arms in front of him to block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">With a muffled sound, Ning Zhuo was forced several steps back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Although Ning Zhuo had blocked the punch, the force of Han Zhou’s fist still penetrated through his defense, and the bitter cold energy seeped into his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Bitter Cold Qi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Han Zhou pressed the attack, changing his stance and raising his left leg high, spinning into a powerful kick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Old Frost Leg!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The leg’s cutting wind aimed directly at Ning Zhuo’s face. Ning Zhuo narrowly dodged to the side, avoiding it by a hair’s breadth, but Han Zhou swiftly changed his move, and his right fist, like a bolt of lightning, struck Ning Zhuo’s ribs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo’s stance faltered, his frame suddenly loosened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">If it were before his special training, he would have likely started losing the fight at this point. However, after the recent intense training, Ning Zhuo steeled himself, gritting his teeth and maintaining his posture despite the impact, never allowing his defenses to fully collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Each of Han Zhou’s strikes was powerful, numbing Ning Zhuo’s arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Suddenly, Han Zhou ducked and swept his right leg.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Old Frost Leg!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The sweeping kick hit Ning Zhuo’s legs, knocking him off balance and sending him stumbling backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Seizing the opportunity, Han Zhou followed up with both fists, one aimed at Ning Zhuo’s face and the other at his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo managed to defend against the attack aimed at his head, but his chest took the full brunt of the blow, and he was sent flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo was thrown back nearly a dozen feet, but while in midair, he adjusted his posture. By the time he landed, his feet skidded across the ground, preventing him from being thrown to the floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Good strikes.” Ning Zhuo spat out a mouthful of blood, but still smiled at Han Zhou, praising him sincerely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Watching from the crowd, Lin Shanshan’s brows furrowed as she saw Ning Zhuo coughing up blood, her heart tightening with worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Sun Lingtong, also observing the battle, laughed teasingly: "Little Zhuo, you really need to train your martial arts harder."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">As a tough mentor, Sun Lingtong, a cultivator from the Void Sect, didn’t consider a bit of blood a big deal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Han Zhou, now walking slowly toward Ning Zhuo, shook his head in disappointment. "Fellow Daoist Ning, if this is the extent of your abilities, then the victor today will undoubtedly be me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Your close combat skills need work. This weakness is too obvious and will be exploited by others in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo nodded. "Brother Han Zhou, you are right. Close combat has been my training focus these past few days. It was even worse before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Thank you, Brother Han Zhou, for helping me refine my techniques.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"But now, I will use some of my real strength. Please be careful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Han Zhou's eyes lit up. "I’m ready. Show me what you've got!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In the next moment, Ning Zhuo pulled out six mechanical floating hands from his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The floating hands immediately flew into the air, circling Han Zhou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and began unleashing a barrage of five-element spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Flames, golden blades, vines, earth spikes, and water waves—he cast spell after spell, a violent barrage of magic converging in a dazzling display like the brilliant fireworks of a grand festival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The spectators were in an uproar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Who would've thought Ning Zhuo had such mastery over five-element spells? And he's so young!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Did he start training in spells from the moment he was born?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"No, these aren’t just simple five-element spells. He’s rotating them, making them interact, mutually reinforcing and counteracting each other, fully utilizing the power of each spell. What kind of technique is this that allows him to switch between elements so seamlessly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Even Lin Shanshan, who knew a little about Ning Zhuo, was now deeply shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Only now did she realize that on the first day of training, Ning Zhuo had held back a lot of his power in front of her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"So, is he going all out?" Lin Shanshan's eyes were locked on the young man in white, his focused, handsome face illuminated by the multicolored light of his spells, making him even more captivating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">For a moment, Ning Zhuo’s spell-casting figure was deeply etched into Lin Shanshan's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Not just her, but the audience was also amazed and began to remember Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"His hand-to-hand combat may be weak, but his spell mastery is truly profound!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"With this level of power, there's no way that cave number 281 is the limit for him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"He deserves a better cave dwelling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Wait, you seem to be forgetting something: Han Zhou’s bitter cold energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Ning Zhuo is only in the early stage of Foundation Establishment, while Han Zhou is in the late stage. As long as Han Zhou can hold out, Ning Zhuo won’t be able to outlast him in terms of spiritual power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Many spectators saw the situation clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Even though Ning Zhuo was pouring all his effort into casting spells, suppressing Han Zhou and forcing him to defend, this kind of relentless assault was consuming an enormous amount of his spiritual power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">With his early Foundation Establishment cultivation, Ning Zhuo’s reserves were no match for Han Zhou, who was in the late stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">As expected, as time passed, Ning Zhuo’s energy quickly waned, and his five-element barrage dwindled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Han Zhou, who had been enduring the onslaught, finally found an opportunity to strike back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">An intense cold aura erupted from Han Zhou’s body, greatly weakening the power of Ning Zhuo’s spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Like a sharp blade flying out from an icy wasteland, Han Zhou closed the distance to Ning Zhuo in an instant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Ah!” Lin Shanshan couldn’t help but cry out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The spectators around her also gasped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">However, Lin Bufan, watching from afar, saw Lin Shanshan’s reaction and felt a subtle sense of unease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The overwhelming bitter cold qi enveloped Ning Zhuo, as if he were trapped in an endless snowstorm. His entire body and mind were about to be frozen, and he could only watch as Han Zhou’s fingers thrust toward his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">If that strike landed, it would pierce through his skull, leaving him gravely injured or even on the brink of death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">But at the critical moment, Han Zhou deliberately shifted his strike, aiming instead for Ning Zhuo’s shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">However, his confident attack was suddenly deflected by a protective barrier of slick light that appeared around Ning Zhuo, causing Han Zhou to miss his target entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Slippery Oil Talisman!~</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This was a protective talisman given to Ning Zhuo by his elders, and it wasn’t just a one-time use item.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Sensing the danger Ning Zhuo was in, the talisman activated automatically, successfully shielding him from Han Zhou’s attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The crowd fell silent for a moment, then erupted into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Did I sense that correctly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"A Golden Core level talisman?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"With a defensive talisman like that, who can even threaten Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"If he had used that from the start, the fight would have been over already!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Some people were left speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">If Ning Zhuo had revealed the talisman at the beginning, the battle would have ended long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">No one would have thought Han Zhou stood a chance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Han Zhou, a beggar by birth and dressed in rags, relied solely on his techniques and skills. Even other cultivators with powerful artifacts would struggle to break through a Golden Core-level defensive talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Han Zhou, aware of his own limits, scanned Ning Zhuo and realized that the talisman had considerable durability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He sighed and voluntarily conceded the match.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo, however, responded, "I must apologize. I used a protective talisman from my elders, which was not my intention. But your strength, Brother Han Zhou, was such that I could no longer suppress the talisman from activating."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"This victory doesn’t belong to my own strength. How about we call this match a draw?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Han Zhou carefully examined Ning Zhuo’s sincerity but shook his head. “Victory is victory, and defeat is defeat. The talisman and artifacts you possess are part of your strength. It’s perfectly reasonable to rely on them for victory.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“I’ve lost this battle!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">With that, Han Zhou saluted, turned, and walked out of the arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“We won!” Lin Shanshan clenched her fists instinctively, her heart leaping with joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo, however, sighed, his excitement dimmed, and he too left the arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The spectators began discussing the match, many of whom were regulars on Little Contention Peak. They had already started evaluating Ning Zhuo’s combat abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"As expected of a noble scion of a great family, carrying a Golden Core-level talisman. Who could threaten him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Only someone like Lai Wuying might stand a chance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Ordinary cultivators wouldn’t be able to compete. His spell mastery alone was enough to injure Han Zhou."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Lin Bufan withdrew his gaze. As he left, he saw Lin Shanshan walking over to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“A Golden Core-level talisman... Ning family from Fire Persimmon Immortal City, is it?” Lin Bufan began to take Ning Zhuo seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Even though Ning Zhuo was a junior, his background was impressive. Carrying a Golden Core-level talisman showed he was well cared for and a focus of cultivation within his family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">If even Lin Bufan was now paying attention to Ning Zhuo, it was clear that others would take notice too.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Soon enough, news of Ning Zhuo spread throughout Myriad Medicine Valley. Everyone now knew there was a scion of a prestigious family with deep connections—someone not to be easily provoked!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
