<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Not opening it." Zhang Hei originally wanted to refuse, but his eyes were fixed on the Netherworld Black Soil, and for a moment, he couldn't move his gaze away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Guan Hong continued stroking his beard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Liu Er stared at the Primordial Yellow Mother Stone, coughed, and said, "Young friend Ning Zhuo has been thoughtful. To be honest, I was worrying about going to the battlefield soon but lacking a suitable weapon. This piece of Primordial Yellow Mother Stone is of Nascent Soul level and can be used as the main material for a weapon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily and directly stuffed the Primordial Yellow Mother Stone into Liu Er's hand: "General Liu, I heard that the court's master craftsman Jin Li was dispatched to Celestial City of Green Forest half a month ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"A mere precious material, giving it to General Liu to serve the country is making the best use of it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"This kid from the Ning family is a smooth talker!" Liu Er was greatly pleased inwardly, nodded slightly, and looked at Ning Zhuo with strong appreciation in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After accepting the precious material, he immediately promised: "Very well, young friend Ning Zhuo has the merit of presenting treasures. When we form the army, there will definitely be a position for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo was overjoyed, hurriedly cupped his hands, expressing that joining under the three generals was an honor for a junior like him, and that he could thus avenge his family. The three generals were all benefactors to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Since they were benefactors, he asked the other two generals to accept this token of gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Compared to Guan Hong, Zhang Hei was much more straightforward. He directly put away the Netherworld Black Soil and patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder forcefully: "Good lad, I, Zhang, owe you one. Let's drink together in the future!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Guan Hong squinted his eyes, put away the Blood Fiend Demon Stone, nodded to Ning Zhuo, and also recognized this junior of the Foundation Establishment stage in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo said: "Today, the three brothers of the Pear Garden have sworn an oath of brotherhood. It is a great honor for this junior to witness such an elegant event."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"The unity of the three generals is a blessing for the country."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Why not add joy upon joy today and go directly to Master Jin Li to order weapons?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Liu Er nodded: "That's fine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Thus, the three Golden Core cultivators took Ning Zhuo and quickly headed to the Weapon Refining Workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">When Jin Li saw these three precious materials, he carefully examined them, his eyes shining: "Good materials. Among Nascent Soul-level materials, their quality is excellent, top-notch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Such high praise made Liu, Guan, and Zhang glance at Ning Zhuo again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"You three are all at the Golden Core stage and want to join the army. According to the task assigned to me by the court, I am to craft a magic weapon for each of you free of charge," Jin Li said in a casual tone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Liu Er had already prepared and handed over a weapon blueprint for the "Primordial Yellow Sword."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Zhang Hei searched in his storage belt for a moment and also took out a pieceâ€”the Black Snake Spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">As for Guan Hong, he had no such plans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Jin Li then gave him a weapon catalog to choose from.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Guan Hong flipped through it once and selected the Blood Dragon Saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Jin Li carefully inquired about the three's usage habits and personally measured their palms, height, and other dimensions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">During the conversation, Jin Li specially asked: "The quality of these three precious materials is astonishing. Could you tell me their source?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Liu, Guan, and Zhang did not hide it and brought out Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Previously, Ning Zhuo couldn't get a word in; Jin Li was not only a Nascent Soul cultivator but also a grand craftsman of the Two Note Country, carrying his own pride.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">At this moment, learning that Ning Zhuo had taken out three precious materials of Nascent Soul level and given them away directly, he couldn't help but look at him in a new light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"From the Ning family of Lava Immortal City in the Southern Bean Country?" After Ning Zhuo introduced himself, Jin Li firmly remembered the Ning family in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In his view, to give such resources to a young Foundation Establishment cultivator traveling outside, the Ning family must have considerable strength and deep foundations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Jin Li spoke kindly to Ning Zhuo: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, if you have more precious materials of this quality, why not sell them to me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"I am a grand craftsman of the Two Note Country; I won't treat you unfairly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"I can buy your materials at a price 20% higher than the market."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo smiled: "To receive Master Jin's favor is a great honor for me. Your request, I will remember. If I intend to sell precious materials in the future, your place will definitely be my first choice!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Upon hearing this, Jin Li laughed heartily: "Young friend, since you say so, you must have more precious materials. Why not take them out and let me have a look."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo then took out several precious materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zhang Hei was very surprised when he saw them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Guan Hong squinted his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Liu Er felt more and more regretful in his heart: "This kid Ning Zhuo is so rich. He's only at the Foundation Establishment stage but carries so many Nascent Soul-level precious materials. I've rarely seen such a thing in my life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He thought again: "The Ning family must be a great clan. As a son of the Ning family, Ning Zhuo must have a high status. Traveling outside with such treasures, he must have a powerful protector or life-saving trump cards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Thinking of this, Liu Er couldn't help but slap his own head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">What was he thinking back then?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Having only three brothers sworn in the Pear Garden doesn't seem perfect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">It would have been great to include Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Liu Er thought: "If Ning Zhuo were the fourth brother, wouldn't I have gotten more than just a piece of Primordial Yellow Mother Stone?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Jin Li looked at these precious materials, his eyes shining, and tried to soften his tone, putting on a smile: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, let's make a deal. Can you sell all these to me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">As a grand craftsman, Jin Li naturally had a strong desire for high-quality precious materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Now, carrying a heavy responsibility, sent by the court to Celestial City of Green Forest to craft high-level weapons and magic treasures, he was even more eager for these high-end, high-quality precious materials, with a large demand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, selected only three items, and then cupped his hands to Grand Craftsman Jin Li. He explained that he was carrying these Nascent Soul-level precious materials not for his own use but to trade with another great power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"However, trading in Celestial City of Green Forest, especially trading with Master Jin, is an honor for my Ning family and especially for myself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"It's just that I need to keep some, so when I reach my destination, I have some goods to trade, making it easier to report back to the family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The excuse came naturally to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Liu, Guan, and Zhang heard this and nodded inwardly, finding it reasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Jin Li was even more certain that Ning Zhuo had powerful protective measures on him or was secretly accompanied by a protector.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Although he couldn't buy them all, which made Jin Li a bit regretful, having some was better than none.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">This unexpected surprise also made him happy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">In his joy, he said to Ning Zhuo: "Young friend, although we are meeting for the first time, I feel a connection with you. Why not go to my private treasury and choose a weapon to take with you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Jin Li wanted to form a good relationship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His purpose was simple: to do more and longer-term business with Ning Zhuo and the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo hurriedly cupped his hands, expressing his gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">For him, this was also an unexpected joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">With a wave of his hand, Jin Li caused a wall to recess and move aside, revealing a hidden door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Entering the hidden door, Ning Zhuo saw several shelves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Goodness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">On these shelves were various weapons: axes, halberds, hooks, spears, knives, forks, swords, and halberds, dazzling and almost all-encompassing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">But Ning Zhuo felt somewhat indifferent to these.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Although I have diligently practiced close combat in the Thousand Medicines Sect, I only practiced fists and kicks to make up for my shortcomings and didn't learn how to use weapons, let alone these long weapons."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"And on the battlefield, where life and death are at stake, I don't want to engage in close combat rashly. It's still safest to cast spells from a distance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In this way, the range of Ning Zhuo's selection narrowed sharply, from hundreds of items down to only three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The first was a drum, but the drumhead was not the usual leather but a thin layer of dark silver metal, engraved with many lightning talismans, called the Golden Thunder Drum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The second was a circular ring, constantly emitting a layer of dazzling golden light, called the Sharp Blade Ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The third was a half-person-high iron fan, with the fan surface made of leather, called the Iron Thorn Fan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo carefully examined the three weapons but was not very satisfied with any of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Golden Thunder Drum seemed like a magic weapon but was actually a weapon used to smash people. In the process of striking, it would activate the talismans on the drumhead, releasing strong electric currents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The Sharp Blade Ring and Iron Thorn Fan were both handheld. The former was used for cutting and was a strangely shaped dagger. The latter was similar to a staff, a medium weapon. When it hit the target, it would form iron spikes, piercing deeper into the enemy's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo didn't want to get into close combat on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Before that, he would retreat as much as possible, create distance, and avoid falling into such a predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Although he hadn't specifically studied military tactics, thanks to the foundation laid during his time at the Ning family school and the broad horizons brought by extensive reading, he knew that battlefield combat was quite different from individual duels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">One major difference was cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">On the battlefield, cooperation was paramount. With cooperation, individual cultivators must maximize strengths and avoid weaknesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"My current combat strength lies in the Five Elements realm and Five Elements spells."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Long-range attacks are my main fighting style."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"As for close combat, I need to rely on my comrades to shield me and avoid it as much as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This was also one of the reasons why Ning Zhuo chose Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei. These three Golden Core cultivators all had obvious physical prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Clearly, the three of them were adept at close combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo took the Iron Fan and left the treasury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Before parting, Jin Li specially gave Ning Zhuo a token and instructed: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, if you have any precious materials to sell, you can use this token to come directly to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo showed great joy, hurriedly thanked him, and carefully put the token away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Liu, Guan, and Zhang all showed varying degrees of envy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Anyone could see that the Iron Fan, a mere magic weapon, was far less valuable than a small token. Because this token, in a certain sense, represented a relationship with the Nascent Soul-level grand craftsman Jin Li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Seeing Ning Zhuo put the token away, Liu, Guan, and Zhang all realized that they could no longer treat Ning Zhuo as an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Not to mention anything else, just this relationship alone meant that if their weapons needed repairs in the future, it would be best to contact Jin Li again through Ning Zhuo and ask him to help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Liu Er took Guan Hong and Zhang Hei to the City Lord's Mansion and smoothly obtained three "Youji" General's seals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The City Lord's Mansion assigned their camp location to the west of the city and provided several hundred top-grade spirit stones, ordinary lumber, tents, and other supplies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">If they wanted to set up a decent camp, they had to spend their own money.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">These supplies were, of course, minimal and only symbolic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Liu Er sighed: "Next, we need to recruit soldiers. The camp must be decent; otherwise, if it's too shabby, it will be despised by the cultivators. At least, it should be better than the Red Flower Camp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Guan Hong stroked his beard in silence; he was only slightly richer than Liu Er. According to the normal standards of Golden Core cultivators, he was terribly poor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Zhang Hei then said: "I have considerable family wealth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">With their funds, Liu Er was finally able to purchase basic supplies and set up the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo also said: "I can sponsor a sum as well, to contribute my modest efforts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He first chose a hill as the camp's location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Being on higher ground was beneficial for observation and setting up detection formations, avoiding low-lying wetlands, and to some extent, preventing dampness and the spread of diseases.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Behind the hill was a small river. A natural water source could save a lot of daily expenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Although this was the rear area and relatively safe, Liu Er meticulously set up three formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The first was the Sky Light Reflection Formation, set up on the outermost area, used for detection and monitoring the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The second was the Iron Wall Copper Wall Formation, which, once activated, could raise iron walls and copper walls in a very short time, greatly boosting the defense of the entire wooden camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The third was the Seven Stars Chain Formation, which could connect all the cultivators in the camp. On one hand, it could be used for communication, very convenient. On the other hand, it could cooperate with many augmentation spells, distributing the power of the spells evenly to all personnel in the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">After setting up the three formations, they began constructing the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The camp was roughly circular, with the tents of the three generals in the center. Around them was the guard camp, currently empty. Whether Liu Er, Guan Hong, or Zhang Hei, they all joined the army alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Outside the guard camp were the tents of ordinary soldiers. Usually, they would be divided according to troop types. Currently, these were also empty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">After the camp was set up, they arranged wooden fences, cheval de frise, and other obstacles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">According to Liu Er's plan, he also wanted to dig a trench. But it would be somewhat embarrassing to do it himself. Anyway, being in the rear, it was relatively safe. So the trench digging was scheduled for later, waiting for the troops to be replenished, and then using them to dig.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">After the camp was mostly established, Zhang Hei and Ning Zhuo began to exert effort, posting notices in Celestial City of Green Forest, extensively promoting and recruiting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The response was very enthusiastic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Have you heard? The recruitment conditions of the Three Generals Camp actually allow all spoils of war to belong to the individual cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Yes! In this way, as we fight our way through the Thousand Peaks Forest and loot along the way, the gains are unimaginable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Even the Barbarian Demon Camp doesn't have such good conditions!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"But the three commanders are only at the Golden Core stage, not Nascent Soul level..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Compare it with the Red Flower Camp?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Well, thinking about it this way, the Three Generals Camp is indeed a good place!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">A large number of cultivators poured into the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The originally empty camp gradually had people moving around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Several days later, most of the camp was filled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Seeing that the time was ripe, Liu Er convened all the personnel to formally determine various subordinates and positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He proclaimed himself the Grand General, Guan Hong as the Second General, Zhang Hei as the Third General, and Ning Zhuo... as the Military Advisor and Strategist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Liu, Guan, and Zhang were acceptableâ€”they were at the Golden Core stage after all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">But Ning Zhuo was only at the Foundation Establishment stage; how could he become the Military Advisor and Strategist?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Such a position, on the surface, was second only to the three generals, but in actual authority, it vaguely equated with the Second and Third Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Some people were dissatisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">On the spot, many people made loud noises, questioning this appointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Liu Er's face darkened and was about to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo smiled and stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Wood Element â€”Tree World Advent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Within a few breaths, towering trees grew out, vines and branches like dragons and pythons, occupying the entire parade ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Countless cultivators were thrown off their feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Wood Element â€”Deadly Flowers Bloom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">In the next moment, on the vines and tree roots, a large number of flower buds began to grow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">These flower buds swelled in one breath. In the second breath, they all blossomed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The petals were extremely sharp, like countless blades, fluttering in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Occasionally brushing against the cultivators, they immediately left blood marks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Many cultivators hurriedly dodged, some propped up defenses, looking very embarrassed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ning Zhuo's face was expressionless, hands behind his back, standing on the command platform: "Now, who still opposes my position?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">He spoke softly, but under the effect of the spell, his voice clearly echoed throughout the field, reverberating in everyone's ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">For a moment, the noisy clamor of the people quieted down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Liu, Guan, and Zhang each changed their expressions, looking Ning Zhuo up and down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Liu Er gradually showed a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Guan Hong stroked his beard, his movements becoming gentle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Zhang Hei raised his head and burst into loud laughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">In the forest, many Foundation Establishment cultivators displayed their own means, hiding in tree trunks or standing on branches, looking back at Ning Zhuo with full of apprehension, no longer voicing any objections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">The Military Advisor and Strategist of the Three Generals Camp!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
