<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Not opening it." Zhang Hei originally wanted to refuse, but his eyes were fixed on the Netherworld Black Soil, and for a moment, he couldn't move his gaze away.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong continued stroking his beard.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er stared at the Primordial Yellow Mother Stone, coughed, and said, "Young friend Ning Zhuo has been thoughtful. To be honest, I was worrying about going to the battlefield soon but lacking a suitable weapon. This piece of Primordial Yellow Mother Stone is of Nascent Soul level and can be used as the main material for a weapon."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed heartily and directly stuffed the Primordial Yellow Mother Stone into Liu Er's hand: "General Liu, I heard that the court's master craftsman Jin Li was dispatched to Celestial City of Green Forest half a month ago."<br/>
<br/>
"A mere precious material, giving it to General Liu to serve the country is making the best use of it."<br/>
<br/>
"This kid from the Ning family is a smooth talker!" Liu Er was greatly pleased inwardly, nodded slightly, and looked at Ning Zhuo with strong appreciation in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
After accepting the precious material, he immediately promised: "Very well, young friend Ning Zhuo has the merit of presenting treasures. When we form the army, there will definitely be a position for you."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was overjoyed, hurriedly cupped his hands, expressing that joining under the three generals was an honor for a junior like him, and that he could thus avenge his family. The three generals were all benefactors to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Since they were benefactors, he asked the other two generals to accept this token of gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to Guan Hong, Zhang Hei was much more straightforward. He directly put away the Netherworld Black Soil and patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder forcefully: "Good lad, I, Zhang, owe you one. Let's drink together in the future!"<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong squinted his eyes, put away the Blood Fiend Demon Stone, nodded to Ning Zhuo, and also recognized this junior of the Foundation Establishment stage in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said: "Today, the three brothers of the Pear Garden have sworn an oath of brotherhood. It is a great honor for this junior to witness such an elegant event."<br/>
<br/>
"The unity of the three generals is a blessing for the country."<br/>
<br/>
"Why not add joy upon joy today and go directly to Master Jin Li to order weapons?"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er nodded: "That's fine."<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the three Golden Core cultivators took Ning Zhuo and quickly headed to the Weapon Refining Workshop.<br/>
<br/>
When Jin Li saw these three precious materials, he carefully examined them, his eyes shining: "Good materials. Among Nascent Soul-level materials, their quality is excellent, top-notch."<br/>
<br/>
Such high praise made Liu, Guan, and Zhang glance at Ning Zhuo again.<br/>
<br/>
"You three are all at the Golden Core stage and want to join the army. According to the task assigned to me by the court, I am to craft a magic weapon for each of you free of charge," Jin Li said in a casual tone.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er had already prepared and handed over a weapon blueprint for the "Primordial Yellow Sword."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei searched in his storage belt for a moment and also took out a piece‚Äîthe Black Snake Spear.<br/>
<br/>
As for Guan Hong, he had no such plans.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Li then gave him a weapon catalog to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong flipped through it once and selected the Blood Dragon Saber.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Li carefully inquired about the three's usage habits and personally measured their palms, height, and other dimensions.<br/>
<br/>
During the conversation, Jin Li specially asked: "The quality of these three precious materials is astonishing. Could you tell me their source?"<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang did not hide it and brought out Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Ning Zhuo couldn't get a word in; Jin Li was not only a Nascent Soul cultivator but also a grand craftsman of the Twin Rivers Country, carrying his own pride.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, learning that Ning Zhuo had taken out three precious materials of Nascent Soul level and given them away directly, he couldn't help but look at him in a new light.<br/>
<br/>
"From the Ning family of Lava Immortal City in the Southern Bean Country?" After Ning Zhuo introduced himself, Jin Li firmly remembered the Ning family in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
In his view, to give such resources to a young Foundation Establishment cultivator traveling outside, the Ning family must have considerable strength and deep foundations.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Li spoke kindly to Ning Zhuo: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, if you have more precious materials of this quality, why not sell them to me?"<br/>
<br/>
"I am a grand craftsman of the Twin Rivers Country; I won't treat you unfairly."<br/>
<br/>
"I can buy your materials at a price 20% higher than the market."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled: "To receive Master Jin's favor is a great honor for me. Your request, I will remember. If I intend to sell precious materials in the future, your place will definitely be my first choice!"<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing this, Jin Li laughed heartily: "Young friend, since you say so, you must have more precious materials. Why not take them out and let me have a look."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then took out several precious materials.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei was very surprised when he saw them.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong squinted his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er felt more and more regretful in his heart: "This kid Ning Zhuo is so rich. He's only at the Foundation Establishment stage but carries so many Nascent Soul-level precious materials. I've rarely seen such a thing in my life."<br/>
<br/>
He thought again: "The Ning family must be a great clan. As a son of the Ning family, Ning Zhuo must have a high status. Traveling outside with such treasures, he must have a powerful protector or life-saving trump cards."<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, Liu Er couldn't help but slap his own head.<br/>
<br/>
What was he thinking back then?<br/>
<br/>
Having only three brothers sworn in the Pear Garden doesn't seem perfect.<br/>
<br/>
It would have been great to include Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er thought: "If Ning Zhuo were the fourth brother, wouldn't I have gotten more than just a piece of Primordial Yellow Mother Stone?"<br/>
<br/>
Jin Li looked at these precious materials, his eyes shining, and tried to soften his tone, putting on a smile: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, let's make a deal. Can you sell all these to me?"<br/>
<br/>
As a grand craftsman, Jin Li naturally had a strong desire for high-quality precious materials.<br/>
<br/>
Now, carrying a heavy responsibility, sent by the court to Celestial City of Green Forest to craft high-level weapons and magic treasures, he was even more eager for these high-end, high-quality precious materials, with a large demand.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, selected only three items, and then cupped his hands to Grand Craftsman Jin Li. He explained that he was carrying these Nascent Soul-level precious materials not for his own use but to trade with another great power.<br/>
<br/>
"However, trading in Celestial City of Green Forest, especially trading with Master Jin, is an honor for my Ning family and especially for myself!"<br/>
<br/>
"It's just that I need to keep some, so when I reach my destination, I have some goods to trade, making it easier to report back to the family."<br/>
<br/>
The excuse came naturally to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang heard this and nodded inwardly, finding it reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Li was even more certain that Ning Zhuo had powerful protective measures on him or was secretly accompanied by a protector.<br/>
<br/>
Although he couldn't buy them all, which made Jin Li a bit regretful, having some was better than none.<br/>
<br/>
This unexpected surprise also made him happy.<br/>
<br/>
In his joy, he said to Ning Zhuo: "Young friend, although we are meeting for the first time, I feel a connection with you. Why not go to my private treasury and choose a weapon to take with you?"<br/>
<br/>
Jin Li wanted to form a good relationship.<br/>
<br/>
His purpose was simple: to do more and longer-term business with Ning Zhuo and the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly cupped his hands, expressing his gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
For him, this was also an unexpected joy.<br/>
<br/>
With a wave of his hand, Jin Li caused a wall to recess and move aside, revealing a hidden door.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the hidden door, Ning Zhuo saw several shelves.<br/>
<br/>
Goodness.<br/>
<br/>
On these shelves were various weapons: axes, halberds, hooks, spears, knives, forks, swords, and halberds, dazzling and almost all-encompassing.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo felt somewhat indifferent to these.<br/>
<br/>
"Although I have diligently practiced close combat in the Thousand Medicines Sect, I only practiced fists and kicks to make up for my shortcomings and didn't learn how to use weapons, let alone these long weapons."<br/>
<br/>
"And on the battlefield, where life and death are at stake, I don't want to engage in close combat rashly. It's still safest to cast spells from a distance."<br/>
<br/>
In this way, the range of Ning Zhuo's selection narrowed sharply, from hundreds of items down to only three.<br/>
<br/>
The first was a drum, but the drumhead was not the usual leather but a thin layer of dark silver metal, engraved with many lightning talismans, called the Golden Thunder Drum.<br/>
<br/>
The second was a circular ring, constantly emitting a layer of dazzling golden light, called the Sharp Blade Ring.<br/>
<br/>
The third was a half-person-high iron fan, with the fan surface made of leather, called the Iron Thorn Fan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully examined the three weapons but was not very satisfied with any of them.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Thunder Drum seemed like a magic weapon but was actually a weapon used to smash people. In the process of striking, it would activate the talismans on the drumhead, releasing strong electric currents.<br/>
<br/>
The Sharp Blade Ring and Iron Thorn Fan were both handheld. The former was used for cutting and was a strangely shaped dagger. The latter was similar to a staff, a medium weapon. When it hit the target, it would form iron spikes, piercing deeper into the enemy's body.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn't want to get into close combat on the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Before that, he would retreat as much as possible, create distance, and avoid falling into such a predicament.<br/>
<br/>
Although he hadn't specifically studied military tactics, thanks to the foundation laid during his time at the Ning family school and the broad horizons brought by extensive reading, he knew that battlefield combat was quite different from individual duels.<br/>
<br/>
One major difference was cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
On the battlefield, cooperation was paramount. With cooperation, individual cultivators must maximize strengths and avoid weaknesses.<br/>
<br/>
"My current combat strength lies in the Five Elements realm and Five Elements spells."<br/>
<br/>
"Long-range attacks are my main fighting style."<br/>
<br/>
"As for close combat, I need to rely on my comrades to shield me and avoid it as much as possible."<br/>
<br/>
This was also one of the reasons why Ning Zhuo chose Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei. These three Golden Core cultivators all had obvious physical prowess.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, the three of them were adept at close combat.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took the Iron Fan and left the treasury.<br/>
<br/>
Before parting, Jin Li specially gave Ning Zhuo a token and instructed: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, if you have any precious materials to sell, you can use this token to come directly to me."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo showed great joy, hurriedly thanked him, and carefully put the token away.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang all showed varying degrees of envy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone could see that the Iron Fan, a mere magic weapon, was far less valuable than a small token. Because this token, in a certain sense, represented a relationship with the Nascent Soul-level grand craftsman Jin Li.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo put the token away, Liu, Guan, and Zhang all realized that they could no longer treat Ning Zhuo as an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention anything else, just this relationship alone meant that if their weapons needed repairs in the future, it would be best to contact Jin Li again through Ning Zhuo and ask him to help.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er took Guan Hong and Zhang Hei to the City Lord's Mansion and smoothly obtained three "Youji" General's seals.<br/>
<br/>
The City Lord's Mansion assigned their camp location to the west of the city and provided several hundred top-grade spirit stones, ordinary lumber, tents, and other supplies.<br/>
<br/>
If they wanted to set up a decent camp, they had to spend their own money.<br/>
<br/>
These supplies were, of course, minimal and only symbolic.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er sighed: "Next, we need to recruit soldiers. The camp must be decent; otherwise, if it's too shabby, it will be despised by the cultivators. At least, it should be better than the Red Flower Camp."<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong stroked his beard in silence; he was only slightly richer than Liu Er. According to the normal standards of Golden Core cultivators, he was terribly poor.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei then said: "I have considerable family wealth."<br/>
<br/>
With their funds, Liu Er was finally able to purchase basic supplies and set up the camp.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also said: "I can sponsor a sum as well, to contribute my modest efforts."<br/>
<br/>
He first chose a hill as the camp's location.<br/>
<br/>
Being on higher ground was beneficial for observation and setting up detection formations, avoiding low-lying wetlands, and to some extent, preventing dampness and the spread of diseases.<br/>
<br/>
Behind the hill was a small river. A natural water source could save a lot of daily expenses.<br/>
<br/>
Although this was the rear area and relatively safe, Liu Er meticulously set up three formations.<br/>
<br/>
The first was the Sky Light Reflection Formation, set up on the outermost area, used for detection and monitoring the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
The second was the Iron Wall Copper Wall Formation, which, once activated, could raise iron walls and copper walls in a very short time, greatly boosting the defense of the entire wooden camp.<br/>
<br/>
The third was the Seven Stars Chain Formation, which could connect all the cultivators in the camp. On one hand, it could be used for communication, very convenient. On the other hand, it could cooperate with many augmentation spells, distributing the power of the spells evenly to all personnel in the camp.<br/>
<br/>
After setting up the three formations, they began constructing the camp.<br/>
<br/>
The camp was roughly circular, with the tents of the three generals in the center. Around them was the guard camp, currently empty. Whether Liu Er, Guan Hong, or Zhang Hei, they all joined the army alone.<br/>
<br/>
Outside the guard camp were the tents of ordinary soldiers. Usually, they would be divided according to troop types. Currently, these were also empty.<br/>
<br/>
After the camp was set up, they arranged wooden fences, cheval de frise, and other obstacles.<br/>
<br/>
According to Liu Er's plan, he also wanted to dig a trench. But it would be somewhat embarrassing to do it himself. Anyway, being in the rear, it was relatively safe. So the trench digging was scheduled for later, waiting for the troops to be replenished, and then using them to dig.<br/>
<br/>
After the camp was mostly established, Zhang Hei and Ning Zhuo began to exert effort, posting notices in Celestial City of Green Forest, extensively promoting and recruiting.<br/>
<br/>
The response was very enthusiastic.<br/>
<br/>
"Have you heard? The recruitment conditions of the Three Generals Camp actually allow all spoils of war to belong to the individual cultivators."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes! In this way, as we fight our way through the Thousand Peaks Forest and loot along the way, the gains are unimaginable."<br/>
<br/>
"Even the Barbarian Demon Camp doesn't have such good conditions!"<br/>
<br/>
"But the three commanders are only at the Golden Core stage, not Nascent Soul level..."<br/>
<br/>
"Compare it with the Red Flower Camp?"<br/>
<br/>
"Well, thinking about it this way, the Three Generals Camp is indeed a good place!"<br/>
<br/>
A large number of cultivators poured into the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The originally empty camp gradually had people moving around.<br/>
<br/>
Several days later, most of the camp was filled.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that the time was ripe, Liu Er convened all the personnel to formally determine various subordinates and positions.<br/>
<br/>
He proclaimed himself the Grand General, Guan Hong as the Second General, Zhang Hei as the Third General, and Ning Zhuo... as the Military Advisor and Strategist.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang were acceptable‚Äîthey were at the Golden Core stage after all.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo was only at the Foundation Establishment stage; how could he become the Military Advisor and Strategist?<br/>
<br/>
Such a position, on the surface, was second only to the three generals, but in actual authority, it vaguely equated with the Second and Third Generals.<br/>
<br/>
Some people were dissatisfied.<br/>
<br/>
On the spot, many people made loud noises, questioning this appointment.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er's face darkened and was about to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled and stood up.<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element ‚ÄîTree World Advent!<br/>
<br/>
Within a few breaths, towering trees grew out, vines and branches like dragons and pythons, occupying the entire parade ground.<br/>
<br/>
Countless cultivators were thrown off their feet.<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element ‚ÄîDeadly Flowers Bloom!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, on the vines and tree roots, a large number of flower buds began to grow.<br/>
<br/>
These flower buds swelled in one breath. In the second breath, they all blossomed.<br/>
<br/>
The petals were extremely sharp, like countless blades, fluttering in the air.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally brushing against the cultivators, they immediately left blood marks.<br/>
<br/>
Many cultivators hurriedly dodged, some propped up defenses, looking very embarrassed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face was expressionless, hands behind his back, standing on the command platform: "Now, who still opposes my position?"<br/>
<br/>
He spoke softly, but under the effect of the spell, his voice clearly echoed throughout the field, reverberating in everyone's ears.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the noisy clamor of the people quieted down.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang each changed their expressions, looking Ning Zhuo up and down.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er gradually showed a smile.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong stroked his beard, his movements becoming gentle.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei raised his head and burst into loud laughter.<br/>
<br/>
In the forest, many Foundation Establishment cultivators displayed their own means, hiding in tree trunks or standing on branches, looking back at Ning Zhuo with full of apprehension, no longer voicing any objections.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The Military Advisor and Strategist of the Three Generals Camp!</div>
