<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 263: I Am a Thief</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo licked his lips, his breath slightly quickening as he glanced at Zhu Xuanji, a hint of urgency in his gaze. "Lord Zhu, you hail from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, while I am a branch of the Ning family. My mother passed away when I was very young. My father left even earlier; I have never seen him. Even though I have an elder uncle, I am not close to him and have not received much care from him. My life has been difficult from childhood to adulthood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"You claim to observe and ensure the safety of the people, but you are merely a bystander. You have never experienced it yourself; you do not know that many times, I am not considering the righteous path or the wrong path, but rather where I can find my next meal. Those at the bottom can only focus on the present."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Many times, it is not a matter of choice for them; it is that they have no choice at all! Righteous path, wrong path? Heh, in their eyes, there may only ever be one road: the road to survival!" Ning Zhuo did not directly respond but effectively answered Zhu Xuanji's words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He lacked key information, so he could not question how Zhu Xuanji had come to suspect him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">It was akin to confessing without being asked! He did not test the waters or remain silent, as either could provoke Zhu Xuanji's dislike or anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo chose to play a passive defense, countering as needed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He deliberately spoke of his hardships to exploit Zhu Xuanji's temperament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">At the Fire Persimmon Festival, Zhu Xuanji's appearance had caught Ning Zhuo off guard, forcing him to take risks and gamble, leading to a narrow escape from disaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Afterward, Ning Zhuo reflected on his mistakeâ€”he had been too lacking in intelligence regarding Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">From that point on, he dedicated himself to gathering relevant information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">One learns from mistakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He would not make the same error again, for repeating it could mean the difference between life and death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">There is a saying that rings trueâ€”the ones who know you best are often your enemies!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhu Xuanji remained expressionless, but inwardly he sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He was moved! There are only wrong names, not wrong titles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He claimed to observe and ensure the safety of the people because, deep down, he harbored compassion for the lower classes and the weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo's words struck a soft spot in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Of course, he could tell that Ning Zhuo's mention of suffering and being forced into circumstances also carried an undertone of seeking understanding and testing Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zhu Xuanji felt a sense of comfort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">At least Ning Zhuo was speaking the truth and attempting to seek Zhu Xuanji's understanding, rather than outright denying or refuting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">How should one put it? Speaking with an intelligent person is a relief! Ning Zhuo's awareness of the situation further convinced Zhu Xuanji that this young man before him still had hope and could be won over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zhu Xuanji sighed softly, "Paths are forged by people walking them! Some paths are easy but wrong, while others are difficult yet correct. Just like Li Leifeng, who lived a hard and frugal life in his later years, yet because of this, he is so highly respected. In truth, everyone has a scale that constantly measures others and situations. Those who bear burdens and warm others are the ones who emit light. You have also been illuminated by this light! Li Leifeng has long pointed the way for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The strategy of showing weakness and empathy was effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">From Zhu Xuanji's tone, expression, and words, he did not detect any disgust or disdain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Yet the problem still existed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo did not know what clues Zhu Xuanji had grasped that led him to suspect and draw him in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">This was crucial; without knowing this, Ning Zhuo could only passively defend himself in this exchange, unable to take the initiative!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"This cannot continue," he thought. "In the end, I will be cornered with no room to maneuver. Rather than that, I might as well take some risks now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo had already foreseen his defeat and gritted his teeth, deciding to take a gamble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He spoke, "Li Leifeng is a model of righteousness; every time I think of him, I feel warmth. He makes me feel that this world is worth it. However, how many Li Leifengs are there in this world? How many people can bask in his light?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Yes, I have been cared for. I am fortunate, but I am also unfortunate. It is precisely because I have felt warmth that I understand the pain of coldness more deeply."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Pausing, Ning Zhuo looked at Zhu Xuanji, his eyes full of spirit. "Lord Zhu, people are different from one another. To me, Li Leifeng and you are both high above, figures on the stage. Whether genuine or feigned, it is all glamorous. Yet I am ultimately one below the stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Do you know what it feels like to sneak a bite of leftover pastries from those guests? You have to harden your heart and endure the disdainful and contemptuous gazes. You have to reach out and pick through the refuse of cups and plates. You will feel shame; this feeling is told to you by outsiders, but it also comes from deep within, succumbing to the cravings of the stomach. I am from the bottom; I have always been."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Though my surname is Ning, I never feel noble. I am despicable. I am a thief! I am someone who rummages through garbage to find food. I am from the bottom. Heh, perhaps saying this is a bit pretentious. But I truly believe this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Look, even as I grew up, I still meddled in the black market. I scavenge from places looked down upon by the righteous. I am not afraid of winning; I only fear not being full." Ning Zhuo exhaled a breath of turbid air, a sorrowful smile on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"I know there are people like Li Leifeng in this world. I admire him and am grateful. And you, Lord Zhu. I admire you. This is the truth!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"You are of the royal family, a divine constable, yet you have your own principles and always adhere to them. You are a gentleman, and you deserve your reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"However, I deeply understand that people are different from one another, starting from their origins. The paths of people are also different. No one can truly help me. People are lonely; one cannot fully understand another. Most of the time, I can only rely on myself. The path I walk is my own choice!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Xuanji fell into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">His heart felt heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo's words stirred emotions within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He understood many of Ning Zhuo's circumstances; although he focused on the Ning family's identity, he had not benefited much from it since childhood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhu Xuanji felt pity! He was like a drowning person, shouting for help, reaching out to be saved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Yet this drowning person wished to sink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Thus, Zhu Xuanji felt powerless, sorrowful, indignant, and frustrated! A young man like you, with such talent and potential, should not be so willing to fall!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Zhu Xuanji's gaze turned cold as he actively shifted the topic, "Ning Zhuo, you have seen the play 'Seeking Justice,' right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo replied, "I have seen it many times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhu Xuanji continued, "You are correct. The empathy between people is often just watching from the sidelines. At such times, we need to take action ourselves to try to feel."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Li Leifeng has performed 'Seeking Justice' for you many times. You always stood below the stage, thinking you were still that little thief sneaking bites. Not anymore! As of today, you are no longer the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"You are now a person on stage. Do you know that Li Leifeng also looks forward to you standing on stage? He once believed that you would shine from the age of six and gradually take the stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo's heart stirred slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Zhu Xuanji continued, "Li Leifeng has passed away; he did not see you shine in his lifetime, which is one of his regrets. Go and make up for this regret. Perform a play of 'Seeking Justice.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Try to stand in Li Leifeng's shoes and perform a puppet show, experiencing the situation and feelings he faced." Ning Zhuo hesitated, "This..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhu Xuanji's gaze deepened, "Don't tell me you lack the skill to control the puppets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo shook his head, "Of course not..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhu Xuanji asserted strongly, interrupting, "You may not realize, but he has given you many opportunities. I am also giving you an opportunity now. You should give yourself a chance. Go on stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Although Li Leifeng has passed away, I believe he still leaves light for you, to guide you onto the righteous path!" At this point, Ning Zhuo had already guessed that the flaw likely originated from Li Leifeng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">However, with the confrontation between him and Zhu Xuanji reaching this level, he was already cornered and had no way to refuse; he could only comply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Receiving Zhu Xuanji's telepathic message, Zhu Hou immediately made arrangements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The elder in charge took the stage to inform everyone that although donations had ended, a young genius was willing to perform a puppet show to entertain everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Thus, Ning Zhuo stepped onto the stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He bowed to the cultivators below and in the building, "Respected seniors, please allow me to present my humble offering. When I was young, my family was poor, and life was difficult. I was fortunate to receive care from Lord Li Leifeng on many occasions. He never asked for anything in return, only wishing to help others. His character and virtue are truly admirable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"I have watched the elder's puppet shows countless times; they are extraordinarily wonderful. Now, I am fortunate to have learned some of the skills. Today, I present this puppet show in memory of Lord Li Leifeng and to celebrate Lord Zhu's succession." The sounds of drums and cheers erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The cultivators felt surprised and delighted, and the atmosphere in the building grew warm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Before the golden core chaos, Ning Zhuo's reputation had only spread within a small circle among the four major forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Ning family was familiar with him, as he had pulled Ning Xiaohui down from power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After the golden core chaos, due to rumors and other factors, Ning Zhuo became widely known.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This time, Zhu Xuanji brought him to participate in this ceremony, leaving a deep impression on everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Almost everyone speculated that Ning Zhuo had caught Zhu Xuanji's eye and was now riding on his coattails.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Because of Zhu Xuanji, Ning Zhuo was given even more attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Now, this rising star of the righteous path personally took the stage to perform a puppet show, drawing great interest from the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Regardless of how the performance went, many had already formed the thought in their heartsâ€”after the show, they would add to their donations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After all, supporting Ning Zhuo meant supporting Zhu Xuanji!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Those of the righteous path were quite aware of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
