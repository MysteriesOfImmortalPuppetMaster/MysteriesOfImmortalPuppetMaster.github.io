<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Elder Sun, Elder Sun, please don't be angry, listen to my explanation." In the black market, a grey-robed cultivator cupped his fists, apologizing repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Last time, introduced by Yu Heye, Sun Lingtong had conducted his first transaction with this grey-robed cultivator, buying up every single Soul the man was selling at the time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Not only that, Sun Lingtong had also placed an order with the grey-robed cultivator for the Soul of Qin De.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Although Qin De was a Confucian cultivator, he had walked the Demonic Path and had been imprisoned in the Cloud Prison of the Demon Subduing Hall for many years. It was quite normal for one to be unable to endure it, resulting in death and the dissipation of their Dao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">At that time, the grey-robed cultivator had quoted a price of five hundred thousand mid-grade Spirit Stones. Sun Lingtong not only agreed but also gave two Ghost Path Golden Cores as both a deposit and a deterrent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The grey-robed cultivator said, "I sincerely wanted to do this business, Elder Sun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"But since we parted ways last time, I went to the Demon Subduing Hall to try and maneuver things, only to discover that the supervision of Qin De has become extremely strict!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"It’s truly strange. In the last dozen years, almost no one cared about this guy. Why would he suddenly receive such 'attention'?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lingtong’s face was as dark as water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">With his expectations dashed, he was naturally in a bad mood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He had always been interested in Qin De, especially the Sage Great Thief Sutra created by him. It had touched Sun Lingtong’s heart the moment he heard of it, feeling like it would be a fateful opportunity for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Therefore, Sun Lingtong did not hesitate to acquire Qin De's Soul at a high price for Ning Zhuo to use. Not only would it allow Ning Zhuo to gain the experience and memories of a Confucian cultivator, but he would also obtain the Sage Great Thief Sutra. It would be killing two birds with one stone, a double victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Sun Lingtong stared at the grey-robed cultivator: "Do you think I care about these circumstances? The deal wasn't completed, you have to compensate me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The grey-robed cultivator sighed deeply. He took out the two Ghost Path Golden Cores from his bosom, his gaze reluctant and lingering, but eventually, he placed them back into Sun Lingtong's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong first inspected the goods. Only after confirming they were correct did he put away the two Ghost Path Golden Cores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Seeing him use five or six different methods of inspection in rapid succession with extreme proficiency, the grey-robed cultivator immediately smelled the scent of a black market peer, and a bad feeling grew in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The next moment, Sun Lingtong sneered at him: "This account isn't right, is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The grey-robed cultivator’s heart skipped a beat: "Two Golden Cores, returned in full. How is it not right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sun Lingtong laughed coldly: "Do you take me for someone who doesn't know the rules of the black market? You asked for a high price, and I agreed immediately without even bargaining. Now, you tell me the deal is off after wasting so much of my time. Shouldn't you pay for this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Sun Lingtong wasn't just a "black market peer"; he managed the black market in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and was very clear about the tricks inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">In the black market, the reputation and credibility of a long-term seller were extremely important, even more important than their life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">It seemed strange and ironic, but that was the reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">It was hard to find trust between Heretical Sects and the Demonic Path, yet trust was the foundation of business. Doing a one-off deal was one thing, but if one wanted to do long-term business, one had to maintain their signboard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The grey-robed cultivator had been doing business in the black market for a long time, so he naturally protected his reputation fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Facing Sun Lingtong’s demand for compensation, he immediately lowered his voice and spoke fiercely: "Heh, I was wondering if this was a setup you intentionally laid to trap me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"How could this Qin De suddenly be under strict guard at this specific time?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Sun Lingtong sneered: "You want to renege on the debt? Are you sure?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"As soon as you nod, I will shout out loud right now and publicize the fact that you messed up and are trying to deny it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Of course, it won't just be that. I will also spread this news outside!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Just watch. If I don't ruin your business, my surname isn't Sun!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The grey-robed cultivator also grunted coldly: "I never show my true face. At worst, I'll avoid the wind for a while, change my identity, and come back to sell goods!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Sun Lingtong: "Hehe, have you thought it through? Then I'm shouting!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Seeing Sun Lingtong really opening his mouth wide, the grey-robed cultivator’s heartstrings tightened to the breaking point. Finally, he couldn't hold on: "Wait, wait."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He seemed to deflate: "Name a price. How much do you want me to pay? Let me say this beforehand, if you open your mouth like a lion, I'd rather start over from scratch!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Sun Lingtong was also quite seasoned in negotiations. Having achieved a temporary victory, he didn't continue to push too hard: "I want to know about Qin De. Don't give me any other nonsense, give me some solid information that others don't know."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The grey-robed cultivator was slightly stunned. He re-examined the cultivator in front of him and suddenly realized that the other party truly wanted to close this deal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">His emotions immediately softened a lot, and he recounted the relevant intelligence, more detailed and truthful than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He complained: "I spent a lot of money trying to grease the wheels, but I discovered with despair: it turned out the order came from the very top!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong was surprised and confirmed: "Demon Subjugation Hall Master Zhong Dao?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The grey-robed cultivator nodded: "Precisely!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"It is said that the leader of the Confucian cultivator group, Duanmu Zhang, is good friends with Zhong Dao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I suspect it might be due to this relationship that the Confucian cultivator group heard some rumors, which influenced Hall Master Zhong Dao to do this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Speaking of this, he looked at Sun Lingtong again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Sun Lingtong snorted coldly: "Don't look at me with suspicious eyes. How could I possibly leak this transaction?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He frowned deeply and sighed heavily, wondering what Zhong Dao was up to. Under these circumstances, getting Qin De's Soul was almost a fantasy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He would never have guessed that this complication stemmed from the recent Eight Peaks Discussion and was closely related to White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"When can you get Qin De's Soul?" Sun Lingtong asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The grey-robed cultivator found it strange: "You want it that much?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Sun Lingtong: "To be accurate, I want any Confucian cultivator's Soul. But isn't Qin De the only option you have here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The grey-robed cultivator immediately became alert: "Although I do business in the black market, I only buy and sell the Souls of heretical and demonic cultivators, which can be considered acting on behalf of Heaven to guard the Dao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Even if you offer more money, I won't kill the innocent to claim credit and commit crimes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"This is the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the largest famous righteous sect in the Flying Cloud Kingdom!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Sun Lingtong waved his hand: "Alright, alright. I'll take back the deposit for now, but you must continue to monitor Qin De."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"I'll take all the other Souls you have on your stall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"I still want to do the business regarding Qin De."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The grey-robed cultivator nodded hurriedly: "Me too, me too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">In Sun Lingtong's two purchases, he had bought up all the Souls the man was peddling; this was obviously a major client.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The business regarding Qin De's Soul was worth a staggering five hundred thousand mid-grade Spirit Stones. Naturally, he didn't want to miss such a big deal either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sun Lingtong followed up: "I can forgo the compensation money."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"But we need to sign a Divine Contract to ensure basic trust."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The grey-robed cultivator immediately fell into hesitation: "This..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"I have never signed any Divine Contract with any buyer. Besides, the rules of the black market..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Before he could finish, Sun Lingtong interrupted him with a wave of his hand: "Don't give me that useless talk. Only by signing a Divine Contract can we continue to do business, otherwise, forget it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The grey-robed cultivator gritted his teeth, struggled internally for a few moments, and finally nodded: "Fine!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Not long after, Sun Lingtong quietly left the black market carrying a pile of Souls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Currently, within the main gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Ning Zhuo could not leave. The largest and most stable channel for purchasing Souls was this grey-robed cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Signing the Divine Contract this time was equivalent to securing this channel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"My matter with the Sage Great Thief Sutra can be put aside for now. Little Zhuo needs Souls, the more the better. The supply cannot be cut off."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"As for you... hehe, how long do you think you can hide after signing a Divine Contract?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Sooner or later, I will dig out your true identity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">In the courtyard, the fragrance of tea curled upwards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng were chatting happily with Nangong Zhi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Nangong Zhi appeared to be about thirty years old and was a female Confucian cultivator. Her black hair fell like a waterfall, and she wore a sky-blue traditional skirt. Her movements carried a scholarly air, yet also revealed a sense of capability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Song Taosheng gently waved his folding fan and narrated the preliminarily drafted trial plan: "...This Rising Cloud Minor Trial, I intend not to focus on arena fighting. We should set up several checkpoints, hosted by us Confucian cultivators, to run simultaneously. Each checkpoint will display a refining method for a unique type of paper and provide sufficient materials to assist the challenging Cultivators in attempting papermaking. In the end, the winner will be decided by a comprehensive evaluation of the variety, quantity, and quality of the paper produced within the stipulated time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Nangong Zhi nodded slightly and said, "This is exactly 'applying what one learns.' It not only displays our Confucian sect's skills but also shows the sincerity of our exchange. Very good, it suits my taste."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">She smiled beautifully: "Since Senior Duanmu has spoken and values Ning Zhuo, as a junior sister, I cannot be stingy. I am willing to take out my savings to sponsor this minor trial and personally step forward to host the refining checkpoint for [Heavenly Star Paper]."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Hearing this, Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng were overjoyed and bowed in thanks simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Nangong Zhi: "According to the plan of you two fellow Daoists, who will be invited to host the next checkpoint?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Chu Xuangui: "Situ Gu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Nangong Zhi raised her eyebrows slightly: "Fellow Daoist Situ... I'm afraid that won't be easy. He has always... hmm, disliked publicity. To ask him to host the [Haoran Xuan Paper] checkpoint this time, requiring him to contribute his exclusive refining tricks and treasured materials, I fear..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">No one could match Situ Gu's attainments in [Haoran Xuan Paper]. If he could not participate in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, the foundation of the event would inevitably be somewhat weaker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The Confucian cultivators within the Myriad Manifestations Sect all knew Situ Gu's temperament well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng had already prepared themselves for pestering and bargaining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">They bid farewell to Nangong Zhi and arrived at Situ Gu's simple courtyard located halfway up the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The gate of the courtyard was wide open, and Situ Gu came out to welcome them first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He was wearing a semi-worn dark brown Confucian robe. He was thin, with a rigid face, and three strands of long beard under his chin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Fellow Daoist Chu, Fellow Daoist Song! Enter, please come in!" Situ Gu's voice was an octave higher than usual, unexpectedly enthusiastic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He welcomed the two into the courtyard and treated them to spirit tea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Song Taosheng coughed lightly, considered his words, and stated their purpose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Situ Gu stroked his beard and said, "Since we have already received the approval of old Mister Duanmu Zhang, naturally, I must also contribute money and effort!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">His attitude was enthusiastic, and he agreed immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Things went so smoothly it was unbelievable. Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng exchanged a few more pleasantries, expressed their gratitude repeatedly, and then rose to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Walking on the way back, Song Taosheng finally couldn't hold it back and lowered his voice: "Brother Chu, don't you think... Fellow Daoist Situ was a bit too enthusiastic today?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">A sharp light flashed in Chu Xuangui's eyes as he said in a deep voice, "More than just enthusiastic. He agreed too readily, yet deep in his eyes, there was a trace of imperceptible flickering and urgency. It is absolutely not his usual calculating nature. There is something strange about this..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Song Taosheng sighed. The matter being too smooth made him alert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The two conferred and decided that after persuading the others, they would start investigating this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Meanwhile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Situ Gu returned to his study and met with two Confucian cultivators with unfamiliar faces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The one in the seat of honor was wearing deep black clothes, about forty or fifty years old, with a pure and distinct appearance. His eyes were as deep as ancient wells. He was the Great Confucian, Zhao Hansheng. His aura was condensed; sitting there, he was like a deep pool or a towering mountain, possessing a bearing that commanded respect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">In the lower seat was a young man, appearing no more than twenty, dressed in moon-white Confucian robes. His face was extraordinarily handsome, like a jade tree in the wind. However, the lingering arrogance between his brows gave him less warmth and more aloofness. He was Zhao Hansheng's disciple, known even in the Hua Zhang Country as a famous contemporary genius - Gu Qing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Both fellow Daoists heard it; I have already agreed to participate in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial." Situ Gu said with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">With a slightly hesitant tone, he added, "But I'm afraid Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng have already sensed something strange. It won't be hidden for long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Hearing this, the corners of Gu Qing's mouth hooked into a calm smile, a smile containing the confidence of controlling everything. He picked up the tea cup in front of him, took a light sip, his movements elegant and composed: "Mr. Situ need not worry. We didn't intend to hide it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Zhao Hansheng stroked his beard, his voice steady but carrying an unquestionable authority: "Correct. Next, we will actively visit. We will go directly to visit Duanmu Zhang! Fellow Daoist Situ, why not come along?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Situ Gu hesitated for a moment but ultimately shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Gu Qing, wearing a smile, stood up first: "In that case, we shall take our leave first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Situ Gu hurriedly saw them off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">On the way leaving on a cloud, Gu Qing transmitted his thoughts via divine sense, full of disdain: "Situ Gu is nothing special. He hesitates in his actions, wanting to get close to us but also wanting to save face. With such indecisiveness, trying to play both sides, how can he achieve anything?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Zhao Hansheng: "The Confucian cultivator group within the Myriad Manifestations Sect consists only of these people. However, for you, they still have value."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Gu Qing: "That is true. Leaving the clan to travel the world this time, I intend to accumulate merit so that when I return to Hua Zhang Country, I can strive for higher status and fame."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"From what we learned from Situ Gu about the Confucian cultivators' plans, since they want to prop up this outsider, Ning Zhuo, going so far as to set up several stages for the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, then don't blame me for borrowing their chicken to lay my egg. I will directly use such a good opportunity to formally take the stage and step on Ning Zhuo to make my name instantly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng found Li Guanyu under a weeping willow by a stream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Li Guanyu was unkempt, with wine stains on his green shirt. He was leaning against the tree trunk, holding a wine gourd and drinking alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Fellow Daoist Li, what elegant interests." Song Taosheng stepped forward with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Hearing the voice, Li Guanyu looked up. Seeing them with his blurry, drunken eyes, he grinned, revealing white teeth: "It's you guys. Come, come, come, drink a cup with me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Fellow Daoist Li, we'll drink later. We two came here to discuss important business." Chu Xuangui revealed the concept of the Rising Cloud Minor Trial in detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Li Guanyu was very straightforward: "Sounds interesting! Fine, I'll take the [Heart Fire Plain Paper] checkpoint!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">This was the most direct and convenient conversation yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Just as Chu Xuangui was about to speak his thanks, a flying letter shot over. It was sent by Duanmu Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Zhao Hansheng? Gu Qing? So that's it..." Chu Xuangui suddenly realized the truth and handed the flying letter to Song Taosheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">After reading it, Song Taosheng immediately frowned: "Things have become troublesome."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Li Guanyu also read the letter: "Zhao Hansheng, I've heard of him. He is a famous Great Confucian of the Hua Zhang Country, on par with our Mister Duanmu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Gu Qing has a noble status and intelligent natural talent. He became famous at a young age and is a true genius among us Confucian cultivators!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"With the current situation, they also want to participate in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Ning Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Is likely not Gu Qing's opponent."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
