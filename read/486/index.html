Within Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The battle to encircle and suppress the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit had reached its most critical moment.<br/>
<br/>
“Not good, it’s trying to escape! Quick, catch it!” Zhou Nongying cried out in alarm.<br/>
<br/>
The formation that had been trapping the Fire Spirit was riddled with cracks in all directions because it had borne too much of the residual shock from the fighting.<br/>
<br/>
After a bitter struggle, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit had fallen into a dreadful state. Its will to fight had dropped sharply, and it no longer wanted to continue. It chose to flee.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying pursued it from behind.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan and the second Golden Core ancestor of the Zhou family flanked it on the left and right.<br/>
<br/>
It looked like they would not make it in time and that the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit was about to escape when suddenly, a walnut shot down from high in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
The walnut radiated emerald light and struck the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit right on top of its head.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Ning Jiufan’s eyelids twitched, and he instinctively slowed down.<br/>
<br/>
The other Golden Core ancestor of the Zhou family was the first to reach the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit’s side.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit did not move at all; it toppled over into the lava and bobbed up and down.<br/>
<br/>
“Not good.” Ning Jiufan secretly cried out. He remembered Ning Zhuo’s request —Ning Zhuo very much needed this Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Now it seemed it would fall into the hands of the Zhou family’s Golden Core cultivator. If he had to ransom it, it would definitely cost much more.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Ning Jiufan was blaming himself, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit suddenly opened its eyes and erupted in a final, desperate strike.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
A terrifying explosion erupted. Magma surged like monstrous waves in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
In the blink of an eye, the Zhou family’s Golden Core ancestor was engulfed from head to toe in raging flames.<br/>
<br/>
He let out a shrill, miserable scream.<br/>
<br/>
All his defensive measures that he had hastily activated were instantly burned to nothing. His robes and armor turned to ash.<br/>
<br/>
His flesh was obliterated in the orange-red flames in the blink of an eye. His exposed skeleton was roasted to charcoal and disintegrated inch by inch.<br/>
<br/>
In just two breaths, a Golden Core cultivator had vanished into smoke.<br/>
<br/>
And after killing its foe, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit dimmed all over, its body shrinking to about the size of a fist.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan remained on guard. He arrived hot on its heels and used a talisman to seal it smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
“I got the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit!”<br/>
<br/>
“That was so close…”<br/>
<br/>
Even though the battle had lasted so long and they were in a volcano, Ning Jiufan felt chills run through his heart.<br/>
<br/>
If he had not hesitated just now, the one who would have fallen into disaster might have been him.<br/>
<br/>
From beginning to end, Meng Kui, who had been seated on the throne in the Lava Immortal Palace within the magma, slowly closed his eyes and no longer watched the volcano’s battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
His expression was displeased, and he felt regret.<br/>
<br/>
To avoid suspicion, he had never personally joined the fight. This was to prevent the Zhuo family from pursuing the matter afterward.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was his main target. Meng Kui had smashed a walnut down, then withdrawn his hand in secret, so the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit’s injuries were not that severe.<br/>
<br/>
In this battle, Ning Jiufan’s performance was quite eye-catching, even though there were also Nascent Soul-level cultivators like Lin Bufan taking part.<br/>
<br/>
“His demonic pet, the Fire-Melting Demon Ape, also seems to have begun cultivating…”<br/>
<br/>
“Sigh.”<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui sighed inwardly.<br/>
<br/>
At the crucial moment just now, Ning Jiufan hesitated by a step. That caused him to miss the Fire Spirit’s final counterattack and ruined Meng Kui’s plan.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Meng Kui still had a gain— the Zhou family had lost a Golden Core cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
“If earlier I could have successfully weakened Ning Jiufan’s fate, he surely would have met disaster.”<br/>
<br/>
“What exactly does he have on him that can conceal and protect his fate?”<br/>
<br/>
“Could it be that the Southern Bean royal family secretly gave him something?”<br/>
<br/>
It was no wonder Meng Kui suspected this.<br/>
<br/>
Because previously, he had used the Peach of Destiny Walnut to smash Ning Jiufan on the head, and the effect was very obvious.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, Ning Jiufan clearly had no protective treasure for his fate.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan took a deep breath and cast another spell.<br/>
<br/>
The turbulent magma quickly settled under his magic.<br/>
<br/>
The grand formation slowly opened.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying wore a face full of grief as he flew over to converge with Ning Jiufan and Lin Bufan.<br/>
<br/>
He had no time to mourn his clansman’s fall. His mind was already beginning to calculate the situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City going forward.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since the battle for the Lava Immortal Palace, the Zheng family had been forced out, and the Ning family had occupied the Zheng family’s territory. They rose quickly, becoming the foremost power beneath the City Lord’s estate.<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, the Zhou family, as an old family of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, would want to suppress a newcomer like the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
However, the situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City was unusual.<br/>
<br/>
The Meng family intended to seize this place and was a more pressing, powerful enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, because of Zhu Xuanji’s methods, the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families had formed an alliance with the royal family, so it was hard for the Zhou family to suddenly change course.<br/>
<br/>
Under these circumstances, the Ning family received great support from the Zhuo family, so it would be very difficult for the Zhou family to strike.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, within the Ning family, Ning Zhuo was a disciple who defied conventional standards, displaying Golden Core-level combat power during the Lava Immortal Palace struggle. Along with Ning Jiufan’s own formidable strength, it became even more impossible for the Zhou family to act.<br/>
<br/>
Hence, after Ning Zhuo’s branch family separated, Zhou Nongying personally visited him and made friendly overtures. He even had the Zhou family’s cultivators help Ning Zhuo arrange formations.<br/>
<br/>
All this was when the Zhou family still had both Golden Core cultivators alive.<br/>
<br/>
Now that there was only Zhou Nongying left at Golden Core level, the Zhou family’s situation had worsened. Their power was greatly reduced, and they would likely become the Ning family’s vassal.<br/>
<br/>
Outside Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu and Zhu Xuanji also learned the outcome of this battle.<br/>
<br/>
“In the end, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit still fell into Ning Jiufan’s hands. Ning Zhuo truly is a Child of Destiny. Such strong fate truly is astonishing,” Shen Lingshu sighed.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji murmured, “In the end, Meng Kui got what he wanted. The Zhou family lost a Golden Core cultivator, so our side’s strength in Fire Persimmon Immortal City has still weakened considerably.”<br/>
<br/>
“From now on, the Ning family is the main force standing in Meng Kui’s way.”<br/>
<br/>
“It appears we must increase our support for the Ning family.”<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu nodded in agreement, smiling. “I just boosted Ning Jiufan’s fate. Now he has our help, which makes perfect sense.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said, “Putting other things aside, if we only talk about the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect matter, the Ning family is a close ally of my Zhuo family. Sigh, if Ning Zhuo were not the Child of Destiny, it would be much easier for us to act.”<br/>
<br/>
After the two discussed for a while, they concealed themselves and quietly drew closer to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
In Two note Nation.<br/>
<br/>
In Green Forest Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Within the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
“Cough, cough!” The horse under Liu Er suddenly stumbled and stepped into a dirt pit.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was in the midst of intense drilling with his soldiers. Caught off guard, when the horse fell to the ground, he was thrown off as well.<br/>
<br/>
Although Liu Er quickly stood back up, the commotion was quite loud and drew the soldiers to gather around and check on him.<br/>
<br/>
“Big Brother, are you all right?” Zhang Hei ran over first, asking in concern.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m fine.” Liu Er shook his head and frowned at the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong also urged his horse forward to inspect the scene. After looking it over, he sighed in relief. “It was just an unseen hole in the ground. The horse’s hoof stepped right in.”<br/>
<br/>
Because Liu Er had been drilling his troops for a long time, coordinating with the soldiers and training battle formations, the horse had grown fatigued. When it stepped into the hole, it fell, bringing him down with it.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er fell because he had been concentrating almost all his energy on orchestrating the formations, so his reaction was a bit slow.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er patted his armor, pulled up his horse, and mounted it again. “Continue the training!”<br/>
<br/>
With that order, the Three Generals Camp resumed its drill.<br/>
<br/>
However, Liu Er kept his brows furrowed, feeling as if there was a big gap in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
“What is this terrible feeling, exactly?”<br/>
<br/>
“Could it be that Mu Lan is forcing Ning Zhuo into a dual-cultivation by coercion?”<br/>
<br/>
“And the strategist too! He leaves the camp every single day, nowhere to be found.”<br/>
<br/>
“Sigh, if I’d agreed to his request earlier and given him a quota, then he’d probably be here right now, putting his mechanical soldiers through their paces.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had already entered the Ten Thousand Li Wandering Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
He slowly raised his head and straightened up, no longer bent over his desk.<br/>
<br/>
A stack of blueprints covered the tabletop before him, all sorts of mechanical structures.<br/>
<br/>
In Green Forest Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
“Honored guest, please see yourself out.” The shop assistant in the Book Pavilion sent Ning Zhuo off respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo strolled out of the Book Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
He had just gone in to select a cultivation technique for Meng Yehu.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yehu was even more gifted than Yuan Dasheng and could cultivate a technique. Ning Zhuo had carefully picked and finally chosen one for him.<br/>
<br/>
This technique was closely tied to Meng Yehu’s natural gifts and was called the Night-Stalking Thornback Diagram.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the Ten Thousand Li Wandering Dragon, Ning Zhuo buried his head in designing a mechanical body for Meng Yehu.<br/>
<br/>
Among all the design drafts, Meng Yehu was drawn with a tiger’s head and a human body, as much as possible matching his spirit and restoring his original appearance.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo mainly focused on his innate ability, Night Shadow Yinsha, when designing his mechanical body.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of materials, Ghostshadow Bamboo was the most suitable. After all, it was originally an accompanying treasure of Night Shadow Yinsha.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo did not have much Ghostshadow Bamboo in his possession, and that sort of treasure was rather rare. He did not want to use it right away. He had already decided that he would use other precious materials first and wait for the right time to consider it again.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t know that much about Night Shadow Yinsha, plus Meng Yehu’s chosen technique is the Night-Stalking Thornback Diagram, which has nothing to do with the five elements.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered for a long time, thinking until his head hurt.<br/>
<br/>
One plan was to use Ghostshadow Talismans as the main focus. Whenever Meng Yehu unleashed his Night Shadow Yinsha, the Ghostshadow Talismans would trigger, creating countless pitch-black phantoms that would instantly form an army of dozens, an excellent method of carrying out… well, a righteous group beating.<br/>
<br/>
A second plan was to use mechanical components to alter the form of Night Shadow Yinsha, transforming it into a skyful of baleful energy to corrode enemies and create illusions for their vision and minds, confusing them with what was real or false.<br/>
<br/>
A third plan was to lay out a blade array on Meng Yehu’s body. Once activated, it would create thousands of Night Shadow blades, slicing and dicing an enemy until they died a gruesome death.<br/>
<br/>
A fourth plan made full use of the Night-Stalking Thornback Diagram, equipping Meng Yehu with mechanical parts to double his speed in dark environments, darting about like a ghost, impossible to pin down.<br/>
<br/>
A fifth plan was to arrange a Netherworld Soul-Binding Array as the core, combining it with Night Shadow Yinsha to entrap an enemy’s soul inside. The more souls were bound, the stronger Meng Yehu would become.<br/>
<br/>
A sixth plan…<br/>
<br/>
A seventh…<br/>
<br/>
An eighth…<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo conceived more than twenty smaller plans, which left him dizzy. He could not decide on one, nor choose what to drop.<br/>
<br/>
“Trying out every single one would be totally impractical.”<br/>
<br/>
“My current finances can’t handle such extravagant experiments either.”<br/>
<br/>
“I need to pick the one most suitable plan.”<br/>
<br/>
But that was exactly the dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo himself did not know which plan was the best.<br/>
<br/>
He could not simply declare it. He had to test it on a real battlefield to see the answer.<br/>
<br/>
“Sigh!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out a heavy sigh, stood up, and was about to go outside for some fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
That movement knocked into the desk, causing all the design sketches to scatter across the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo bent over, ready to pick them up, when he suddenly froze in place because the five or six sketches on the ground happened to overlap each other and form a complete shape of Meng Yehu.<br/>
<br/>
Even more importantly, from Ning Zhuo’s mental calculations, this combined plan was actually very good and had a high likelihood of success.<br/>
<br/>
“This is really my lucky day!”<br/>
<br/>
The more Ning Zhuo thought about it, the more he felt that this plan was excellent. He made up his mind at once: “I’ll use this plan!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo acted decisively. He immediately left the mechanical dragon and headed to all the major markets and shops in Green Forest Immortal City to make purchases. He spent large sums of spirit stones, exchanging them for the materials he needed.<br/>
<br/>
“I have to thank this war!”<br/>
<br/>
“Green Forest Immortal City has been turned into a major rear stronghold, so I can buy everything I want here.”<br/>
<br/>
“Under normal circumstances, Green Forest Immortal City would never have so many materials.”<br/>
<br/>
While Ning Zhuo was working hard for Meng Yehu, Sun Lingtong lay bored inside the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat.<br/>
<br/>
“This cultivation method might have a thousand benefits, but there’s one thing I really hate about it!”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s just way too boring!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was so bored he could hardly stand it. He began recklessly circulating his blood essence, trying to assist the Great art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.<br/>
<br/>
The result…<br/>
<br/>
His blood essence rampaged through his body and immediately caused internal injuries.<br/>
<br/>
His organs were harmed, and he began bleeding profusely inside.<br/>
<br/>
“Not good, not good at all.”<br/>
<br/>
“Where is Little Zhuo? Help me!”<br/>
<br/>
His blood rushed upward, blocking his mouth and nose.<br/>
<br/>
He gradually began to suffocate. At this moment, he was suddenly graced with insight and gained a deeper understanding of the Great art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.<br/>
<br/>
“So that’s how it is.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was overjoyed and felt a flash of realization, a wondrous delight filling his heart.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the verses of the Great art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing radiated even greater brilliance.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong not only escaped danger but also doubled his cultivation efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo finished selecting materials, he did not refine them himself. He sought out Jin Li once again.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted Jin Li’s help to handle these materials and forge some mechanical components.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Li laughed heartily. “Ning my young friend, you’ve come at just the right time. The royal capital sent a few artifact-crafting cultivators to assist me.”<br/>
<br/>
“They arrived just yesterday, and today they’re coming here to refine artifacts.”<br/>
<br/>
“Tell them what you need.”<br/>
<br/>
“With their skill, though not as good as mine, they’ll surely be able to help you accomplish this.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cupped his hands in thanks and offered a portion of materials to Jin Li as a token of gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Li burst out laughing, excitedly patting Ning Zhuo on the shoulder. “Ning Zhuo, my young friend, you’re too polite. You really went to great expense.”<br/>
<br/>
People willing to spend money were generally well-received.<br/>
<br/>
With help from Jin Li’s subordinates, Ning Zhuo obtained all the semi-finished parts that same night.<br/>
<br/>
“Many hands really do make light work. If I did this alone, it would take at least half a year to get this far.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt that the money and gifts were well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
He simply stayed up all night putting the mechanical parts together.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Yehu’s body took on a rough, blurry shape.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo removed Meng Yehu’s spirit core and placed it into the body, the mechanical Meng Yehu activated soon after.<br/>
<br/>
He did not look around, nor did he examine his new shell. Instead, he bowed deeply to Ning Zhuo, speaking in a low voice:<br/>
<br/>
“Father God!”<br/>
