<paragraph index="1">Within Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The battle to encircle and suppress the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit had reached its most critical moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Not good, it’s trying to escape! Quick, catch it!” Zhou Nongying cried out in alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The formation that had been trapping the Fire Spirit was riddled with cracks in all directions because it had borne too much of the residual shock from the fighting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">After a bitter struggle, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit had fallen into a dreadful state. Its will to fight had dropped sharply, and it no longer wanted to continue. It chose to flee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zhou Nongying pursued it from behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Jiufan and the second Golden Core ancestor of the Zhou family flanked it on the left and right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">It looked like they would not make it in time and that the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit was about to escape when suddenly, a walnut shot down from high in the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The walnut radiated emerald light and struck the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit right on top of its head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Seeing this, Ning Jiufan’s eyelids twitched, and he instinctively slowed down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The other Golden Core ancestor of the Zhou family was the first to reach the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit’s side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit did not move at all; it toppled over into the lava and bobbed up and down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Not good.” Ning Jiufan secretly cried out. He remembered Ning Zhuo’s request —Ning Zhuo very much needed this Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Now it seemed it would fall into the hands of the Zhou family’s Golden Core cultivator. If he had to ransom it, it would definitely cost much more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Just as Ning Jiufan was blaming himself, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit suddenly opened its eyes and erupted in a final, desperate strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">A terrifying explosion erupted. Magma surged like monstrous waves in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In the blink of an eye, the Zhou family’s Golden Core ancestor was engulfed from head to toe in raging flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He let out a shrill, miserable scream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">All his defensive measures that he had hastily activated were instantly burned to nothing. His robes and armor turned to ash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">His flesh was obliterated in the orange-red flames in the blink of an eye. His exposed skeleton was roasted to charcoal and disintegrated inch by inch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">In just two breaths, a Golden Core cultivator had vanished into smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">And after killing its foe, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit dimmed all over, its body shrinking to about the size of a fist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Jiufan remained on guard. He arrived hot on its heels and used a talisman to seal it smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“I got the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“That was so close…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Even though the battle had lasted so long and they were in a volcano, Ning Jiufan felt chills run through his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">If he had not hesitated just now, the one who would have fallen into disaster might have been him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">From beginning to end, Meng Kui, who had been seated on the throne in the Lava Immortal Palace within the magma, slowly closed his eyes and no longer watched the volcano’s battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">His expression was displeased, and he felt regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">To avoid suspicion, he had never personally joined the fight. This was to prevent the Zhuo family from pursuing the matter afterward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Jiufan was his main target. Meng Kui had smashed a walnut down, then withdrawn his hand in secret, so the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit’s injuries were not that severe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In this battle, Ning Jiufan’s performance was quite eye-catching, even though there were also Nascent Soul-level cultivators like Lin Bufan taking part.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“His demonic pet, the Fire-Melting Demon Ape, also seems to have begun cultivating…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Sigh.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Meng Kui sighed inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">At the crucial moment just now, Ning Jiufan hesitated by a step. That caused him to miss the Fire Spirit’s final counterattack and ruined Meng Kui’s plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Of course, Meng Kui still had a gain— the Zhou family had lost a Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“If earlier I could have successfully weakened Ning Jiufan’s fate, he surely would have met disaster.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“What exactly does he have on him that can conceal and protect his fate?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Could it be that the Southern Bean royal family secretly gave him something?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">It was no wonder Meng Kui suspected this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Because previously, he had used the Peach of Destiny Walnut to smash Ning Jiufan on the head, and the effect was very obvious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">At that time, Ning Jiufan clearly had no protective treasure for his fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Lin Bufan took a deep breath and cast another spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The turbulent magma quickly settled under his magic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The grand formation slowly opened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Zhou Nongying wore a face full of grief as he flew over to converge with Ning Jiufan and Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He had no time to mourn his clansman’s fall. His mind was already beginning to calculate the situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City going forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ever since the battle for the Lava Immortal Palace, the Zheng family had been forced out, and the Ning family had occupied the Zheng family’s territory. They rose quickly, becoming the foremost power beneath the City Lord’s estate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Generally speaking, the Zhou family, as an old family of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, would want to suppress a newcomer like the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">However, the situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City was unusual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Meng family intended to seize this place and was a more pressing, powerful enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Previously, because of Zhu Xuanji’s methods, the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families had formed an alliance with the royal family, so it was hard for the Zhou family to suddenly change course.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Under these circumstances, the Ning family received great support from the Zhuo family, so it would be very difficult for the Zhou family to strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Additionally, within the Ning family, Ning Zhuo was a disciple who defied conventional standards, displaying Golden Core-level combat power during the Lava Immortal Palace struggle. Along with Ning Jiufan’s own formidable strength, it became even more impossible for the Zhou family to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Hence, after Ning Zhuo’s branch family separated, Zhou Nongying personally visited him and made friendly overtures. He even had the Zhou family’s cultivators help Ning Zhuo arrange formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">All this was when the Zhou family still had both Golden Core cultivators alive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Now that there was only Zhou Nongying left at Golden Core level, the Zhou family’s situation had worsened. Their power was greatly reduced, and they would likely become the Ning family’s vassal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Outside Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Shen Lingshu and Zhu Xuanji also learned the outcome of this battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“In the end, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Spirit still fell into Ning Jiufan’s hands. Ning Zhuo truly is a Child of Destiny. Such strong fate truly is astonishing,” Shen Lingshu sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zhu Xuanji murmured, “In the end, Meng Kui got what he wanted. The Zhou family lost a Golden Core cultivator, so our side’s strength in Fire Persimmon Immortal City has still weakened considerably.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“From now on, the Ning family is the main force standing in Meng Kui’s way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“It appears we must increase our support for the Ning family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Shen Lingshu nodded in agreement, smiling. “I just boosted Ning Jiufan’s fate. Now he has our help, which makes perfect sense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhu Xuanji said, “Putting other things aside, if we only talk about the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect matter, the Ning family is a close ally of my Zhuo family. Sigh, if Ning Zhuo were not the Child of Destiny, it would be much easier for us to act.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After the two discussed for a while, they concealed themselves and quietly drew closer to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In Two note Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In Green Forest Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Within the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Cough, cough!” The horse under Liu Er suddenly stumbled and stepped into a dirt pit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Liu Er was in the midst of intense drilling with his soldiers. Caught off guard, when the horse fell to the ground, he was thrown off as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Although Liu Er quickly stood back up, the commotion was quite loud and drew the soldiers to gather around and check on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Big Brother, are you all right?” Zhang Hei ran over first, asking in concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“I’m fine.” Liu Er shook his head and frowned at the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Guan Hong also urged his horse forward to inspect the scene. After looking it over, he sighed in relief. “It was just an unseen hole in the ground. The horse’s hoof stepped right in.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Because Liu Er had been drilling his troops for a long time, coordinating with the soldiers and training battle formations, the horse had grown fatigued. When it stepped into the hole, it fell, bringing him down with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Liu Er fell because he had been concentrating almost all his energy on orchestrating the formations, so his reaction was a bit slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Liu Er patted his armor, pulled up his horse, and mounted it again. “Continue the training!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">With that order, the Three Generals Camp resumed its drill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">However, Liu Er kept his brows furrowed, feeling as if there was a big gap in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“What is this terrible feeling, exactly?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Could it be that Mu Lan is forcing Ning Zhuo into a dual-cultivation by coercion?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“And the strategist too! He leaves the camp every single day, nowhere to be found.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“Sigh, if I’d agreed to his request earlier and given him a quota, then he’d probably be here right now, putting his mechanical soldiers through their paces.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo had already entered the Ten Thousand Li Wandering Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He slowly raised his head and straightened up, no longer bent over his desk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">A stack of blueprints covered the tabletop before him, all sorts of mechanical structures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">In Green Forest Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Honored guest, please see yourself out.” The shop assistant in the Book Pavilion sent Ning Zhuo off respectfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo strolled out of the Book Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He had just gone in to select a cultivation technique for Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Meng Yehu was even more gifted than Yuan Dasheng and could cultivate a technique. Ning Zhuo had carefully picked and finally chosen one for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">This technique was closely tied to Meng Yehu’s natural gifts and was called the Night-Stalking Thornback Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Returning to the Ten Thousand Li Wandering Dragon, Ning Zhuo buried his head in designing a mechanical body for Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Among all the design drafts, Meng Yehu was drawn with a tiger’s head and a human body, as much as possible matching his spirit and restoring his original appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo mainly focused on his innate ability, Night Shadow Yinsha, when designing his mechanical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In terms of materials, Ghostshadow Bamboo was the most suitable. After all, it was originally an accompanying treasure of Night Shadow Yinsha.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">But Ning Zhuo did not have much Ghostshadow Bamboo in his possession, and that sort of treasure was rather rare. He did not want to use it right away. He had already decided that he would use other precious materials first and wait for the right time to consider it again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“I don’t know that much about Night Shadow Yinsha, plus Meng Yehu’s chosen technique is the Night-Stalking Thornback Diagram, which has nothing to do with the five elements.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo pondered for a long time, thinking until his head hurt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">One plan was to use Ghostshadow Talismans as the main focus. Whenever Meng Yehu unleashed his Night Shadow Yinsha, the Ghostshadow Talismans would trigger, creating countless pitch-black phantoms that would instantly form an army of dozens, an excellent method of carrying out… well, a righteous group beating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">A second plan was to use mechanical components to alter the form of Night Shadow Yinsha, transforming it into a skyful of baleful energy to corrode enemies and create illusions for their vision and minds, confusing them with what was real or false.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">A third plan was to lay out a blade array on Meng Yehu’s body. Once activated, it would create thousands of Night Shadow blades, slicing and dicing an enemy until they died a gruesome death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">A fourth plan made full use of the Night-Stalking Thornback Diagram, equipping Meng Yehu with mechanical parts to double his speed in dark environments, darting about like a ghost, impossible to pin down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">A fifth plan was to arrange a Netherworld Soul-Binding Array as the core, combining it with Night Shadow Yinsha to entrap an enemy’s soul inside. The more souls were bound, the stronger Meng Yehu would become.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">A sixth plan…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">A seventh…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">An eighth…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo conceived more than twenty smaller plans, which left him dizzy. He could not decide on one, nor choose what to drop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“Trying out every single one would be totally impractical.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“My current finances can’t handle such extravagant experiments either.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“I need to pick the one most suitable plan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">But that was exactly the dilemma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo himself did not know which plan was the best.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">He could not simply declare it. He had to test it on a real battlefield to see the answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“Sigh!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo let out a heavy sigh, stood up, and was about to go outside for some fresh air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">That movement knocked into the desk, causing all the design sketches to scatter across the floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo bent over, ready to pick them up, when he suddenly froze in place because the five or six sketches on the ground happened to overlap each other and form a complete shape of Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Even more importantly, from Ning Zhuo’s mental calculations, this combined plan was actually very good and had a high likelihood of success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“This is really my lucky day!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The more Ning Zhuo thought about it, the more he felt that this plan was excellent. He made up his mind at once: “I’ll use this plan!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo acted decisively. He immediately left the mechanical dragon and headed to all the major markets and shops in Green Forest Immortal City to make purchases. He spent large sums of spirit stones, exchanging them for the materials he needed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">“I have to thank this war!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">“Green Forest Immortal City has been turned into a major rear stronghold, so I can buy everything I want here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">“Under normal circumstances, Green Forest Immortal City would never have so many materials.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">While Ning Zhuo was working hard for Meng Yehu, Sun Lingtong lay bored inside the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">“This cultivation method might have a thousand benefits, but there’s one thing I really hate about it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">“It’s just way too boring!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Sun Lingtong was so bored he could hardly stand it. He began recklessly circulating his blood essence, trying to assist the Great art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The result…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">His blood essence rampaged through his body and immediately caused internal injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">His organs were harmed, and he began bleeding profusely inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">“Not good, not good at all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">“Where is Little Zhuo? Help me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">His blood rushed upward, blocking his mouth and nose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">He gradually began to suffocate. At this moment, he was suddenly graced with insight and gained a deeper understanding of the Great art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">“So that’s how it is.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Sun Lingtong was overjoyed and felt a flash of realization, a wondrous delight filling his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">In the next moment, the verses of the Great art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing radiated even greater brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Sun Lingtong not only escaped danger but also doubled his cultivation efficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">After Ning Zhuo finished selecting materials, he did not refine them himself. He sought out Jin Li once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">He wanted Jin Li’s help to handle these materials and forge some mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Jin Li laughed heartily. “Ning my young friend, you’ve come at just the right time. The royal capital sent a few artifact-crafting cultivators to assist me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">“They arrived just yesterday, and today they’re coming here to refine artifacts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">“Tell them what you need.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">“With their skill, though not as good as mine, they’ll surely be able to help you accomplish this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands in thanks and offered a portion of materials to Jin Li as a token of gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Jin Li burst out laughing, excitedly patting Ning Zhuo on the shoulder. “Ning Zhuo, my young friend, you’re too polite. You really went to great expense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">People willing to spend money were generally well-received.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">With help from Jin Li’s subordinates, Ning Zhuo obtained all the semi-finished parts that same night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">“Many hands really do make light work. If I did this alone, it would take at least half a year to get this far.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Ning Zhuo felt that the money and gifts were well worth it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">He simply stayed up all night putting the mechanical parts together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Meng Yehu’s body took on a rough, blurry shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">When Ning Zhuo removed Meng Yehu’s spirit core and placed it into the body, the mechanical Meng Yehu activated soon after.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">He did not look around, nor did he examine his new shell. Instead, he bowed deeply to Ning Zhuo, speaking in a low voice:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">“Father God!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">***************</paragraph><br/><br/>
