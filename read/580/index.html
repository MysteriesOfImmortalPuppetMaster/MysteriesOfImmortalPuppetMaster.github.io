<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“A divine aphrodisiac?” Ning Zhuo was momentarily stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He glanced at the burly, thick-bearded Yang Weida standing before him and recalled two significant facts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Firstly, Yang Weida was a merchant hailing from the Flying Cloud Kingdom. It wasn’t unusual for him to deal in aphrodisiacs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Secondly, Qing Yan, the Golden Core cultivator of the ghostman clan, had previously mentioned that Jiao Ma cultivated the Jiao family’s signature technique, the Three Furnace True Yang Scripture. It was precisely this scripture that made Jiao Ma abundantly vigorous, prompting Qing Yan to confidently predict that Jiao Ma would surely stand out among the male consorts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Considering these two points, Ning Zhuo nodded slightly and conveyed through spiritual sense to Yang Weida, “Then I’ll buy a little, just to test the effects.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Yang Weida’s expression brightened immediately but quickly froze in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Because when Ning Zhuo said “a little,” he literally meant only a tiny amount!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Jiao Ma, how am I supposed to sell such a tiny amount?” Yang Weida complained. “You’re not exactly short on cash.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo shook his head firmly. “You call it a divine medicine. Naturally, I must personally test its efficacy first. What if I buy too much and it turns out ineffective?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Although you’re from the outside, here, others see us as being from the same village.” Ning Zhuo patted Yang Weida’s shoulder, saying warmly, “So give me a good deal, will you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Yang Weida gritted his teeth. “Since we’re village mates, I suppose I have no choice!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Glancing around cautiously, he pulled out a medicine box, revealing the ointment inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Yang Weida used his spiritual sense to retrieve a fingertip-sized portion of the ointment, placed it carefully into a small vial, and handed it to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo exchanged it for a dozen spirit stones, completing the transaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Before leaving, Yang Weida advised, “If it works well, contact me again. We’re fellow villagers - I’ll give you the best discount!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo nodded and left without further comment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yang Weida quickly moved onto other male consorts, loudly proclaiming, “You’ve seen it yourselves - someone just bought my divine aphrodisiac. If you don’t follow suit, you’re missing out! Remember, slots in the Aphrodisiac Hall are limited…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong observed the whole scene silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Upon returning to Grade-A Room One, Sun Lingtong recounted the incident to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo, however, had already anticipated this and smiled, “Good. He’s advertising exactly as intended.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Taking out the vial, Ning Zhuo carefully extracted a tiny amount of the ointment, mixing it with other medicinal herbs to test its properties. After a brief examination, he confirmed its potency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Yang Weida hadn’t exaggerated; it genuinely worked well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Yet, as Ning Zhuo attempted to apply it to himself, the mechanism ring around his finger suddenly tightened slightly, a clear warning sign.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo’s eyes glinted coldly. After informing Sun Lingtong, he safely stored away the ointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong sighed. “I didn’t expect Yang Weida, with his honest appearance, to plot against others this way. He must be confident in his medicine, or perhaps he has powerful backing that gives him such boldness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“We’ll ignore it and pretend we know nothing,” Ning Zhuo responded calmly. “In fact, we’ll buy more from him when we encounter him again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Sun Lingtong nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">They weren’t short on money anyway!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">If Yang Weida wanted to scheme, Ning Zhuo was willing to play along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Let’s find a way to meet the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer and get the results of the divination. After that, we leave this place,” Ning Zhuo instructed Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Sun Lingtong agreed wholeheartedly. If not for Meng Yaoyin’s matter, he would have preferred staying longer for more excitement and adventure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“You keep playing the role of Jiao Ma, and I’ll scout around outside to find an opening,” Sun Lingtong volunteered proactively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Boss, I trust your methods completely. But wait half a day,” Ning Zhuo interjected suddenly. “I want to test out a new ability first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">This new ability Ning Zhuo intended to try was none other than the Spirit Mirror, his newly acquired life-bound technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He had already advanced to the Wondrous Visions Sowing Talismans stage, and unexpectedly, he had fully mastered the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, forming a complete talismanic technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique allowed Ning Zhuo to communicate with objects possessing spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">However, the Spirit Mirror life-bound spell went a step further, enabling him to draw spiritual beings from within mirrors, essentially granting him summoning capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“According to the Foundation Establishment section of the Mirror Stage Scripture, to maximize the power of this life-bound spell, I first need to forge my life-bound artifact. Boss, please help me with this task!” Ning Zhuo requested earnestly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong agreed without hesitation. Normally, cultivators should strictly keep their primary cultivation methods secret, but there was deep trust between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Given the close and intimate relationship between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, such taboos simply did not exist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo immediately handed over the contents for Sun Lingtong to read. After thoroughly absorbing the details, Sun Lingtong was fully prepared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Together, they entered the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, arriving before the mechanism platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo took out the Woodfire and infused it with spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The flames of the Woodfire were gentle, yet within mere breaths, it melted various precious materials into liquid form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Cold Iron, Flowing Cloud Sand, Great White Gold Essence, Heavenly Crystal, and Thick Earth merged into a silvery-white fluid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sun Lingtong controlled the mechanism platform, pulling the silver liquid into a perfectly round embryonic mirror shape within its groove.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He continued to manipulate the device, swiftly engraving formations within the embryonic mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Finally, a three-hundred-pound Tempering Copper Hammer rose from the platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The hammer descended forcefully, solidifying the formations and mirror embryo instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo bit open his right index finger, drawing out a drop of blood. Using his own vital essence, he etched intricate runes onto the mirror embryo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Woodfire was handed over to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Sun Lingtong gently blew onto the flame in his palm, sending sparks onto the mirror embryo, enveloping it in a sphere of fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">As the flames dispersed, Ning Zhuo quickly cooled the mirror using Cold Moon Essence Dew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">With a sizzling sound, steam rose amid swirling seven-colored smoke and haze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The haze cleared, revealing the mirror embryo floating gently in midair, trembling slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Taking a deep breath, Ning Zhuo decisively executed the final step - extracting the Spiritual Mirror’s technique rune from his own spirit sea, directly imprinting it onto the core of the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">With a soft resonance, the Spiritual Mirror artifact was complete!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo tested its capability immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Meng Yehu,” he called, drawing out the Nightblade Shadow Tiger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Holding the Spiritual Mirror up, Ning Zhuo aimed at Meng Yehu. A ray of light shot forth from the mirror, enveloping Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Connected deeply with Ning Zhuo, Meng Yehu offered no resistance and quickly vanished, absorbed into the mirror’s internal space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">With another flick, Ning Zhuo projected a beam of mirror light, instantly relocating Meng Yehu to a distant spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Excellent.” Ning Zhuo nodded, rapidly devising various combat strategies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He stored Meng Yehu within his storage belt, then summoned the mirror’s power once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This attempt was ten times harder, yet Ning Zhuo still managed to effortlessly summon Meng Yehu directly from the storage belt’s separate dimension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Marvelous!” Ning Zhuo visibly rejoiced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Though seemingly just a convenient trick, bypassing the spatial barrier of the storage belt represented a profound qualitative leap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">But Ning Zhuo quickly noticed cracks forming on the Shadowblade Night Tiger. The cross-dimensional summoning had severely strained the artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“This means Meng Yehu needs an upgrade. Once it reaches Artifact Level, it can withstand greater damage from cross-dimensional summoning.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“But at that point, my Spiritual Mirror would also have to reach Artifact Level, or else it would be like a pony pulling a cart.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Interesting, there’s actually much more I can do.” Ning Zhuo’s eyes gleamed with excitement, his gaze settling on Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun Lingtong shivered slightly, sensing Ning Zhuo’s intense stare, and turned cautiously, asking, “Little Zhuo, why are you looking at me like that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Shortly afterward, Sun Lingtong, feeling slightly dizzy, left Grade-A Room One.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Although Hidden Yang Mansion had strict management rules requiring male consorts to report their movements, servants like the ghostly Iron Weights needed only notify the gatekeepers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Passing through the middle courtyard, Sun Lingtong spotted a gathering of cultivators discussing something heatedly around a posted notice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Curious, Sun Lingtong approached but was immediately rebuked by a human male cultivator, “Ghostman clan servant? Whose slave are you? Get lost, don’t come near us!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">A sharp glint briefly flashed in Sun Lingtong’s eyes, but outwardly he bowed submissively and retreated, observing from afar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He vaguely saw it was a ranked list, a magical artifact whose rankings shifted periodically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">As he prepared to examine closely using a technique, a robust man strode boldly into the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Tall and muscular, with a sharply defined, inverted triangle torso, golden-red pupils, and dark golden hair, the man wore luxurious clothing: fiery red Firewash Cloth, a Golden Sunlight Soft Armor overlay, a Millennium Li-Fire Jade Pendant on his waist, and Thundercloud Flame-step Boots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He arrogantly unleashed a surge of power with a wave of his sleeve, scattering the gathered male consorts who nearly stumbled or fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Initially enraged, the consorts recognized him instantly, choking back their curses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">This proud man approached the notice, seeing his name - Golden Sun - at the very top, and sneered disdainfully, “Bunch of worthless trash.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Though humiliated, the surrounding consorts swallowed their indignation silently, seething internally but not daring to retaliate.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
