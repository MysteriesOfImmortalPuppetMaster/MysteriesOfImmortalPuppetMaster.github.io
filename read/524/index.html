Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The residence of Military Strategist Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the modest reception room, there were only Liu Er, Ning Zhuo, and Zhao Xi.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi took the seat of honor, with Ning Zhuo sitting beside him.<br/>
<br/>
“I pay my respects to you, Master Zhao!” Liu Er stood before Zhao Xi, clasped his hands in salute.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at Zhao Xi with sincerity and earnestly thanked him for his assistance.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi looked at Liu Er, and his gaze paused on the dried bloodstains at the corner of Liu Er’s mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Just then, when Shuangjing led the quartermaster to attack, Liu Er blocked their way with his body, was injured, and even coughed up blood, yet he had endured it all without seeking treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi nodded slightly, extended his finger, tapped Liu Er, and said, “You are sensible, very good.”<br/>
<br/>
Then, he casually waved his hand and said, “Sit down.”<br/>
<br/>
In Zhao Xi’s mind, he did not care at all about Liu Er’s mixed-blood Golden Core; his attention was fully focused on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the Green Forest Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had dealt with Zhao Xi.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, Ning Zhuo used Nascent Soul–level treasure material from the corpse of the old stone monster to lavishly bribe Zhao Xi, and also helped the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Zhao Xi, smiling, exchanged greetings with Ning Zhuo as an old friend.<br/>
<br/>
After a few idle words, Zhao Xi, as if joking, said, “To be honest, when I first met you, Young Master Ning, I never would have imagined that you would become the son-in-law of Grand Marshal Mu’s household, and the husband of Mu Lan!”<br/>
<br/>
He rubbed the handle of the wooden chair with his palm and exclaimed, “The ways of this world are truly beyond expectation, so mysterious!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo maintained a smile, yet his heart tensed slightly, as he knew that the discussion had reached an important juncture.<br/>
<br/>
He did not hesitate in the slightest, and immediately stated, “Regarding this matter, I also, by sheer chance, mustered my courage and stepped forward.<br/>
<br/>
I believe you, Master Zhao, already have a clear understanding of the situation at that time.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi immediately laughed out loud, pointed his finger at Ning Zhuo’s nose, and in a warm tone chided, “When I heard it then, I was dumbfounded!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else’s goal was not achieved, yet you, kid, ended up gaining the biggest benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Your luck is truly enviable, tsk tsk...”<br/>
<br/>
The smile on Ning Zhuo’s face immediately vanished, and he shook his head bitterly and said, “Sir, after this incident occurred, I received a letter from my family, in which I was severely held accountable and reprimanded.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I was one of the most valued heirs in my clan, bearing the responsibility of marrying into the South Bean Kingdom’s royal family.<br/>
<br/>
Once this matter came out, it indeed put my family in a very awkward position, and our relationship with the South Bean Kingdom suffered significant setbacks.<br/>
<br/>
Because I acted on a whim, the losses to my clan were far greater than outsiders could have imagined!”<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Ning Zhuo spoke with a heavy expression.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi slightly tilted his head back and said in an inexplicable tone, “In that case, if you ask me, why don’t you and your family simply relocate from the South Bean Kingdom to the Twin Rivers Kingdom?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head and said, “Sir, since you are in authority, I shall speak frankly.<br/>
<br/>
That is nearly impossible!<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, my clan, after enduring great hardship and paying a heavy price, finally established a foothold in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City of the South Bean Kingdom and developed rapidly. If we were to move to the Twin Rivers Kingdom, it would be like starting over from scratch —the cost would be too great.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the Twin Rivers Kingdom borders the Northern Wind Kingdom. My clan was forced to flee from the Northern Wind Kingdom back in the day, and if we get too close to the forces we once opposed, it would benefit neither my clan nor the Twin Rivers Kingdom.”<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Ning Zhuo stood up and clasped his fists toward Zhao Xi.<br/>
<br/>
With a solemn expression, he said, “Therefore, my marriage pact with Mu Lan must be annulled!<br/>
<br/>
The reason it is still maintained now is due to two main reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, since the fact has already been set in stone, and my clan has paid the price, I am thinking whether I can leverage this identity to work something out to recoup some of the clan’s losses.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, given the current military situation, the Red Flower Camp is the best ally of our Three Generals Camp, so I definitely will not annul the marriage pact with Mu Lan during this period. It would be bad for all parties!<br/>
<br/>
When the time is right, I will divorce Mu Lan as agreed.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi appeared relaxed, but in truth his eyes were focused intently, carefully observing every nuance of expression on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi saw nothing but frankness and sincerity.<br/>
<br/>
Both he and Liu Er secretly breathed a sigh of relief.<br/>
<br/>
Grand Marshal Mu Shang’s mansion was among the few top general households in the Twin Rivers Kingdom, holding an exalted status. With his status as a son-in-law, if Ning Zhuo were to immediately ascend into the Twin Rivers Kingdom’s court— and at the highest levels!<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the Twin Rivers Kingdom’s court, naturally no one would be willing to see such a foreigner occupying such a position.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had long been well aware of this.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, from the very beginning, he had made his stance and decision clear to all parties.<br/>
<br/>
On this occasion, Zhao Xi had come to the frontline camp, bearing many covert missions. Among them was to assess Ning Zhuo —to ascertain his views on Grand Marshal Mu Shang’s mansion, as well as his own intentions.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s response brought joy to Liu Er’s heart, and further made Zhao Xi feel secretly satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
In this way, Zhao Xi finally had the motivation to continue the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi squinted his eyes in a smile and said, “Young Master Ning Zhuo, sit down, have a seat and talk! You have voluntarily presented your ingenious contraptions to me this time, showing remarkable insight, and this act benefits the entire army. Whatever you desire, if it is within my power to decide, I will arrange it for you immediately.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also smiled and, as requested, sat down again, saying, “I have two main requests.<br/>
<br/>
“Firstly, it is the National Power Brick. After having used such a treasure, the impression was so profound that I became utterly addicted —unable to stop savoring it.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi laughed and said, “Granted!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued, “Secondly, let’s see if there are any items that can accelerate cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to explain in detail: I am currently in the second stage of the Foundation Establishment period, that is, the stage of treasure medicine proliferation.<br/>
<br/>
What was rather awkward was that, even if I obtained a new National Power Brick, it would be difficult to raise my cultivation level.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, I wanted to see if there were any auxiliary items specifically corresponding to that.”<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing this, Zhao Xi, after a few moments of contemplation, said knowingly, “The exchange list provided by the Quartermaster’s Office includes a vast array of items for assisting in cultivation, and among them there must surely be treasures suitable for the treasure medicine proliferation stage.<br/>
<br/>
However, for Young Master Ning Zhuo, exchanging battle merits for the National Power Brick is the primary concern.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, what you truly desire is a treasure of exceptional efficacy. I believe you have already perused the exchange list provided by the Quartermaster’s Office, and the effects of the treasures listed do not satisfy you.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately clasped his hands and said, “Master Zhao, you are so wise; you saw right through my thoughts at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
Battle merits are limited.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly would prefer to exchange for the National Power Brick. After all, such fine treasures are truly rare. Although there are many cultivation realms, the occurrence of awarding National Power Bricks is extremely scarce.<br/>
<br/>
It can be said that once you pass this village, there won’t be another store like it.<br/>
<br/>
Unless there is a treasure whose efficacy is so excellent that I would rather expend some battle merits to exchange for it, willingly sacrificing some National Power Bricks.<br/>
<br/>
But at present, I have not seen such a treasure on the list.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi nodded and sighed, “Young Master Ning Zhuo, you truly are born of a great clan; such a demand is a bit extravagant.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, who had been listening on the side, heard Zhao Xi’s evaluation and nodded in strong agreement.<br/>
<br/>
For the vast majority of cultivators, during the Foundation Establishment period, it was simply unnecessary to invest too many resources in cultivation. It was too wasteful!<br/>
<br/>
Because in the early stages, cultivation for a cultivator was relatively easy, and their cultivation level could be improved easily.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo, in the first stage of the Foundation Establishment period, had already used such a rare treasure as the National Power Brick. And in the second stage, he still intended to use treasures that were no less impressive than the National Power Brick to accelerate his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Was this necessary?<br/>
<br/>
Under normal circumstances, for the vast majority of cultivators, it was simply unnecessary!<br/>
<br/>
Saving resources for use in later stages of cultivation would be far more cost-effective.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was very young, only sixteen years old. For most young cultivators, they were still in the Qi Refinement stage. Even if there were geniuses who advanced to the Foundation Establishment period, they would not deliberately seek such heavy treasures solely to increase their cultivation level. They were more often used for other purposes, such as comprehending cultivation techniques or sparring in martial skills.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi’s evaluation that Ning Zhuo’s actions were extravagant resonated deeply with Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er recalled carefully that during his own Foundation Establishment period, he had worked hard on his own, spending almost half a day practicing cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
The resources that Ning Zhuo was consuming at this time, even if he were to advance to the Golden Core period, some of them would not even be utilized!<br/>
<br/>
Especially the National Power Brick.<br/>
<br/>
Such a fine treasure, Liu Er had never used one even to this day.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, he had indeed received such rewards for his battle merits, but he had all handed them over to Guan Hong to help the latter heal quickly.<br/>
<br/>
While Liu Er felt envious, he could only sigh that Ning Zhuo truly was the son of a great clan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo explained to the two that this was his first time participating in such a major battle, and his desire for cultivation had reached its peak in life; he earnestly hoped that he could become as strong as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, he was extremely eager to have such auxiliary treasures to help his cultivation break through to another level more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
This explanation further increased Liu Er and Zhao Xi’s understanding of Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi, recalling the intelligence, felt that Ning Zhuo’s move was quite reasonable. After all, his battle strength had reached the Golden Core level, and at present, his biggest shortcoming lay in himself. Strengthening one’s weaknesses was indeed the correct choice.<br/>
<br/>
It was just that Ning Zhuo’s willingness to expend such heavy funds was contrary to normal practice; it was surprising, yet deep down, it was also enviable.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi murmured, “After giving it careful thought, there indeed is such a treasure in our royal treasury.<br/>
<br/>
It was back then when an envoy from the Three Suns Kingdom visited, and as a diplomatic gift, a set of treasure talismans was presented to the royal family.<br/>
<br/>
The talisman was called the Three Yuan Interlocking Treasure Talisman. The royal family of the Three Suns Kingdom practiced the ‘Three Yang Kai Tai Jing’, and based on its content, they used Xuanmag jade sand refined by the light of the sun, moon, and stars as ink, inscribed the talisman symbols on thousand‐year‐old yin-yang phoenix tree leaves, and finally incorporated powder ground from the jiao dragon tendon, thus completing the masterpiece.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of treasure talisman was of such a high quality that it was at the level of a magical treasure, and it could be reused. Even after being expended to a certain extent, it could have additional materials added on its basis, be made anew, and thereby gain many more uses.<br/>
<br/>
As is well known, the ‘Three Yang Tai Yuan Gong’ embodies the concept of the genesis of all things, and is one of the top treasure techniques in the world. At the early stage of the Soul Formation level, one could even separate the Three Yang deities, which was extremely formidable. In the treasure medicine proliferation stage, it was merely child’s play compared to the ‘Three Yang Tai Yuan Gong’.<br/>
<br/>
If Young Master Ning Zhuo could exchange for this treasure, it would be tantamount to having certain cultivation advantages of the ‘Three Yang Tai Yuan Gong’ during the Foundation Establishment period!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was immediately intrigued and said, “As you say, can such a national treasure be exchanged for battle merits?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi laughed and said, “Naturally it wouldn’t work through normal channels, but isn’t there me?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately understood, and handed over a storage pouch, and told Zhao Xi that once the matter was accomplished, there would be double gifts offered.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi’s spiritual sense scanned it, and the corners of his mouth involuntarily curled up as he openly accepted the storage pouch.<br/>
<br/>
The atmosphere in the room naturally became even more congenial.<br/>
<br/>
The three of them then engaged in some idle chatter.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly Zhao Xi and Ning Zhuo conversed, with Liu Er occasionally interjecting.<br/>
<br/>
“It is getting late; I have matters to attend to.”<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving, Zhao Xi looked at Ning Zhuo, then at Liu Er, and said, “You are all my people now. In the coming period, you must earn as many battle merits as possible; the more merits you earn, the more face I will have!<br/>
<br/>
Since you have all presented your ingenious contraptions, it shows that you are enlightened.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t just fixate on those things on the battlefield; although they may be fine treasures, can they compare to battle merits?<br/>
<br/>
Especially the hilltops near our campm —the strongholds of those forces —their yield is extremely bountiful!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and Ning Zhuo immediately understood the implication.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then asked, “After cleaning up the battlefield, shouldn’t we launch a full -scale attack on Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain?”<br/>
<br/>
Although the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain had been toppled by the Iron Flow Military Strategy, because it was shrouded in divine light and protected by divine techniques, the mountain itself remained well preserved, having changed from a vertical stance to lying horizontally. There were limited losses on Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain, and there were still many Dragon King temples, with many stubborn forces firmly defending the area.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi shook his head and said, “Before Du Tiechuan went into seclusion to recuperate, he had issued a military order —to contain but not attack Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain. I am merely overseeing the army; I cannot and do not wish to change that order.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, once the battlefield is cleared, your respective armies will spread out like blooming flowers and swiftly strike the surrounding strongholds.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er furrowed his brows and said, “Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain is the place that must be saved by the Dragon King Temple of Ginseng Whiskers, and Commander Du intends to lure the enemy forces here to conduct a second grand battle.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder he has spent such enormous funds here to build such a sturdy camp. Even now, there are still cultivators continuously working on it.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo added, “Therefore, before the second grand battle, the range of our army’s offensives will also be limited.<br/>
<br/>
There are not many targets in the vicinity that we can attack.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi laughed out loud, “This is all that you have deduced; I haven’t said anything at all. With that, I’ll be off.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Liu Er both rose and followed Zhao Xi, escorting him out of the camp all the way.<br/>
<br/>
At the time of parting, Zhao Xi once again transmitted a thought through his spiritual sense to Ning Zhuo, “By the way, could you perform a divination for the second grand battle?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s previous prophetic poem had been very accurate, leaving Zhao Xi unable to forget it.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately gave a wry smile and said, “This skill of mine can only yield successful divination when I have a genuine premonition; at other times, I am utterly powerless. I hope you can forgive me, sir!”<br/>
<br/>
“Then forget it,” Zhao Xi replied as he mounted a tall horse and departed directly.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er watched Zhao Xi’s departing figure, and at the same time transmitted his thoughts to Ning Zhuo via spiritual sense, thanking him for introducing Zhao Xi to him this time.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo responded silently, “It was also a matter of serendipity. Zhao Xi, in his desire to reap battle merits, took the risk and came to the frontline camp.<br/>
<br/>
Being new on the scene, he had to make a strong impression —as the saying goes, ‘a new official’s first three fires.’<br/>
<br/>
Our matter exactly suited his needs, and that’s why the cooperation was achieved.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er sighed and said, “That said, without the military strategist’s connections and the ingenious contraptions, how could such a result have been achieved?”<br/>
<br/>
With Zhao Xi as such a close connection, even an outsider like Liu Er now had a foothold in the court of the Twin Rivers Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
This was a very significant breakthrough!<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er had been taught by his master since childhood and possessed considerable political talent, which made him understand that he was the one who benefited the most from this matter.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, he, in return for the favor, immediately promised Ning Zhuo, “Military Strategist, no matter how many battle merits the Three Yuan Interlocking Treasure Talisman is worth, I am willing to offer all my battle merits to you. If that is not enough, I will step in and persuade the two worthy brothers to do everything in their power to ensure that you, Military Strategist, get what you desire!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled and, without any objection, replied with just one word, “Good.”<br/>
<br/>
At present, the achievements from cleaning up the battlefield had all been converted into battle merits, which were attributed solely to Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he was the principal general of the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not wish to engage in such attention -seeking actions that would make others envious.<br/>
<br/>
According to the agreement between Ning Zhuo and the Three Generals previously, thirty percent of these battle merits belonged to him.<br/>
<br/>
However, in order to promote Liu Er to the top of the rankings, they had temporarily not distributed them among themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The top position in the rankings would greatly enhance the reputation of the Three Generals Camp, facilitating the subsequent consolidation of the remaining troops.<br/>
<br/>
This was yet another consideration.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The Author’s Note<br/>
<br/>
I haven’t forgotten about the pending updates; they are all recorded in my little notebook, but I need to stabilize the updates first, then plan them gradually.<br/>
<br/>
For the growth of the youth, many things must be explained, especially Ning Zhuo’s mental journey. In fact, a lot has already been reduced in text. If even more is omitted, future plot transitions will be very abrupt.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, it is still a matter of the amount of updates. However, I have been busy with many behind‐the‐scenes tasks recently, making it difficult to find time. In 2024, I made a ten‐year pact with everyone, and 2025 is the first year; indeed, there are many things to do at the beginning of the year.</div>
