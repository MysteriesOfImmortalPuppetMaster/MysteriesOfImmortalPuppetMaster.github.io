<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Pig Hair Giantwood Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Vines and shrubs covered the steep cliffs in dense clusters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In these mountains grew a unique type of pine tree called Pig Hair Pine. Its needles were thick like pig bristles, pale as frost, soft yet extremely tough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The wild boars here often rubbed themselves against these pine trees to relieve itching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Some of their bristles would be scraped off, blend into the soil, and gradually be absorbed by the tree roots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Barbarian-Demon Camp was in a difficult situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The demon cultivators wore lavish attire yet lacked armor, while the barbarian cultivators, though physically powerful, fought in a wild and primitive manner, making coordinated tactics exceedingly challenging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Herds of wild boars poured in from all directions like a tide, covering large swaths of mountainous terrain and repeatedly delivering fierce impacts against the Barbarian-Demon Camp‚Äôs front lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Among these wild boars, there were also many breeds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">There were Iron-Armor Boars, whose bristles were like iron and whose defense was formidable. Their bodies were as large as a small elephant, weighing a thousand jin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">There were also Purple Lightning Boars, agile in form and charged with electricity. When sprinting rapidly on the battlefield, their bristles flickered with thunderous light, their roars echoed like thunder. Upon colliding with an enemy, they brought a violent electric shock that paralyzed the foe on the spot, after which the following herd would trample the victim into pulp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">There were also Bloodfang Boars. Their eyes were all blood-red and their build medium-sized, yet they were the most savage and fierce, utterly unafraid of death when fighting, completely frenzied!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Barbarian-Demon Camp‚Äôs front lines were repeatedly broken, with ever-growing casualties, and morale sank rapidly to rock bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Meanwhile, their commanding general, Xu Dali, was chasing after Ju Bing, the demon cultivator who specialized in beast-taming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ju Bing‚Äôs true form was that of a wild boar. Having cultivated successfully, he assumed a human form. Though his physique was robust, his temperament was extremely shrewd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Seeing Xu Dali charge at him, Ju Bing continually retreated, stalling for time and directing the boar herds, attempting to wipe out the Barbarian-Demon Camp before he personally clashed with Xu Dali!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Just as Ju Bing was close to achieving his tactical goal, a Nascent Soul cultivator and a Golden Core cultivator revealed themselves at the edge of the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">They no longer hid their auras, immediately drawing the attention of both Xu Dali and Ju Bing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The two Nascent Soul-level combatants in the fight both showed deep vigilance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The next moment, the mysterious Nascent Soul cultivator who had appeared clasped his hands and said with a smile, ‚ÄúI am Ding Pi, and this is my young disciple Jia Wan. We have come at the invitation of the King of Two Note Kingdom, joining the army in secret. General Xu, allow us to lend you a hand.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ju Bing‚Äôs expression changed drastically, and he retreated even faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Xu Dali, however, waved a hand. ‚ÄúFellow Daoists, don‚Äôt mind me for now. That fellow over there has thick skin and tough flesh; it won‚Äôt be solved in a short time.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">‚ÄúPlease first lend your strength and save my subordinates!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Nascent Soul cultivator Ding Pi nodded. ‚ÄúGeneral Xu, you treat your troops like your own children ‚Äîadmirable indeed.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Saying this, he looked at his disciple. ‚ÄúLittle Wan, bring out the pot.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Golden Core cultivator Jia Wan looked like a young boy, round of figure, with chubby cheeks. His eyes were clear and lively, brimming with curiosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Jia Wan carried a huge iron wok on his back, like a massive turtle shell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Hearing his master‚Äôs words, he immediately replied crisply, ‚ÄúYes, Master!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He reached to his shoulder, lifted the iron wok from over his head, and set it before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He channeled his power into it, causing the iron wok to float in midair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Next, he reached into the storage pouch at his waist and took out a coal stove.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He lit the stove and placed the iron wok atop it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The coal stove‚Äôs flames roared, soon heating the wok‚Äôs bottom to a glowing red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">A strong aroma of food drifted out, rapidly spreading across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Many barbarian and demon cultivators swallowed their saliva.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">It felt bizarre. They were locked in a fierce life-and-death battle, yet at this moment their stomachs rumbled, gripped by an intense hunger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Not only the Barbarian-Demon Camp but the wild boars as well began drooling one by one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Jia Wan kept busy, taking out three more woks from his storage pouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Each wok was two sizes smaller than the previous one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He then set up a rack, stacking the smaller woks in a tower formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Jia Wan began adding oil, water, various seasonings, spices, vegetables, and so forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">‚ÄúMaster, it‚Äôs almost ready. We just need your meat.‚Äù Jia Wan smacked his lips, swallowing his saliva again and again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ding Pi laughed heartily. ‚ÄúThe meat is here.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">With that, he stretched out his hand and produced a kitchen knife from his storage bracelet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He gripped the knife and slashed diagonally toward the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The blade‚Äôs flash was nearly imperceptible, flickering briefly in midair before disappearing without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">But in the next moment, the wild boars erupted in incomparably tragic howls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Hundreds of boars collapsed, drastically reducing the pressure on the Barbarian-Demon Camp‚Äôs frontline.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ding Pi raised a hand again, and the boar corpses were drawn into the air and slowly flew toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He sliced three more times, his blade light extremely faint. The boar corpses all turned into slices of pork, with skin and bones removed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Thousands upon thousands of slices of pork fell into the large iron wok.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">These raw slices often finished cooking within just a few breaths. The higher the boar‚Äôs cultivation had been in life, the longer it took for its pork to cook.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">However, even a Golden Core-level boar would be fully cooked in thirty breaths, emitting an extremely rich aroma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Jia Wan could not wait any longer. He picked up a pair of treasure-grade chopsticks, squatted beside the wok, clamped slices of pork one after another, and placed them in his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He ate more than twenty slices in a row before finally sighing in satisfaction and standing up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit bland.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He took out some treasured salt and sprinkled over a dozen grains into the wok.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Then he ate another twenty slices of pork, nodding with satisfaction. ‚ÄúMaster, now it tastes just right.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ding Pi swung his blade a dozen more times, single-handedly slaughtering forty percent of the boar herd!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">This time, it was Ju Bing‚Äôs turn to be red-eyed with fury, unable to stay put.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Entangled by Xu Dali, he could not display many of his techniques, causing the boar herd to be effectively powerless in the face of a Nascent Soul-level offensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After all, the wild boars‚Äô intelligence was far inferior to that of human cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Human cultivators could train together and form battle formations, but it was extremely difficult for wild boars to do so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Without a formation, it was nearly impossible to unify their individual strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Another half a cup of tea‚Äôs time passed, and only twenty percent of the original boar herd remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ju Bing let out a mournful roar, ordering the boar herd to abandon the battle and retreat in full.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He himself reverted to his true form, covering the rear for the retreating boars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Xu Dali roared, ‚ÄúSo now it‚Äôs your turn!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">At last, he could hold his head high again, relying on his heavy armor to clash head-on with Ju Bing once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">But having returned to his original form, Ju Bing was as large as a small mountain, hundreds of times stronger than his human shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Xu Dali was sent flying by Ju Bing‚Äôs counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ju Bing also started to withdraw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Jia Wan shrieked, ‚ÄúMaster, that boar is running! That‚Äôs top-quality ingredients!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ding Pi waved a hand at Ju Bing. ‚ÄúKing Boar, Heaven cherishes life. I should not have slaughtered so much of your herd today. Go; I won‚Äôt attack again.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ju Bing froze for a moment, then immediately turned and ran.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Xu Dali tried to give chase, but his speed fell far short, and he could only watch helplessly as Ju Bing‚Äôs figure disappeared among the mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">‚ÄúFellow Daoist Ding Pi, you‚Äôve let a huge amount of battle credit slip away.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Xu Dali felt immense gratitude toward Ding Pi and Jia Wan, yet also some vexation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ding Pi simply smiled and sat cross-legged on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Jia Wan said angrily, ‚ÄúGeneral Xu, I said that on purpose just now. My master and I basically wiped out the majority of the boars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">‚ÄúThey barely have any fighting power left.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Xu Dali suddenly realized that Jia Wan had just been bluffing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He hurriedly cupped his hands, publicly thanking the master and disciple. ‚ÄúAlthough Ju Bing escaped, he is a beast-taming cultivator, and most of his strength lay in the boars. With such a heavy loss, he won‚Äôt regain his peak anytime soon.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ding Pi smiled. ‚ÄúGeneral Xu, the one you should truly thank is not me, but Commander Du.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">‚ÄúIt was Commander Du who secretly dispatched us, subtly following you and protecting you behind the scenes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">‚ÄúHe also instructed us that, upon encountering the enemy, we could act as we saw fit.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Xu Dali looked astonished. ‚ÄúSo it was Commander Du!?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">‚ÄúI thought we four armies were just pawns for probing the enemy‚Äôs strength.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ding Pi said, ‚ÄúIn a great war, we are all pieces on the board, and Commander Du is the player.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">‚ÄúFrom this battle, it‚Äôs clear that Commander Du has outplayed the enemy.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Xu Dali nodded and sighed, his face filled with complicated emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">After thinking for a moment, he suddenly asked, ‚ÄúSo that means the other three forces also have experts like you secretly protecting them?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ding Pi paused, surprised that Xu Dali only realized this now. He smiled slightly and nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Dice Bone Giantwood Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Three Generals Camp was besieged round after round by poison techniques, their situation precarious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Liu Er was covered in poison sores, weak and agitated, and said to Ning Zhuo, ‚ÄúMilitary Adviser, your puppet army isn‚Äôt afraid of these poison techniques. Now‚Äôs your time to shine!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Guan Hong chimed in, ‚ÄúMilitary Adviser, please dispatch your troops quickly.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zhang Hei gave a dark chuckle, offering encouragement. ‚ÄúMilitary Adviser, show them your might!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">All three generals used divine sense transmissions in succession to urge Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">But Ning Zhuo shook his head, face pale. ‚ÄúThat would be unwise.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">‚ÄúI have a premonition that if I deploy the puppet army alone, I‚Äôll be exploited by the enemy, and the consequences will be dire!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Compared to the Three Generals, Ning Zhuo, although also afflicted with poison sores, had far fewer on his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This was because his physical foundation was not nearly as strong as that of the Three Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs premonition originated from nothing else but his mechanism ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He had long considered going out alone to command a troop by himself, but whenever this idea surfaced and he tried to act on it, the ring on his finger would tighten fiercely, without fail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">This warning was already plain enough. Naturally, Ning Zhuo went with the flow. Even though the Three Generals Camp was in a critical state, he stayed within the battle formation, showing no intention whatsoever of venturing out to fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Liu Er found it intolerable, his hatred for Ning Zhuo flaring up wildly inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">‚ÄúMilitary Adviser, you built that army yourself. You poured so much money into it.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">‚ÄúIf you let them all be sacrificed, won‚Äôt all your efforts go to waste?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo waved a hand, smiling. ‚ÄúThank you for your concern, Lord Liu. A bit of money is no matter. If necessary, tripling, quintupling, or even tenfolding that sum would be quite easy.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù Liu Er was speechless, his anger rising further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He was about to speak again when a clear current swept across the battlefield, sharply reducing the poisonous miasma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">‚ÄúWho goes there?!‚Äù Tu Ming‚Äôs expression changed dramatically, his sinister eyes fixed on the sky above the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">A female cultivator slowly revealed her true form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">She had a slender figure and a fair countenance. Her black hair‚Äîdark as ink‚Äîwas styled into a high bun, adorned with a delicate silver hairpin that dangled a red pearl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">She wore a plain white brocade robe, with a silver chain at her waist suspending an exquisite jade bottle, and on her feet were a pair of emerald embroidered shoes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Her expression was cool and aloof as she looked down on Tu Ming. ‚ÄúShen Qinghe.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Tu Ming‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">‚ÄúShen Qinghe?!‚Äù Diao Ye and Wu Lan exclaimed simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Tu Ming took a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a cultivator from the Embroidery Kingdom. Why stick your nose into the affairs of Two Note Kingdom?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Shen Qinghe remained expressionless. ‚ÄúI have sworn to eradicate all poison cultivators beneath the sky, and so I came at the invitation to fight. Tu Ming, prepare to die.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">She raised her slender jade-like finger and pointed toward Tu Ming from afar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Medical Technique‚ÄîC«éo C«éo Li«éo (brief remedy) Finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">A bit of green radiance flew out from her fingertip. Though it appeared gentle, it moved with startling speed, reaching Tu Ming in the blink of an eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Tu Ming retreated at once, defending with all his might and deploying nearly ten protective spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Useless!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The green radiance easily dissolved each layer of defense, effortlessly as if drinking water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">It penetrated deeply and took root in Tu Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Tu Ming‚Äôs expression changed dramatically as he sensed his poison-cultivation power quickly being nullified, horror gripping him. ‚ÄúSo it really is the Green Spirit Toxin-Cleansing Sutra!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">This cultivation method‚Äôs power was overwhelmingly suppressive to poison cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">As a result, anyone who practiced it was a thorn in the side of every poison cultivator in the world, hated to the core, and they would not rest until such a person was killed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Clearly, Shen Qinghe‚Äôs level ‚ÄîNascent Soul ‚Äîwas beyond what Tu Ming could handle, especially as she was a famed healer-cultivator of the Embroidery Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Tu Ming‚Äôs sole option was to run!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">He fled with everything he had.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Shen Qinghe pursued relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Both soon disappeared beyond the mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">‚ÄúCounterattack!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">‚ÄúKill! Kill them!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Guan Hong and Zhang Hei bellowed almost in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">With the absence of a Nascent Soul-level adversary, the Three Generals Camp launched a fierce counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Diao Ye and Wu Lan lost their will to fight and both tried to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">‚ÄúWhere do you think you‚Äôre going?!‚Äù Ning Zhuo tested for a moment, found the mechanism ring unresponsive, and rushed out at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">While in mid-sprint, he retrieved a large number of puppet automatons from his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">These automatons assembled into an army, swiftly forming a battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Formation ‚ÄîLightbody Swiftwind Array!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The puppet army‚Äôs speed skyrocketed, immediately leaving the Three Generals Camp behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Still in their Iron Barrel formation, the Three Generals Camp needed to switch to a Triangular Arrow formation in order to gain enough speed for pursuit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs puppet army charged at Wu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Wu Lan dared not meet their sharp offensive head-on, continually falling back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Ning Zhuo then took the initiative to enter the poisonous fog, allowing it to corrode and destroy many of the puppet automatons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs own combat power surged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Very soon, he once again possessed Golden Core-level strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">With this boost, Ning Zhuo wielded Five Elements spells repeatedly, posing a severe threat to both Wu Lan and Diao Ye!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Diao Ye hid within the poisonous fog, making him temporarily hard to locate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Ning Zhuo focused on pursuing Wu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Hampered by various Five Elements spells, Wu Lan ultimately fell into the encirclement of the puppet automatons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Large numbers of automatons attacked Wu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Wu Lan was adept at offense but lacked the means to let go of that offense for proper defense, struggling desperately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Many puppets were destroyed, and Wu Lan came close to breaking out several times, only for Ning Zhuo‚Äôs Five Elements spells to force him back in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Meng Y√®hu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">Night-Stalking Thorn-Back Diagram!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">When the moment was right, Meng Y√®hu suddenly struck from behind, and the Nether Slaughter Claw pierced through Wu Lan‚Äôs heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Wu Lan fell in battle!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
