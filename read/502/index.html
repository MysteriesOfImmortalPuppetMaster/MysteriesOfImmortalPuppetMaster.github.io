<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Pig Hair Giantwood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Vines and shrubs covered the steep cliffs in dense clusters.<br/>
<br/>
In these mountains grew a unique type of pine tree called Pig Hair Pine. Its needles were thick like pig bristles, pale as frost, soft yet extremely tough.<br/>
<br/>
The wild boars here often rubbed themselves against these pine trees to relieve itching.<br/>
<br/>
Some of their bristles would be scraped off, blend into the soil, and gradually be absorbed by the tree roots.<br/>
<br/>
The Barbarian-Demon Camp was in a difficult situation.<br/>
<br/>
The demon cultivators wore lavish attire yet lacked armor, while the barbarian cultivators, though physically powerful, fought in a wild and primitive manner, making coordinated tactics exceedingly challenging.<br/>
<br/>
Herds of wild boars poured in from all directions like a tide, covering large swaths of mountainous terrain and repeatedly delivering fierce impacts against the Barbarian-Demon Camp‚Äôs front lines.<br/>
<br/>
Among these wild boars, there were also many breeds.<br/>
<br/>
There were Iron-Armor Boars, whose bristles were like iron and whose defense was formidable. Their bodies were as large as a small elephant, weighing a thousand jin.<br/>
<br/>
There were also Purple Lightning Boars, agile in form and charged with electricity. When sprinting rapidly on the battlefield, their bristles flickered with thunderous light, their roars echoed like thunder. Upon colliding with an enemy, they brought a violent electric shock that paralyzed the foe on the spot, after which the following herd would trample the victim into pulp.<br/>
<br/>
There were also Bloodfang Boars. Their eyes were all blood-red and their build medium-sized, yet they were the most savage and fierce, utterly unafraid of death when fighting, completely frenzied!<br/>
<br/>
The Barbarian-Demon Camp‚Äôs front lines were repeatedly broken, with ever-growing casualties, and morale sank rapidly to rock bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, their commanding general, Xu Dali, was chasing after Ju Bing, the demon cultivator who specialized in beast-taming.<br/>
<br/>
Ju Bing‚Äôs true form was that of a wild boar. Having cultivated successfully, he assumed a human form. Though his physique was robust, his temperament was extremely shrewd.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Xu Dali charge at him, Ju Bing continually retreated, stalling for time and directing the boar herds, attempting to wipe out the Barbarian-Demon Camp before he personally clashed with Xu Dali!<br/>
<br/>
Just as Ju Bing was close to achieving his tactical goal, a Nascent Soul cultivator and a Golden Core cultivator revealed themselves at the edge of the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
They no longer hid their auras, immediately drawing the attention of both Xu Dali and Ju Bing.<br/>
<br/>
The two Nascent Soul-level combatants in the fight both showed deep vigilance.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, the mysterious Nascent Soul cultivator who had appeared clasped his hands and said with a smile, ‚ÄúI am Ding Pi, and this is my young disciple Jia Wan. We have come at the invitation of the King of Twin Rivers Kingdom, joining the army in secret. General Xu, allow us to lend you a hand.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ju Bing‚Äôs expression changed drastically, and he retreated even faster.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali, however, waved a hand. ‚ÄúFellow Daoists, don‚Äôt mind me for now. That fellow over there has thick skin and tough flesh; it won‚Äôt be solved in a short time.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúPlease first lend your strength and save my subordinates!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul cultivator Ding Pi nodded. ‚ÄúGeneral Xu, you treat your troops like your own children ‚Äîadmirable indeed.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Saying this, he looked at his disciple. ‚ÄúLittle Wan, bring out the pot.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core cultivator Jia Wan looked like a young boy, round of figure, with chubby cheeks. His eyes were clear and lively, brimming with curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
Jia Wan carried a huge iron wok on his back, like a massive turtle shell.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing his master‚Äôs words, he immediately replied crisply, ‚ÄúYes, Master!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
He reached to his shoulder, lifted the iron wok from over his head, and set it before him.<br/>
<br/>
He channeled his power into it, causing the iron wok to float in midair.<br/>
<br/>
Next, he reached into the storage pouch at his waist and took out a coal stove.<br/>
<br/>
He lit the stove and placed the iron wok atop it.<br/>
<br/>
The coal stove‚Äôs flames roared, soon heating the wok‚Äôs bottom to a glowing red.<br/>
<br/>
A strong aroma of food drifted out, rapidly spreading across the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Many barbarian and demon cultivators swallowed their saliva.<br/>
<br/>
It felt bizarre. They were locked in a fierce life-and-death battle, yet at this moment their stomachs rumbled, gripped by an intense hunger.<br/>
<br/>
Not only the Barbarian-Demon Camp but the wild boars as well began drooling one by one.<br/>
<br/>
Jia Wan kept busy, taking out three more woks from his storage pouch.<br/>
<br/>
Each wok was two sizes smaller than the previous one.<br/>
<br/>
He then set up a rack, stacking the smaller woks in a tower formation.<br/>
<br/>
Jia Wan began adding oil, water, various seasonings, spices, vegetables, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúMaster, it‚Äôs almost ready. We just need your meat.‚Äù Jia Wan smacked his lips, swallowing his saliva again and again.<br/>
<br/>
Ding Pi laughed heartily. ‚ÄúThe meat is here.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
With that, he stretched out his hand and produced a kitchen knife from his storage bracelet.<br/>
<br/>
He gripped the knife and slashed diagonally toward the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The blade‚Äôs flash was nearly imperceptible, flickering briefly in midair before disappearing without a trace.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, the wild boars erupted in incomparably tragic howls.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of boars collapsed, drastically reducing the pressure on the Barbarian-Demon Camp‚Äôs frontline.<br/>
<br/>
Ding Pi raised a hand again, and the boar corpses were drawn into the air and slowly flew toward him.<br/>
<br/>
He sliced three more times, his blade light extremely faint. The boar corpses all turned into slices of pork, with skin and bones removed.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands upon thousands of slices of pork fell into the large iron wok.<br/>
<br/>
These raw slices often finished cooking within just a few breaths. The higher the boar‚Äôs cultivation had been in life, the longer it took for its pork to cook.<br/>
<br/>
However, even a Golden Core-level boar would be fully cooked in thirty breaths, emitting an extremely rich aroma.<br/>
<br/>
Jia Wan could not wait any longer. He picked up a pair of treasure-grade chopsticks, squatted beside the wok, clamped slices of pork one after another, and placed them in his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
He ate more than twenty slices in a row before finally sighing in satisfaction and standing up.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit bland.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
He took out some treasured salt and sprinkled over a dozen grains into the wok.<br/>
<br/>
Then he ate another twenty slices of pork, nodding with satisfaction. ‚ÄúMaster, now it tastes just right.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ding Pi swung his blade a dozen more times, single-handedly slaughtering forty percent of the boar herd!<br/>
<br/>
This time, it was Ju Bing‚Äôs turn to be red-eyed with fury, unable to stay put.<br/>
<br/>
Entangled by Xu Dali, he could not display many of his techniques, causing the boar herd to be effectively powerless in the face of a Nascent Soul-level offensive.<br/>
<br/>
After all, the wild boars‚Äô intelligence was far inferior to that of human cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Human cultivators could train together and form battle formations, but it was extremely difficult for wild boars to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Without a formation, it was nearly impossible to unify their individual strength.<br/>
<br/>
Another half a cup of tea‚Äôs time passed, and only twenty percent of the original boar herd remained.<br/>
<br/>
Ju Bing let out a mournful roar, ordering the boar herd to abandon the battle and retreat in full.<br/>
<br/>
He himself reverted to his true form, covering the rear for the retreating boars.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali roared, ‚ÄúSo now it‚Äôs your turn!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
At last, he could hold his head high again, relying on his heavy armor to clash head-on with Ju Bing once more.<br/>
<br/>
But having returned to his original form, Ju Bing was as large as a small mountain, hundreds of times stronger than his human shape.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali was sent flying by Ju Bing‚Äôs counterattack.<br/>
<br/>
Ju Bing also started to withdraw.<br/>
<br/>
Jia Wan shrieked, ‚ÄúMaster, that boar is running! That‚Äôs top-quality ingredients!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ding Pi waved a hand at Ju Bing. ‚ÄúKing Boar, Heaven cherishes life. I should not have slaughtered so much of your herd today. Go; I won‚Äôt attack again.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ju Bing froze for a moment, then immediately turned and ran.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali tried to give chase, but his speed fell far short, and he could only watch helplessly as Ju Bing‚Äôs figure disappeared among the mountains.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúFellow Daoist Ding Pi, you‚Äôve let a huge amount of battle credit slip away.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali felt immense gratitude toward Ding Pi and Jia Wan, yet also some vexation.<br/>
<br/>
Ding Pi simply smiled and sat cross-legged on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Jia Wan said angrily, ‚ÄúGeneral Xu, I said that on purpose just now. My master and I basically wiped out the majority of the boars.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúThey barely have any fighting power left.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali suddenly realized that Jia Wan had just been bluffing.<br/>
<br/>
He hurriedly cupped his hands, publicly thanking the master and disciple. ‚ÄúAlthough Ju Bing escaped, he is a beast-taming cultivator, and most of his strength lay in the boars. With such a heavy loss, he won‚Äôt regain his peak anytime soon.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ding Pi smiled. ‚ÄúGeneral Xu, the one you should truly thank is not me, but Commander Du.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúIt was Commander Du who secretly dispatched us, subtly following you and protecting you behind the scenes.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúHe also instructed us that, upon encountering the enemy, we could act as we saw fit.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali looked astonished. ‚ÄúSo it was Commander Du!?‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúI thought we four armies were just pawns for probing the enemy‚Äôs strength.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ding Pi said, ‚ÄúIn a great war, we are all pieces on the board, and Commander Du is the player.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúFrom this battle, it‚Äôs clear that Commander Du has outplayed the enemy.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali nodded and sighed, his face filled with complicated emotions.<br/>
<br/>
After thinking for a moment, he suddenly asked, ‚ÄúSo that means the other three forces also have experts like you secretly protecting them?‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ding Pi paused, surprised that Xu Dali only realized this now. He smiled slightly and nodded.<br/>
<br/>
Dice Bone Giantwood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp was besieged round after round by poison techniques, their situation precarious.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was covered in poison sores, weak and agitated, and said to Ning Zhuo, ‚ÄúMilitary Adviser, your puppet army isn‚Äôt afraid of these poison techniques. Now‚Äôs your time to shine!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong chimed in, ‚ÄúMilitary Adviser, please dispatch your troops quickly.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei gave a dark chuckle, offering encouragement. ‚ÄúMilitary Adviser, show them your might!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
All three generals used divine sense transmissions in succession to urge Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo shook his head, face pale. ‚ÄúThat would be unwise.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúI have a premonition that if I deploy the puppet army alone, I‚Äôll be exploited by the enemy, and the consequences will be dire!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the Three Generals, Ning Zhuo, although also afflicted with poison sores, had far fewer on his body.<br/>
<br/>
This was because his physical foundation was not nearly as strong as that of the Three Generals.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs premonition originated from nothing else but his mechanism ring.<br/>
<br/>
He had long considered going out alone to command a troop by himself, but whenever this idea surfaced and he tried to act on it, the ring on his finger would tighten fiercely, without fail.<br/>
<br/>
This warning was already plain enough. Naturally, Ning Zhuo went with the flow. Even though the Three Generals Camp was in a critical state, he stayed within the battle formation, showing no intention whatsoever of venturing out to fight.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er found it intolerable, his hatred for Ning Zhuo flaring up wildly inside.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúMilitary Adviser, you built that army yourself. You poured so much money into it.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúIf you let them all be sacrificed, won‚Äôt all your efforts go to waste?‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo waved a hand, smiling. ‚ÄúThank you for your concern, Lord Liu. A bit of money is no matter. If necessary, tripling, quintupling, or even tenfolding that sum would be quite easy.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù Liu Er was speechless, his anger rising further.<br/>
<br/>
He was about to speak again when a clear current swept across the battlefield, sharply reducing the poisonous miasma.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúWho goes there?!‚Äù Tu Ming‚Äôs expression changed dramatically, his sinister eyes fixed on the sky above the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
A female cultivator slowly revealed her true form.<br/>
<br/>
She had a slender figure and a fair countenance. Her black hair‚Äîdark as ink‚Äîwas styled into a high bun, adorned with a delicate silver hairpin that dangled a red pearl.<br/>
<br/>
She wore a plain white brocade robe, with a silver chain at her waist suspending an exquisite jade bottle, and on her feet were a pair of emerald embroidered shoes.<br/>
<br/>
Her expression was cool and aloof as she looked down on Tu Ming. ‚ÄúShen Qinghe.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúShen Qinghe?!‚Äù Diao Ye and Wu Lan exclaimed simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming took a deep breath. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a cultivator from the Embroidery Kingdom. Why stick your nose into the affairs of Twin Rivers Kingdom?‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Shen Qinghe remained expressionless. ‚ÄúI have sworn to eradicate all poison cultivators beneath the sky, and so I came at the invitation to fight. Tu Ming, prepare to die.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
She raised her slender jade-like finger and pointed toward Tu Ming from afar.<br/>
<br/>
Medical Technique‚ÄîC«éo C«éo Li«éo (brief remedy) Finger.<br/>
<br/>
A bit of green radiance flew out from her fingertip. Though it appeared gentle, it moved with startling speed, reaching Tu Ming in the blink of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming retreated at once, defending with all his might and deploying nearly ten protective spells.<br/>
<br/>
Useless!<br/>
<br/>
The green radiance easily dissolved each layer of defense, effortlessly as if drinking water.<br/>
<br/>
It penetrated deeply and took root in Tu Ming.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming‚Äôs expression changed dramatically as he sensed his poison-cultivation power quickly being nullified, horror gripping him. ‚ÄúSo it really is the Green Spirit Toxin-Cleansing Sutra!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
This cultivation method‚Äôs power was overwhelmingly suppressive to poison cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, anyone who practiced it was a thorn in the side of every poison cultivator in the world, hated to the core, and they would not rest until such a person was killed.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, Shen Qinghe‚Äôs level ‚ÄîNascent Soul ‚Äîwas beyond what Tu Ming could handle, especially as she was a famed healer-cultivator of the Embroidery Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming‚Äôs sole option was to run!<br/>
<br/>
He fled with everything he had.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Qinghe pursued relentlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Both soon disappeared beyond the mountains.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúCounterattack!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúKill! Kill them!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong and Zhang Hei bellowed almost in unison.<br/>
<br/>
With the absence of a Nascent Soul-level adversary, the Three Generals Camp launched a fierce counterattack.<br/>
<br/>
Diao Ye and Wu Lan lost their will to fight and both tried to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúWhere do you think you‚Äôre going?!‚Äù Ning Zhuo tested for a moment, found the mechanism ring unresponsive, and rushed out at once.<br/>
<br/>
While in mid-sprint, he retrieved a large number of puppet automatons from his storage belt.<br/>
<br/>
These automatons assembled into an army, swiftly forming a battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
Formation ‚ÄîLightbody Swiftwind Array!<br/>
<br/>
The puppet army‚Äôs speed skyrocketed, immediately leaving the Three Generals Camp behind.<br/>
<br/>
Still in their Iron Barrel formation, the Three Generals Camp needed to switch to a Triangular Arrow formation in order to gain enough speed for pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs puppet army charged at Wu Lan.<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan dared not meet their sharp offensive head-on, continually falling back.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then took the initiative to enter the poisonous fog, allowing it to corrode and destroy many of the puppet automatons.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs own combat power surged!<br/>
<br/>
Very soon, he once again possessed Golden Core-level strength.<br/>
<br/>
With this boost, Ning Zhuo wielded Five Elements spells repeatedly, posing a severe threat to both Wu Lan and Diao Ye!<br/>
<br/>
Diao Ye hid within the poisonous fog, making him temporarily hard to locate.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo focused on pursuing Wu Lan.<br/>
<br/>
Hampered by various Five Elements spells, Wu Lan ultimately fell into the encirclement of the puppet automatons.<br/>
<br/>
Large numbers of automatons attacked Wu Lan.<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan was adept at offense but lacked the means to let go of that offense for proper defense, struggling desperately.<br/>
<br/>
Many puppets were destroyed, and Wu Lan came close to breaking out several times, only for Ning Zhuo‚Äôs Five Elements spells to force him back in.<br/>
<br/>

When the moment was right, Meng Y√®hu suddenly struck from behind, and the Nether Slaughter Claw pierced through Wu Lan‚Äôs heart.<br/>
