<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 262: Where is the True Mastermind Behind the Scenes?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Almost all the invited guests had arrived, and the presiding elder took the stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The crowd quickly quieted down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Presiding Elder: "Honored guests, today we gather here not only to converse as colleagues and friends but also to celebrate a virtuous act for the common people. Before his death, Old Director Li Leifeng was still concerned about the issue of his successor. Now, it has been most appropriately resolved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Lord Zhu Hou, hailing from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, is renowned for his benevolence and magnanimity. He will inherit the children's orphanage and take on the role of director. Let us invite Lord Zhu to the stage to share his words of wisdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">A middle-aged man, broad and stout, with a smile on his face, walked onto the stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Today, Zhu Hou was dressed in a satin robe, with a jade pendant at his waist, and his steps were steady.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">His every move exuded the grace of the Zhu royal family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He stood on the stage, cupped his hands in salute, and looked around, letting out a hearty laugh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Fellow Daoists, I am truly humbled to assume the position of director of the children's orphanage today. The path of charity is to seek blessings for the common people and to spread benevolence. The benevolent heart of former Director Li Leifeng deeply moves me. Today, I shall carry on his mission and continue to promote this virtuous cause."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"In the future, our orphanage will expand its support to orphans and even impoverished students. The donations from all you benevolent individuals will be used entirely for the benefit of the people, to aid the common folk. Moreover, I am willing to lead by example and donate one hundred thousand spirit stones to express my sincerity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Zhu Hou organized this succession ceremony with a clear purpose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The main goal was to formally make his debut and to raise the first charitable fund since taking office.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">As soon as he finished speaking, Zhu Xuanji's voice came from the third floor: "Well said, Uncle Zhu! I, Zhu Xuanji, also donate one hundred thousand spirit stones to congratulate my uncle on his succession." Zhu Xuanji came here with the intention of supporting and endorsing Zhu Hou, and he did not hesitate to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">His donation amount was interesting, exactly one hundred thousand spirit stones, just like Zhu Hou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">This made the other attendees feel relieved, without any pressure, and instead eager to make their own donations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">However, these people understood the rules and did not immediately speak up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">They were waiting for another person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The next moment, the Golden Core true disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion indeed spoke, announcing a donation of one hundred thousand spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">As soon as he finished, Foundation Establishment cultivators began to shout eagerly, and the sounds of donations echoed continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">For a moment, the eastern part of the building was very lively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">However, the atmosphere inside the private box was oppressive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo sat in the position below Zhu Xuanji, and after sitting down, he remained silent, not touching the exquisite spiritual food and tea on the round table even once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zhu Xuanji slightly turned his head, his eyes with a hint of golden light staring at Ning Zhuo, smiling: "Seeing this scene now, Ning Zhuo, what do you feel?" Ning Zhuo raised his eyes to look at Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The latter's smile, in Ning Zhuo's perception, seemed like a ferocious beast's gaping maw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo felt as if a huge stone was pressing on his heart, but his gaze did not waver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He calmly spoke: "I naturally hope that Lord Zhu Hou can do as he says. I hope the children's orphanage in Fire Persimmon Immortal City can become better and better." "It will," Zhu Xuanji immediately replied, full of confidence in Zhu Hou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The smile on his face deepened: "I saw your name in the donation records of the orphanage. You have donated several times in the past. Why not donate a little on such an important day today?" Ning Zhuo took a deep breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He tried to calm himself, but the pressure in his heart only increased! Because he knew very well that Zhu Xuanji's seemingly ordinary question concealed a huge threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">A slight misstep in response could lead him into a trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This was the beginning of his confrontation with Zhu Xuanji! The excitement outside had nothing to do with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Instead, the noise highlighted his current loneliness and hardship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Zhu Xuanji was like a skilled assassin, delivering a sword move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">On the surface, it seemed ordinary, but Ning Zhuo was certain that the other party had a brilliant follow-up move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">If he responded incorrectly, one wrong step could lead to complete suppression, with no hope of victory!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo frowned slightly, his mind racing with thoughts, quickly choosing his words carefully: "To cultivate oneself and benefit the world. Although I am pragmatic, I also have ideals. Moreover, in my childhood, I was under the care of Lord Li Leifeng, to whom I owe a debt of gratitude." Then, Ning Zhuo changed his tone: "Of course, I also have selfish motives. You know, I want to establish my own family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"I want to build my own clan! I have been working towards this, but for a force to grow, fresh blood and external talents are necessary. Especially for someone like me, who is just starting out, with shallow foundations, the more newcomers, the better! That's why I have been donating in the past. There will be more such donations in the future!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo smiled briefly, then immediately became expressionless: "The orphanage's policy is excellent, recruiting many talents for the righteous forces of the Southern Bean Kingdom. I am a member of the Ning family, and I am also part of the righteous path, so of course, I want a share of the love. You see, Lord Zhu, I have paid, which is in line with the rules. As for why I am not donating today? Ha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Today is not suitable. I am currently managing the black market, and my righteous identity is not so glamorous, so I won't be the one to spoil this atmosphere. If I want to donate, I can do it secretly in the future and still achieve my goals. Why do something so unpopular?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">After hearing Ning Zhuo's response, Zhu Xuanji fell into a brief silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo's desire to establish his own family and build his own force was something Zhu Xuanji was well aware of.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo had brought up this matter multiple times in front of him, even daring to speak to his own Golden Core ancestor, Ning Jiufan, in such a manner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Even Zhu Xuanji admired Ning Zhuo's courage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">To be precise, he admired him greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Especially after hearing Ning Zhuo's response, he gained a deeper understanding of Ning Zhuoâ€”this young man had definitely been tempered by experience! He was well-versed in the rules of the righteous path's game, and despite his youth, he was as cunning and seasoned as an old fox.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He had very clear goals, cared about others' feelings, and could empathize.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo was both hypocritical and sincere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This kind of hypocrisy of the righteous path, when placed on this young boy, actually had a certain charm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo's response was excellent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This answer increased Zhu Xuanji's favorable impression of him significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Zhu Xuanji laughed heartily, breaking the silence: "Even with selfish motives, as long as you know gratitude and repay kindness, it is the righteous path. In this world, who doesn't have selfish motives? Even I, who constantly observes the people's sentiments, investigates cases, and pursues criminals, do so partly to protect the royal family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Ning Zhuo, you have a good nature, act righteously, and have a bright future. However, in life, there are countless wrong paths. I have seen many inherently kind people who, due to a moment's lapse, took the wrong path and committed sins. By the time they regretted it, it was already too late."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">At this point, Zhu Xuanji stared at Ning Zhuo, his face solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Without using any magical power, he exuded a strong oppressive force through his tone and demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, avoiding eye contact, as if a bolt of lightning flashed through his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He quickly discerned Zhu Xuanji's intention: "Is he trying to recruit me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Realizing this, Ning Zhuo's heart became lively. "If Zhu Xuanji had discovered I was the mastermind, he wouldn't treat me like this but would capture me directly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Based on his character, he must have found some suspicious points about me but wants to use me as a lead to catch the real culprit behind the scenes!" But where is there a real culprit behind the scenes?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo was the one who orchestrated the explosion at the Lava Immortal Palace, set up the trial checkpoints, initiated the city battle to kill Cheng Bai, framed his own family's genius Ning Xiaohui, directed the Golden Core melee, bombarded the volcano leading to the demon beast tide attacking the city, and planned the cloud merchant robbery case!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"I hold great value in Zhu Xuanji's eyes, and he wants to turn me. If there truly were a mastermind, he might even use me as a witness." "So, has it reached the third line of defense?" Ning Zhuo's emotions fluctuated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">To compete for the Lava Immortal Palace, he had meticulously crafted several lines of defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The first line of defense was from opening four cores at the age of two, continuously creating various pieces of evidence scattered throughout his growth trajectory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Investigators would conclude that Ning Zhuo had a talent for mechanical constructs, making it reasonable for him to develop mechanical fire monkeys and the like.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The second line of defense was the identity of Chui Xu Ke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The third line of defense would make them believe Ning Zhuo was being used, a secondary accomplice, but not the mastermind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">After all, this young man was only sixteen, just out of school, and only at the mid-stage of Qi Refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo slightly relaxed, the situation hadn't deteriorated to the final stepâ€”using force to confront Zhu Xuanji directly. "But what clues did Zhu Xuanji obtain to bypass the second line of defense and reach the third?" Ning Zhuo couldn't figure out the answer to this question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He could only speculate: "Did Han Ming get captured? Did Sun Lingtong's treasure theft lead to clues from the cloud merchants?" "Or... the children's orphanage?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lacking critical information, even with his considerable intellect, Ning Zhuo couldn't ascertain the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He thought intensely, sweat appearing on his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Zhu Xuanji, seeing his embarrassed state, didn't let him off, pressing further: "What insights do you have about my earlier words, Ning Zhuo?" "Do you think your path is the right one or a wrong path?" Ning Zhuo felt immense pressure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">At this moment, he felt as if Zhu Xuanji had thrust a sword to his throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">How to respond? This was crucial!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">To probe? A slight misstep could anger Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">To remain silent? That would completely relinquish initiative, conveying tacit agreement to Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">In Ning Zhuo's mind, countless ineffective thoughts arose and vanished rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">In just a few breaths, he felt parched.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
