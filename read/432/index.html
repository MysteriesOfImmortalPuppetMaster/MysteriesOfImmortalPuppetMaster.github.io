<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Liu Er came to the outside of the training ground and transmitted his thoughts through divine sense to summon Guan Hong and Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He told them about Ning Zhuo's proposal and asked for their opinions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zhang Hei did not hesitate: "I will follow eldest brother!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Although he had just met Liu Er, during these days of interaction and frequent daily training, they gradually developed a mutual understanding, and the brotherhood sworn between them was rapidly heating up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Expressed outwardly, Zhang Hei became increasingly obedient to Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Guan Hong pondered for a moment before saying: "This person Ning Zhuo is from a great clan. At such a young age, he already has Foundation Establishment cultivation and can easily produce Nascent Soul-level precious materials. His background is profound and cannot be treated with common sense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"I observed his actions and saw that he acts with purpose. In dealing with others, he is quite bold. Managing our army's ledgers, he is also diligent and conscientious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Our army's military funds are tight. Ning Zhuo manages the accounts and is clearer than us, understanding the severe situation before us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Under such circumstances, he still proposes to set up an array for divination, which shows that he really has a bad premonition!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Although I don't know how profound his divination method is, judging by his temperament, he must have some confidence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"We are facing a great battle. If we can know in advance how the situation will develop, we will have a great advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Liu Er listened carefully and nodded: "I understand the thoughts of my two sworn brothers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Even if Ning Zhuo's divination fails, it's worth a try!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"I will go back and inform the strategist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Although Ning Zhuo was inside the tent, he had been using the Life Hanging by a Thread technique to secretly listen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He did not use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and still gained Guan Hong's support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">This was slightly beyond his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He had originally thought that his relationship with Zhang Hei was the best and that the latter would speak for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">On the contrary, Zhang Hei followed Liu Er's lead and did not say a word for Ning Zhuo. Instead, it was Guan Hong, who usually had a cold relationship with him, who spoke some words and strongly supported Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Soon, Liu Er lifted the tent flap and came to Ning Zhuo again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Good news! My two sworn brothers share my thoughts and both support you, strategist, in performing divination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"I wonder what arrangements the strategist has and specifically what assistance we can provide; please tell us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Seeing Liu Er's smiling face and utmost friendliness, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but secretly sigh at this person's social skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He slightly shook his head: "For this array setup and divination, I must act in secret to prevent the leakage of the technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Liu Er suddenly realized and hurriedly cupped his hands: "It was my rudeness; strategist, please forgive me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Many secret techniques were quite valuable and wouldn't be easily shown to outsiders. Ning Zhuo stated that since the three generals agreed, he would act immediately, first go to purchase materials, then go out of the city alone to set up the array and perform the calculation. Whether he could calculate anything or not, he would promptly report to Lord Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Speaking of this, Ning Zhuo hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Liu Er said: "Strategist, feel free to speak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo then expressed that he felt something was amiss. Matters of war concern life and death and one should plan for defeat before planning for victory. He suggested that the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang should train more in formations that could be quickly deployed and changed, convenient for rapid movement on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Liu Er's expression moved slightly, and he nodded gently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">After Ning Zhuo left the military camp, Liu Er re-entered the training manual. He called the entire army to stop and announced additional training in the "One-Line Snake Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo went straight to Green Forest Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In the "Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon," Sun Lingtong saw that Ning Zhuo acted with measure and couldn't help but curiously ask: "Little Zhuo, your mind is sharp. Have you already thought of a way to break the situation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo slightly nodded: "It's not exactly a way to break the situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"I've thought it over; we are all bound by the divine decree."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Since we cannot seek help from the military of Two Note Country, we must act according to the divine decree."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"This is actually okay!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"We are now cultivators of Southern Bean Kingdom. Two Note Country borders Southern Bean Kingdom. If they lose more in the war against Thousand Peaks Forest, it is also beneficial to our Southern Bean Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Moreover, before Zhu Xuanji left, he specifically told me that some forces in Thousand Peaks Forest are funded by the Southern Bean Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang have a good relationship with us. At that time, we can just avoid these people!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo was just an outsider and had no sense of belonging to Two Note Country.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The reason he joined them was merely to heal Sun Lingtong and to plan for his own mechanism carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lingtong breathed a sigh of relief: "Little Zhuo, it's good that you can think this way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo continued: "The next problem is how we participate in the ambush."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"At that time, we two cannot show up and must hide inside the stone sphere."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"But the stone sphere cannot move by itself, so I plan to transform it into a mechanical creation to help us disguise better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"By the way. The divine decree requires us to go all out; we had better do our best."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"But don't forget, we only have Foundation Establishment cultivation. Even if we go all out, our performance will surely not satisfy the Thousand Peaks Forest side."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"At that time, Cave Master Mo Yuan and others will surely think that we are just going through the motions. They may even supervise us on the battlefield and strike us hard to set an example!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"So, this raises a very high demand for us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong's expression was heavy, nodding in agreement: "We have to at least show Nascent Soul-level combat power? That's a bit too difficult!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo corrected: "It's at the Nascent Soul level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"According to our current detection, the center of the stone sphere is the Ten-Thousand-Year Earth Essence, and in the outer circle of the Earth Essence, there is a circle of top-grade Earth-element Spirit Stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"These spirit stones seal most of the spiritual energy of the Old Stone Monster during his lifetime. This foundational condition is very critical."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Don't forget, I have already mastered the complete 'Stone Forged Earth Treasure Divine Ability.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"As long as I transform the stone sphere, if things go smoothly, using the stone sphere as a spiritual energy pool to help me perform the divine ability 'Stone Forged Earth Treasure,' then the people of Thousand Peaks Forest will have nothing to say."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong suddenly realized: "So you are pretending to deceive Liu Er and the others, actually to purchase precious materials to transform the stone sphere into a mechanism?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo said: "I need to tell them about the ambush. After thinking it over, I can only use the pretext of divination. Only in this way can I avoid much suspicion and need not explain the source of this intelligence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Southern Bean Kingdom, near Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Jiufan looked into the distance but did not rush into the city to go home.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He was waiting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After a moment, Lin Bufan, appearing as a mortal, climbed the mountain peak on foot and met with Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Senior Lin, this time I trouble you to come out of seclusion to help. My Ning family will surely give generous rewards!" Ning Jiufan saluted with a face full of joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Lin Bufan slightly waved his hand: "I came a little late because I sought help from a friend to conceal my aura. After all, City Lord Meng Kui is a strategist of the Meng family, proficient in divination. If he calculates my presence through fate, he will surely take precautions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Jiufan understood and said: "Senior Lin, do you mean to hide your identity, lie in wait, and only take action at the last moment?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Lin Bufan nodded: "None of us are proficient in divination. If I show up in advance, I will be calculated by Meng Kui. Only by catching him off guard can we disrupt him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Jiufan sighed deeply and bowed: "Senior Lin, you have helped my Ning family greatly! This kindness is engraved in my heart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">According to the rules of the righteous path, a Nascent Soul-level cultivator like Lin Bufan could not rashly intrude; he should send a flying message in advance to greet the local Nascent Soul-level cultivators before crossing the border.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">After all, as cultivators' cultivation levels increased, their combat power soared. High-level cultivators could easily affect a region by themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This long-term precaution against cultivators had gradually evolved into an unwritten rule of social interaction among Nascent Soul-level cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">But now, Lin Bufan wanted to conceal his identity and "sneak attack" Meng Kui. Naturally, he could not send a flying message. Not greeting in advance and actively helping the Ning family destroy Meng Kui's arrangements was completely a provocation to Meng Kui!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Although Ning Jiufan had obtained Lin Bufan's promise to help, he did not expect Lin Bufan to be so straightforward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Lin Bufan saw Ning Jiufan's face full of gratitude and was secretly pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He had managed the Thousand Medicines Sect for many years and was full of schemes. Since he had already secretly allied himself with the Ning family and the Zhu family, he decided to show the responsibility of an ally!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Although I have managed the Thousand Medicines Sect with great success, it is ultimately just a local sect force."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Now, if I can use the alliance to show my value and strive for the favor of the royal family, the current invisible ceiling of the Thousand Medicines Sect will be lifted. The scale will surely explode and we can control more territories, becoming a local overlord!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"As for offending the Meng family in this trip, it doesn't matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Lin Bufan knew well that having no stance was the most dangerous stance of them all. Since fate and opportunity made him and the Thousand Medicines Sect stand on the side of the Zhu family, then he would try his best to seize the benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Being able to stand at the focal point of the struggle between the Zhu family and the Meng family is already a once-in-a-century opportunity for me and the Thousand Medicines Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Lin Bufan stretched out his hand to help Ning Jiufan up: "I have not left the mountain for a long time. This time I come with the ambition to get the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"This Fire Essence is native to Fire Persimmon Mountain. If the Ning family can control it, your status and strength in the Immortal City will greatly increase."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Coupled with your Elder Ape, you can better contend with Meng Kui!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Therefore, I suggest you don't return home in advance. It's better to stay here and wait for the right time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"During this period, it is enough for Meng Kui to set up his arrangements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"As the City Lord, he will be more anxious about the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"You might as well wait for him to urge you several times. When you have to make a formal move on the Fire Essence, then you return to the city and participate in the battle in time, not violating the agreement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Lin Bufan was a talented person, not just someone who practiced bitterly. His thoughts were agile and quite strategic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Jiufan listened and nodded repeatedly, saying that this made a lot of sense. He immediately obeyed, hiding on this mountain peak, waiting for the opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178"><b>Two Note Country,  Green Forest Immortal City.</b></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">Ning Zhuo entered the city again. After showing his token, he easily met the Grand Craftsman of the Two Note Country, Jin Li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">"Master Jin, I have come this time because I previously sent a message to my family and received a reply. I have more authority to act expediently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">"I want to purchase some precious materials from you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Jin Li welcomed Ning Zhuo's arrival. After hearing his request, he shook his head and smiled: "I am burdened with an important task, forging weapons for many Golden Core cultivators for free."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">"At present, the consumption of precious materials is enormous, and the shortage is increasing. I am about to use them, so how can I sell them to you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Ning Zhuo then said: "Senior Jin, don't worry. Perhaps I didn't make it clear. This is not a transaction, but rather an exchange of what we need."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">As he spoke, he took out the precious materials obtained not long ago from excavating the inner circle of the stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Jin Li saw once again the precious materials of excellent quality, and his eyes immediately lit up. He reached out and, with an invisible force, drew the precious materials from Ning Zhuo's hands into his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Jin Li carefully examined them and praised them repeatedly, then waved his hand to open a secret door: "Here are the precious materials I can spare. Go and choose."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">The precious materials that Ning Zhuo had obtained from chiseling off the remains of the Old Stone Monster were all Earth-element precious materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">The material warehouse on Jin Li's side was naturally very comprehensive, covering the Five Elements as a foundation, and even including Wind, Ice, Heaven and Earth, Magnetic, Celestial, and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Ning Zhuo mainly selected Five Elements materials. After picking and choosing, he came out of the secret room with a pile in his arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">Jin Li saw this and was slightly stunned, then shook his head, indicating that Ning Zhuo could not take so much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and took out more of the Old Stone Monster's precious materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Jin Li was overjoyed, and his pupils slightly shrank, feeling a little shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">"Does your family produce high-quality Earth-element precious materials?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">"Did you find some kind of mine?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">"No, these precious materials are of various kinds and types; how could they be covered by just one or two mines?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Ning Zhuo smiled without speaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Jin Li realized and proactively apologized, saying that he did not intend to pry into others' family secrets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Ning Zhuo shook his head: "This matter is actually not just my Ning family's business. Behind it is the Zhu family. Senior Jin, I can only say this much; please do not casually disclose this matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">"The Southern Bean Kingdom's Zhu family? The royal family!" Jin Li immediately showed a solemn expression, indicating that he would strictly keep this secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Involuntarily, his attitude towards Ning Zhuo became more cautious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Ning Zhuo bought enough Five Elements precious materials, then entered the "Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon," quietly left the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Coming to a remote valley, he stopped the "Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon," dove into the cabin, performed multiple measurements on the stone sphere, and studied the Five Elements materials in his hands, racking his brains on the method of transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">The reason for choosing Five Elements precious materials was naturally because he had a strong advantage in the Five Elements realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Sure enough, after studying for a while, he thoroughly understood the properties of the materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">How would one transform the stone sphere?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Ning Zhuo's initial idea was to imitate the stone sphere into a spherical "Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Of course, Ning Zhuo did not have much understanding of the principles of the void and could not make the stone sphere shuttle through the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">But the Old Stone Monster in his lifetime was extremely good at the Earth Escaping Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">Therefore, Ning Zhuo planned to reproduce the Earth Escaping Technique and add the other Four Elements' escaping techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">In this way, at least by using the Five Elements Escaping Techniques, they could have some ability to run away on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">Ning Zhuo buried his head in contemplation, racking his brains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Sun Lingtong once again entered the "Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat," attached to the stone sphere, to enhance his physical foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">A great battle was imminent; the situation of Sun and Ning was both awkward and dangerous, and the pressure in their hearts far exceeded that of the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">In the Upper Dantian Divine Sea, various thoughts arose and collided fiercely, sometimes generating inspiration or sparks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">Suddenly, a flash of inspiration burst forth like a startling swan, breaking through the sky of the Upper Dantian Divine Sea, causing the huge mirror that served as the sky to crack open a huge fissure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">Ning Zhuo suddenly opened his eyes, extremely excited: "I have thought of it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">"I didn't expect that the 'Five Zang Temple Spiritual Divine Art' would play the most critical role!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">"Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">"If I can implement it successfully, we can not only better play the role of the Old Stone Monster but also enhance my Qi Sea cultivation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">"Boss, boss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">Ning Zhuo eagerly asked Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">"Do you have any techniques that involve cutting flesh to offer as sacrifice? I need them urgently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">Sun Lingtong was stunned for a moment: "Are you talking about 'Blood Demon Disintegration Technique,' 'Bone Sacrifice Skull Throne,' that kind?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly: "Yes, yes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">Sun Lingtong was surprised: "Those are all demonic arts that harm others and oneself, bringing disaster to the world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">Ning Zhuo's expression changed slightly, and he said solemnly: "Boss, don't you trust me? I am a righteous person, with a sense of justice in my heart, loyal and kind; heaven and earth can testify. How could I possibly go astray?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">Sun Lingtong was silent for a moment: "My master warned me when I was young, so I never touch these demonic arts. Because these techniques, when cultivated, will also strongly influence the cultivator's temperament and thoughts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">"Little Zhuo, you should be careful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">"If you really want them, why not go to the 'All-Book Pavilion' to buy them."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
