<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The sky was already bright.<br/>
<br/>
But in a certain courtyard of the Zheng Family, darkness lingered.<br/>
<br/>
Night Star Silk Formation!<br/>
<br/>
Once this formation was set up, it would create a nighttime phenomenon within a certain range.<br/>
<br/>
Even in its restrained state, if fully unleashed, the power of the formation would not be limited to just this courtyard but would encompass a radius of over ten miles.<br/>
<br/>
The night sky above the courtyard fluctuated and gradually transformed into a piece of silk.<br/>
<br/>
From the soft light of the black silk night, four figures flew out, growing larger as they emerged.<br/>
<br/>
All four were Golden Core cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
They were the ancestors of the Zhou Family and the Zheng Family.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, the four Golden Core cultivators had engaged in a gambling match.<br/>
<br/>
Two cultivators from the Zhou Family set up the formation, while two from the Zheng Family broke through it.<br/>
<br/>
The stakes were the Nine Yang Golden Bull Ointment from the Zheng Family and the Southern Sky Vermillion Phoenix Constellation Diagram from the Zhou Family.<br/>
<br/>
The four Golden Core cultivators landed on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The two from the Zheng Family looked proud, with a slight smirk on their faces.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, the two from the Zhou Family remained calm, with a hint of gloom.<br/>
<br/>
Among them, Zhou Nongying still had a trace of incredulity between his eyebrows.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the two from the Zheng Family approaching, Zhou Nongying sighed, "Zheng Brothers, you have won." Zheng Danlian, one of the Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng Family, replied, "It's a shame. Our success in breaking the formation this time was simply due to the advantage of our weapon." This statement immediately reminded the two Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou Family of their previous battle, causing their expressions to change once again.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying sighed again, "I never expected that the nobles had secretly accumulated resources over the years and refined such treasures." "We lost fair and square here."<br/>
<br/>
"We accept our defeat. After we return to our clan, I will personally deliver the Southern Sky Vermillion Phoenix Constellation Diagram to your residence." "Haha, good!" Zheng Shuangjun laughed heartily and took out a bottle of pills, tossing it to Zhou Nongying.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun said, "This is the Nine Yang Golden Bull Ointment! The future of the family lies with the younger generation." "Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen are both talented individuals. It is crucial to treat their illnesses, and the foundation must not be overlooked." The two Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou Family immediately exchanged glances.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying pretended to hesitate and asked, "Is this..."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun clasped his hands, "Hey, we have a request."<br/>
<br/>
"The Zhou Family won with their formation. Friend Zhou Nongying is exceptionally skilled in dynamic formations. In our previous encounter, my clan and I were deeply impressed." "Could you personally set up a dynamic formation for our family's weapon?" "Oh? This...," Zhou Nongying looked hesitant, "Setting up a dynamic formation is something I can do."<br/>
<br/>
"However, in doing so, we would need to refer to the weapon's blueprint." "What's the difficulty in that? Feel free to take a look!" Zheng Shuangjun was quite straightforward.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian added, "Many years ago, we obtained this mechanical blueprint from the Lava Immortal Palace." Despite this, the demeanor of the two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng Family deeply moved the two from the Zhou Family.<br/>
<br/>
In the recent gambling match, the two of them had been defeated by a mechanical weapon.<br/>
<br/>
The weapon had great power and could change its form through mechanical manipulation.<br/>
<br/>
After the transformation, the weapon would exhibit completely different offensive capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
By showing the Zhou Family the mechanical blueprint, the threat posed by this mechanical weapon to the Zhou Family would be greatly reduced.<br/>
<br/>
This was a good thing for the Zhou Family.<br/>
<br/>
The two Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou Family immediately nodded in agreement and inquired about the specific timeframe for setting up the formation.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian said, "The weapon has not been fully completed yet. The final components need to be added, requiring a substantial amount of flame power to melt the key materials." Only after completing the weapon would it be suitable for incorporating the formation.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun added, "Furthermore, in the tempering process, extreme cold power is also required. This is where our family falls short." Zhou Nongying said, "The Ning Family originates from the Northern Wind Country, and their primary cultivation methods are ice-based. They should be able to handle this." Zheng Shuangjun nodded, "That's what we were thinking too."<br/>
<br/>
After the conversation, the patriarch of the Zheng Family knocked on the door and entered, respectfully bowing, "Two seniors, two ancestors, there has been a major event in the city these past few days." He then presented a letter, "This is an invitation from Zhu Xuanji, the Divine Hunter, who wishes to invite Golden Core cultivators from the city to explore the Lava Immortal Palace together." Upon hearing the report from the patriarch of the Zheng Family, the expressions of the four Golden Core cultivators changed.<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Kui! Sitting Mountain Observation, External Peach Fate Core... Hmph, indeed worthy of being our city lord. He uses whatever means necessary without regard for the lives of the city residents." The four Golden Core cultivators, realizing they had been manipulated, were not in a good mood.<br/>
<br/>
"As I said before, Meng Kui is one of the four generals of the Meng Family. For him, bringing the Lava Immortal Palace and even the Fire Persimmon Immortal City under the control of the Meng Family is the best outcome." "He truly lives up to the Nascent Soul stage. With just a slight move, he has changed the entire situation."<br/>
<br/>
"In my opinion, he is more interested in dealing with the Lava Immortal Palace, right? By using the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts, he weakened the Immortal Palace but justified it, making it difficult to accuse him." "After all, authentic sects like the Soul Devouring Sect have emerged." "Is this Cheng Bai the crippled cultivator from the Shadow Demon Cult?" "It's hard to say."<br/>
<br/>
"It's rare to see a true transmission Golden Core cultivator like Cheng Bai being defeated and captured in battle."<br/>
<br/>
"The one who made the move was Sun Lingtong. This person is the master of the black market and has operated in Fire Persimmon City for many years. He himself has the cultivation strength at the Foundation Establishment Peak, and most importantly, he comes from the Void Sect." The Void Sect is a major evil sect that does not yield to the Soul Devouring Sect.<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Lingtong did not show much in this battle. The one who truly defeated Cheng Bai was... a mechanical cultivator named Chuitiao Guest." "Does this mean that many years ago, the Void Sect had already been laying the groundwork in Fire Persimmon City?" Soul Devouring Sect, Void Sect...<br/>
<br/>
The four Golden Core cultivators communicated through voice transmission, their expressions becoming increasingly solemn.<br/>
<br/>
The three sects were powerful figures in the cultivation world, and the Lava Immortal Palace was their legacy and inheritance, attracting forces that were definitely not insignificant.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to these two demonic sects, the Zhou and Zheng families are merely small, localized forces.<br/>
<br/>
"Stormy times ahead," sighed the Golden Core Patriarch.<br/>
<br/>
"The only true reliance we have is on the Southern Bean Kingdom."<br/>
<br/>
"Hehehe, Zhu Xuanji explicitly mentioned Meng Kui's divine abilities in his invitation. This person, being of royal descent, truly understands the art of alliances and stratagems." "Currently, the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain is designated as a forbidden zone by Meng Kui. Among us, two could have entered the Immortal Palace, but Meng Kui directly obstructed them." "His reasons are entirely justified, so we can only comply."<br/>
<br/>
"But this time, Zhu Xuanji's reasons are equally justified‚Äîconcerned for the Lava Immortal Palace, he wishes to lend a helping hand, entering the palace to fend off external enemies!" "Hehehe, how does Meng Zhui feel now? He dealt with us this way, and now Zhu Xuanji deals with him the same way." After a brief discussion, the four Golden Core cultivators immediately decided to accept the invitation.<br/>
<br/>
It had been a long time since the Golden Core cultivators of their two families had entered the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
By leveraging Zhu Xuanji to counter Meng Kui, they could also strengthen their ties with the royal family.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, if things go awry, they might rely on the royal family to back them up against the encroaching tentacles of the Soul Devouring Sect and the Void Sect.<br/>
<br/>
With Xiang Xiao taking action and the clashes between the Void Sect and the Soul Devouring Sect, the four Golden Core cultivators felt the pressure and instinctively united more closely.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, they quickly aligned themselves with the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, in the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng was clearing the path for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The two were unstoppable.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng had advanced to the first stage of the Wisdom Spirit Stage, greatly increasing his combat power, despite the mechanical body of the Golden Blood Battle Ape remaining unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hadn't studied it closely, but along the way, cooperating with the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng, he had gained many insights.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's intelligence was still not on par with a normal person's.<br/>
<br/>
Communicating with Ning Zhuo, he only had a few phrases, truly sparing with words.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo asked for his opinions or deliberately started conversations, Yuan Dasheng remained silent.<br/>
<br/>
"Da Sheng, is it really necessary to always address me as 'Master'? Can't you change the way you address me?" Yuan Dasheng immediately shook his head, firmly refusing, "Master jests. Master is my master; how could I change the address?" This made Ning Zhuo thoughtful.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly understood that previously, when he acted in accordance with his spiritual nature, he had found a position within the underlying cognition of that spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
To Yuan Dasheng, Ning Zhuo had fortunately reached the highest level, being recognized as the master by Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
"If I hadn't reached the highest level, I would have been considered a subordinate or a peer in Yuan Dasheng's spiritual cognition, making it impossible to fully command him." "The spirituality of the Wisdom Spirit Stage has its own set of beliefs. These beliefs guide all their actions." Ning Zhuo once again passed the three gates of the Buddhist Path and received his reward.<br/>
<br/>
There was nothing to say; they were all Illusory True Lotus Seeds.<br/>
<br/>
He received seven in a row before pausing.<br/>
<br/>
The embryonic form of his divine ability originally resembled three segments of lotus root, accompanied by a small sprout and leaf.<br/>
<br/>
After absorbing seven lotus seeds, the sprout fully opened, becoming a lotus leaf the size of an adult's palm.<br/>
<br/>
After making significant progress again, Ning Zhuo retreated all the way, closing the Buddhist Path, arriving at the preparation room, and finally retreating to Room No. 1.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit watched the entire process, its face full of confusion‚Äîwhat exactly was Ning Zhuo trying to do?!<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Ning Zhuo, while fully sensing my Buddha Heart Demon Seal, simultaneously activated the Life Thread.<br/>
<br/>
His soul power was rapidly consumed, and the Life Thread suddenly pulled, drawing Sun Lingtong's soul in.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: !!!<br/>
<br/>
Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: ?!?</div>
