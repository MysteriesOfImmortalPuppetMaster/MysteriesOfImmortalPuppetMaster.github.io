<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"The Five Elements Divine Lord?!" Ning Zhuo quickly extended his divine sense into the stalactite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">However, he didn't discover anything unusual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He couldn't even find a trace of the Five Elements Divine Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Everything seemed as if it had just been an auditory hallucination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">But Ning Zhuo's gaze was focused - at this moment, he had confirmed part of his suspicions: there was definitely something strange about the Ten Thousand Demon Cave!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Brother?" Linghu Jiu noticed Ning Zhuo's unusual expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo looked at Linghu Jiu: "Elder Brother, I just heard the voice of the Five Elements Divine Lord. Previously, he appeared twice - first to teach me divine techniques, then to elevate my Five Elements realm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo didn't hide anything and directly repeated what the Five Elements Divine Lord had just said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Such a thing happened?!" Linghu Jiu was greatly surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The two of them carefully examined the stalactite that had been pointed out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Their divine senses swept back and forth, but they couldn't find anything unusual about this stalactite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Brother, was the Senior Five Elements Divine Lord specifically referring to this stalactite?" Linghu Jiu wanted to confirm again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo frowned: "Indeed, the earlier voice transmission came from this stalactite. But no matter how I examine it, it seems to just be an ordinary stalactite."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Compared to the many surrounding stalactites, this one wasn't special. It was rooted in the cave wall's ceiling, hanging downward, its surface covered in delicate patterns like flowing water waves, emanating an ancient and mysterious aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The stalactite's surface was quite damp, with a water droplet gradually forming at the stone's tip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The droplet gradually grew larger, then separated from the stone column, lightly falling downward. It pierced through the still air, seemingly slow yet fast, striking the ground with a light "drip" sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In that instant, both Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu were stunned, both feeling that this mysterious water droplet was like time incarnate, carrying secrets from tens of thousands of years ago, yet bringing a fresh essence - from its formation to its fall and shattering, a moment containing a thousand years!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu looked at each other, both seeing the amazement in each other's expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo exclaimed softly: "So, the stalactite itself is ordinary - the water droplet is the key!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Linghu Jiu marveled: "Amazing! In the instant the water droplet fell, I sensed the solemn aura of an ancient formation. I've passed through here over a hundred times, never imagining the secret entrance was hidden within a water droplet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"The opportunity to enter exists only during the time the droplet falls."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"What kind of formation is this exactly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo also slightly frowned, indicating he hadn't heard of it before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">But within the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, Sun Lingtong transmitted: "I remember, Master once mentioned to me... this might be the Jade Hourglass Drop Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"This formation contains principles of time and ages, able to greatly slow down the passage of time within the formation, achieving relative life extension. But it must be arranged in a dark environment, requiring little to no light."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Earlier, Little Zhuo, didn't you raise questions about the Five Elements Divine Lord's lifespan? Perhaps this formation is the answer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After discussing briefly, Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu immediately decided to enter the formation together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">As the water droplet fell, both men locked their divine sense onto it and plunged in together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">In their vision, the water droplet grew larger and larger, transforming in an instant from a droplet to the size of a hill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">From the outside, it appeared as if the water droplet released a strange light, enveloping the two men, making their bodies rapidly shrink as they entered the droplet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Drip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The next moment, the water droplet fell onto the rocky surface, splitting into countless tiny liquid fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu disappeared from their original location. Without their spiritual power supporting it, the light quickly dispersed, and the cave once again sank into darkness and stillness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The two men entered the droplet, entering the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This was a world within the formation, filled with luminous mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">After entering, both Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu stood in place, not daring to move carelessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">From within the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, Sun Lingtong let out a surprised exclamation: "There's another formation inside! This is a formation within a formation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"The Jade Hourglass Drop Formation is already very advanced, but it's only the outer formation. Brother, be extremely careful, this inner formation must be even more extraordinary!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Beside him, Linghu Jiu also marveled: "A formation within a formation! Brother Ning Zhuo, I have very little knowledge of formations, being most skilled in swordsmanship and wine tasting. I dare not move randomly, you should examine this formation first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo looked around for a while but found that the luminous mist blocked his vision, making it impossible to see beyond five paces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The mist was pure white, but occasionally large patches of shadow would flash by, disappearing instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Though Ning Zhuo was skilled in mechanical arts and had some knowledge of formations, at this moment he was completely lost, unable to discern the formation's nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"No matter. Big Brother, it's your turn!" Ning Zhuo transmitted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Sun Lingtong laughed playfully: "This kind of exploration is the most interesting, watch me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Saying this, he activated his Spirit Eyes, radiating brilliant spiritual light that penetrated the white mist to see the broader space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sun Lingtong's expertise in formations was even deeper than Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">While Ning Zhuo had deeply studied mechanical arts, formations weren't his main focus. Sun Lingtong, however, had a deeper understanding of formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">On one hand, Sun Lingtong had also studied the mechanical classics left by Meng Yaoyin. On the other hand, Sun Lingtong came from the Void Sect - thieves studied formations as it was essential for making a living.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Finally, Sun Lingtong was older than Ning Zhuo, having had more time to study formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">After seeing many things clearly, Sun Lingtong immediately transmitted to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "Elder Brother Linghu, I've figured it out. Follow me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo reached out and grabbed Linghu Jiu's arm, taking the lead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The white mist suddenly rippled, inverting the five senses and confusing directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">With each step, Ning Zhuo had to adjust for several breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong continued his surveillance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">After the sixth step, a faint cave opening appeared in the white mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong said: "This is the way out. Following this cave opening should allow us to exit the formation space and return to the outside world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Is that so?" Ning Zhuo turned his head, preparing to inform Linghu Jiu of this discovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">But when he turned around, Linghu Jiu had already disappeared!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo's heart skipped a beat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He had thought he was holding onto Linghu Jiu's arm the whole time, but the formation had inverted his senses, causing him to misjudge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"This is bad. Linghu Jiu is lost in this formation, we need to go back and find him," Sun Lingtong said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He acknowledged Linghu Jiu's excellence and character, and since Ning Zhuo held goodwill toward Linghu Jiu, he too appreciated Linghu Jiu by extension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">However, Ning Zhuo's expression was somewhat strange at this moment, and he firmly shook his head: "No! Let's follow this exit path and leave here first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Big Brother, I'm coming in first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo released the Mechanical Dragon and climbed inside to join Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Can the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon traverse space in here?" Ning Zhuo asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong nodded: "I just tried it out, this ability hasn't been sealed, we can still use it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo nodded: "That's good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was at the Nascent Soul level, and though it had no combat capabilities, its escape abilities were extremely strong. Having a Nascent Soul’s ability to traverse space was the source of Ning Zhuo's confidence in exploring this place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Both Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong came to the dragon's head cabin, controlling the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to fly toward the faint cave opening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">As they advanced, the cave opening transformed from illusory to real, and quickly became a dark mountain passage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Ten Thousand Li Dragon concealed itself and followed the mountain path upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">It was clearly perceptible that the mountain path sloped upward diagonally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The mountain path was completely quiet, with no traps or demon beasts blocking the way. The higher they went, the more evident human traces became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Moments later, the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon emerged from the bottom of a dried-up well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon left the well and flew into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun and Ning saw a scene of pavilions, towers, and ornately decorated buildings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">People occasionally moved through the courtyards and corridors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Isn't this Origin Mountain?" Sun Lingtong recognized the place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The next moment, he realized something and sharply inhaled, turning to look at Ning Zhuo: "Little Zhuo!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Did you have suspicions before, which is why you deliberately brought Linghu Jiu to explore the Ten Thousand Demons Cave together?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Even though Ning Zhuo had some mental preparation, a chill still spread through his heart at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He solemnly nodded slowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Origin Mountain wasn’t here originally, it had to have been moved here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"But in the ancient formation, there's an exit leading directly here, which proves someone had already discovered the Jade Hourglass Drop Formation beforehand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"And the biggest suspect in this matter is the Myriad Medicine Sect's leader, Lin Bufan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"His cultivation has reached the Nascent Soul level, and he controls the Ten Thousand Medicines Valley. Secretly making these arrangements wouldn't be difficult for him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong fell silent for a moment, then had another realization: "Many years ago, Lin Bufan strongly advocated moving the entire Myriad Medicine Sect to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley. Could it be that he wasn't just interested in the spirit springs here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"He hasn't fully mastered this opportunity yet. The best proof is you, Little Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"You received the Five Organs Temple Spirit Technique because of the Five Elements Divine Lord's transmission, and got a huge promotion in the Five Elements realm. If Lin Bufan had completely mastered this opportunity, he wouldn't have let an outsider like you benefit so easily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"So, the Profound Thought Fermented Wine really is fake, Hua Guzi was right!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"The real reason is that there's already a great expert's legacy here. That's why, Little Zhuo, you still received the Five Elements Divine Lord's guidance when you sat under the Spirit Concealing Willow, and also heard the Five Elements Divine Lord's voice in the underground cave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"The things buried here should trace back to the Martial Emperor era and are closely related to the Five Elements Divine Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"No, it's not just him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Linghu Jiu once said he had also received quite a bit of guidance. This was actually also due to the opportunity buried underground in the Ten Thousand Demons Cave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Linghu Jiu... does he know about this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered with sharp light: "Most likely not."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"He's also being kept in the dark. Otherwise, given his character and mindset of thinking for the sect's benefit, he wouldn't have actively given me the Netherworld Contemplation Wine, creating such a huge flaw for no reason."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sun Lingtong nodded: "Yes. If he knew, he wouldn't have agreed so readily to explore the demon cave with you just now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"This is bad!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Lin Bufan knows about you now!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Little Zhuo, you didn't hide the fact that you received the Five Elements Divine Lord's legacy before. Linghu Jiu knows, and although he didn't covet the Five Organs Temple Spirit Technique, he would definitely inform his master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Because the Ning family and Myriad Medicine Sect are negotiating about future alliance. This kind of intelligence would increase Lin Bufan's attention toward us. He probably even thinks he secretly helped you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Sun Lingtong was also quite shrewd and quickly deduced more of the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"What's our next move? What are you thinking, Little Zhuo?" Sun Lingtong frowned and expressed his concerns, "Lin Bufan has spent over a hundred years plotting to obtain the opportunity here, making extensive arrangements. But until now, he hasn't gained complete control."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"This shows that the opportunity here is no small matter. And judging from your recent gains, Little Zhuo, it further proves the immense value of this opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Lin Bufan already knows we've touched upon some secrets. Now that we've secretly explored the demon cave, Lin Bufan will definitely discover it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Will he allow us to get involved in this enormous opportunity?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo chuckled: "This is precisely the key to the current situation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Sun Lingtong took a deep breath: "We should immediately notify your family's Golden Core elder. In my opinion, we should have notified them beforehand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo gave a bitter smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Sun Lingtong suddenly had a terrible realization: "I understand now, we absolutely cannot notify Ning Jiufan ahead of time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Because he's already under Lin Bufan's strict surveillance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo nodded: "Exactly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Years ago, when our Ning family migrated, following the underground river out of Ten Thousand Demons Cave to arrive in the valley, we received Lin Bufan's warm welcome."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"He forcibly kept our clan in the valley, hosting us for several months before letting us leave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"During this period, he must have been secretly investigating, checking if anyone in our clan had discovered this opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Only after confirming there wasn't, did he finally let the Ning family leave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"This time, when Ning Jiufan and I came to the Myriad Medicine Sect one after another, in Lin Bufan's mind, he must have had many suspicions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Did the Ning family discover something back then? After establishing themselves in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, did they come back here to explore?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Lin Bufan might guess like this: The Ning family doesn't know that I, Lin Bufan, know about this opportunity, so they want to dig secretly. The Ning family first sent their most talented young descendant to investigate, then sent their Golden Core elder under the pretext of alliance and cooperation, trying to find a legitimate reason to stay long-term and secretly explore the opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Under such suspicion and doubt, if I contact Ning Jiufan, Lin Bufan would likely know instantly. He must be closely monitoring both me and our ancestors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Now, what we need to do can be summed up in one word — wait."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up: "We've already discovered the Jade Hourglass Drop Formation and mysteriously disappeared. Lin Bufan must be anxious. His next actions will reveal his true attitude toward us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Exactly," Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Just as his words fell, in the next moment, the world changed color!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Suddenly, the formation activated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Origin Mountain shook!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The mountain-protecting formation isolated the inside from the outside, forming a huge luminous mist that rapidly expanded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Within a few breaths, the white luminous mist had expanded outward, covering Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, encompassing Origin Mountain, Little Contention Peak, Great Contention Peak, and Medicine Field Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The scene outside attracted Ning Jiufan's attention. He extended his divine sense and asked puzzledly: "Lord Lin, why suddenly activate the mountain-protecting formation? Is there a powerful enemy attacking?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Lin Bufan smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">He first inserted the one thousand eight hundred and seventieth fine needle into the old prisoner's body, making them fall into deep sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Then, he turned to look at Ning Jiufan, his eyes flashing with fierceness: "Friend Ning's acting skills are quite good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Jiufan: ???</paragraph><br/><br/>
