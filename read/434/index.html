<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Quickly, give it a try," Sun Lingtong was also very excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo closed his eyes and silently sensed his new spleen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In a trance, he seemed to enter a temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He sat upright on a platform, becoming the earth god statue worshipped in the temple!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">From outside the temple, a large amount of blood, essence, and qi continuously drifted in. After entering the temple, they were illuminated by the earth god statue and underwent round after round of purification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The purification continued incessantly, absorbing impurities that settled down, enriching the foundational soil beneath the temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The spleen's original function was to digest food, regulate qi and blood, and resist diseases. Now, using Ning Zhuo's own spleen as the foundation to refine the earth-element spleen temple, it has become even more efficient in this aspect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"It can also absorb impurities and precipitate them, just like the earth, accepting everything, bearing everything, nurturing everything. After deep accumulation and the washing of time, it ultimately turns waste into treasure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This immediately reminded Ning Zhuo of the divine ability Stone Casting Earth Treasure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He began to infuse spiritual energy, urging the earth-element spleen temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Instantly, a surging power rose from the depths of his spleen and poured into all directions, actively participating in the life operations of his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo felt as if he was heavily pushed, and an indescribable sense of comfort gradually emerged throughout his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He sat cross-legged and tried to absorb the natural spiritual qi around him. In an instant, a large amount of earth-element spiritual qi was absorbed and poured into the earth-element spleen temple within his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Such an effect of absorbing spiritual qi made Ning Zhuo's heart tremble fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Even though he was the one who improved this spell, he was pleasantly surprised by the actual cultivation effect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"The degree of spiritual qi absorption is far superior to when I use the Tornado Windmill artifact."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"No wonder the Five Elements Divine Lord cultivated all five elements back then, yet his cultivation speed was still so rapid."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo rapidly absorbed most of the earth-element spiritual qi and converted it into the other four elements, maintaining the balance of the five elements within his sea of qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"In the future, if I can possess the complete five elements five-organs divine temples, my cultivation speed will definitely make a huge leap."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"The Five Organs Temple Divine Technique I currently designed requires the essence of the five elements, and it's best if they have spirituality."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Without spirituality, Ning Zhuo couldn't create external gods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He performed blood sacrifice on his organs, mostly using his own spirituality to create the temple and control the external god.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He had just refined it, and he was almost the god statue himself, with the deepest level of control. But in the future, if his own spirituality couldn't be replenished constantly, the spirituality originating from the stone old monster would inevitably rise, and even gradually take the lead, eventually controlling the earth-element spleen temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This was the drawback of the Five Organs Temple Divine Technique! "So, the earth-element spleen temple cannot leave the body for too long; it must often return to replenish spirituality and suppress the external god."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo silently reminded himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Next is the key!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo moved his mind, and immediately his own spleen shook, broke free from its original position, and turned into a mass of earthy yellow light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo opened his mouth and spat out the light mass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">While controlling the light mass to drill into the stone sphere, he activated the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, allowing the missing part of the spleen to form a piece of blood tendon as a temporary replacement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The light mass followed the fine hole previously drilled in the stone sphere, all the way deep into the stone core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">There, the light mass expanded, filling the hollow of the stone core, vaguely forming an earth-element temple. The temple doors were wide open, and inside sat a god statue, whose appearance resembled Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo's connection with his own earth-element spleen temple was extremely close. He immediately manipulated the earth-element spleen temple to quickly permeate the stone sphere itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">After a moment, it was as if he had grown another organ.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He mobilized the earth-element spiritual energy within the top-grade spiritual crystals inside the stone sphere. The spiritual energy spurted out, causing the stone sphere to flip and roll everywhere, extremely agile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">With a thought, Ning Zhuo caused the earth-element spleen temple to burst out with strong suction, immediately reabsorbing the earth-element mana that had been sprayed out, storing it back into the spiritual stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun Lingtong had been watching all along. Seeing this scene, he clapped vigorously: "Little Zhuo, you succeeded!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo also showed a bright smile: "Elder Brother, with the earth-element spleen temple, I can control the stone sphere itself as if it were my own arm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"But I still need to modify the interior into becoming a mechanism, so I can use it better!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The core layer of the stone sphere was a large number of top-grade earth-element crystals, containing surging Nascent Soul-level spiritual energy; it was a natural spiritual energy pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo also planned to create multiple stone mirrors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The stone mirrors originated from the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Art, providing an alternative amplification for divine sense. Combined with the stone sphere, they complemented each other perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Time was very tight. Ning Zhuo worked tirelessly for two days and nights before achieving his expected goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His face was pale, with two quite obvious dark circles under his eyes, as he returned to the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">While training new recruits, the three generals were also very concerned about Ning Zhuo. After all, Ning Zhuo had taken a considerable amount of military funds and had disappeared without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Learning that Ning Zhuo had returned, Liu Er laughed heartily and personally went out of the camp to greet him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">When he saw Ning Zhuo, he was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Previously, Ning Zhuo was dressed in white, with bright eyes and fair skin, his divine light shining brightly. Now, the young man was haggard, with a pale complexion, swollen eyes, and heavy dark circles, as if most of his yang energy had been sucked out by a female ghost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Liu Er took a deep breath and reached out to hold Ning Zhuo's arms: "Military Advisor has done too much for our army, to the point of such exhaustion!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Come into the camp and rest for a few days, take good care, and don't work so hard anymore."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He only cared about Ning Zhuo and didn't even mention the divination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Such social skills, regardless of sincerity, made Ning Zhuo feel warm at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head and transmitted to Liu Er: "Reporting to the Great General, I have fortunately not disgraced my mission this time. The divination was successful, and I have calculated a prophetic poem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"The content of the poem is shocking, so I dared not rest for a moment and rushed back to inform the General."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"This prophetic poem is:"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111"><div style=" padding: 8px; font-style: italic;">"Horse hooves trample falling flowers,"<br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Wind rises, shadows sink in the sand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Who can keep the bright moon,"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Who will bury the rosy clouds?"</paragraph></div></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Liu Er listened and immediately frowned. After pondering for a moment, he looked at Ning Zhuo and transmitted his divine sense: "Military Advisor, how do you interpret this poem?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo shook his head with a bitter smile: "I cannot fully interpret it either. Just looking at this poem makes me feel that the future is full of crises."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"The so-called 'horse hooves trample falling flowers' seems to imply that our army is about to set out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"The word 'falling flowers' makes me feel terrified. As the saying goes, 'falling flowers and flowing water', I fear that the army's advance will be fraught with difficulties."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">But Liu Er shook his head: "'Horse hooves trample falling flowers' according to my understanding, can't it mean that our army sets out and tramples the enemy along the way, defeating them utterly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned: "This prophetic poem cannot be interpreted line by line, Great General."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Because the next line, 'Wind rises, shadows sink in the sand,' indicates that the situation will take a sharp turn, the enemy will rise like the wind, and the situation will become hazy and dangerous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"'Who can keep the bright moon' the bright moon represents hope."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"'Who will bury the rosy clouds' the rosy clouds represent the smoke of war."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"These two lines indicate that someone will perish in the upcoming crisis, while someone survives to the next night, seeing the hope of survival. This means that our army has not been completely annihilated and still has a light of hope."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Liu Er listened carefully and shook his head again: "Military Advisor, you are being too pessimistic."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"The way i see it, the last two lines clearly say that both sides will have casualties on the battlefield; some people survive, and some die."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"We need to be cautious of enemies who are adept at using smoke and rosy cloud techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"But in my opinion, our Fire Cloud Camp can stir up fire clouds to cover the battlefield, isn't that 'rosy clouds'?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Hahaha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo was speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">When he came, he was indeed a bit hasty and had only composed this prophetic poem halfway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">As a result, when he tried to persuade Liu Er, the latter was unexpectedly optimistic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath: "Great General, I personally performed the divination and experienced it myself, and I have my own feelings and insights."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"My emotions are quite low, and this is the biggest revelation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"General must not be complacent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Liu Er nodded repeatedly and continued to comfort Ning Zhuo, accompanying him all the way back to the military advisor's tent to rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Zhang Hei and Guan Hong, upon learning that Ning Zhuo had returned to camp, took advantage of a break in training to find him together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Halfway, the three met.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Liu Er waved his hand: "This divination has exhausted the Military Advisor terribly. Go back and don't disturb his rest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Zhang Hei laughed: "Heh, I knew the Military Advisor was reliable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">As he spoke, he glanced at Guan Hong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Guan Hong stroked his beard: "I just said that anything is possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He then asked Liu Er about the result of the divination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Liu Er recited the prophetic poem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Zhang Hei was dumbfounded, while Guan Hong pondered: "Military Advisor and Eldest Brother's interpretations both make sense. Prophetic poems have this ambiguous nature."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">As they were talking, a messenger in the army, carrying a military order and riding a fast horse, came into the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Seeing the three Golden Core generals, the messenger still sat on his horse without any salute, merely raising the military order: "I order the Three Generals Camp to prepare immediately and set out with the main army tomorrow morning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei all widened their eyes simultaneously. Zhang Hei even took a light breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Such a strange reaction instead startled the messenger. "Why aren't you accepting the order? Do you intend to disobey?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Liu Er hurriedly took the military order token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">As soon as the messenger left, Zhang Hei couldn't hold back: "Eldest Brother, Second Brother, the Military Advisor truly lives up to his title; he indeed has some real skills."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"He actually predicted that our army would set out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Does this... mean that our future is bleak?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Guan Hong pondered silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Liu Er took a deep breath, his face solemn: "Second Brother, Third Brother, in fact, I believe the Military Advisor more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"After all, the Military Advisor is adept at divination; I'm completely an outsider."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Then why did I comfort the Military Advisor like that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">At this point, Liu Er said seriously: "Two virtuous brothers, if the future is full of crises and there is life-and-death danger, will we retreat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"I won't!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Liu Er took a deep breath, his eyes reddening: "Although I am a blood descendant of the Lu royal family, so what?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Who will look up to me because of this identity?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"More people disparage me as a hybrid of humans and demons!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"I want to make a name for myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"I really want to!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"But in today's cultivation world, it's hard for a cultivator of my background to be recognized."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"I must seize this opportunity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"For me, the Two Note Nation's expedition against Thousand Peaks Forest is an opportunity that I must grasp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Therefore, no matter how dangerous it is, I must go on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Liu Er's words were sincere and forceful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Zhang Hei was moved and immediately said: "Eldest Brother, I understand you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"I brought some of my clansmen to move to Green Forest Immortal City, wanting to develop and grow using the resources near Thousand Peaks Forest. But after moving there, I found that the important positions were already occupied."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Although Green Forest Immortal City is big, the space left for outsiders to develop is too little, too little!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Only by participating in the conquest can I make meritorious achievements, avoid being excluded, and truly gain growth and development."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"So Eldest Brother, rest assured, I, Old Hei, will definitely charge at the forefront on the battlefield!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Guan Hong also said: "I have traveled the world and seen this prosperous age like oil boiling over a raging fire, with countless cultivators like locusts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"I believe that a great era of contention is coming!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"As real men, we should follow the trend and ride the waves at the forefront of the times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Eldest Brother, Third Brother, Guan will never flee without a fight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Seeing the two express their intentions, Liu Er was overjoyed. He grabbed their arms with both hands: "Good! Worthy of being my sworn brothers, Liu Er's brothers. From now on, we three will advance and retreat together, watch and help each other, and we will surely make a career in this world!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Eldest Brother! Second Brother, Third Brother!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Eldest Brother! Second Brother, Third Brother!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The three generals shared the same heart and will, and their friendship deepened further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The three generals began to dispatch soldiers, making various preparations for setting out early the next morning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Heavy fog.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Thick fog shrouded the mountains and rivers; grasses and trees were all swallowed by the white mist. The distant peaks loomed indistinctly, the outlines of the mountaintops blurred, seemingly ready to be completely devoured by the fog at any time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The roadside grasses and trees drooped, wet dewdrops hanging on branches and leaves, gently swaying like silent whispers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">In the mist, even the sunlight of the rising sun appeared pale and powerless, as if everything had fallen into endless silence, vast and confused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">As the commander of the Golden Halberd Army, an important general of Two Note Nation, Sun Gan was responsible for this march.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">A messenger came to report: "Sir, General Liu Er of the Three Generals Camp sent someone to inquire whether we should suspend the march today due to the heavy fog."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Sun Gan sat upright in the command seat. Hearing this, he was stunned, then sneered: "A mere fog, how can it hinder the march? Ridiculous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">After a while, Sun Gan ordered someone to ask: "As the vanguard, why hasn't the Three Generals Camp moved yet?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Immediately, someone reported that the Three Generals Camp hadn't even finished dismantling their tents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Sun Gan snorted coldly, extremely dissatisfied: "A bunch of useless people!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The deputy general beside him said disdainfully: "The Three Generals Camp is a motley crew in the first place. The commander of the Barbarian Demon Camp, Xu Dali, at least is a man of the military, specializing in military tactics. But what are Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei? They dabble in some military tactics and think they can lead troops into battle. Simply ridiculous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Sun Gan: "Pass down the order: The Three Generals Camp is too slow in marching, violating military orders. Punish their main general Liu Er with thirty strikes of the large board. Record it first, and execute the military law when we reach Wooden Wheel Town."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Order the Barbarian Demon Camp to take the lead as the vanguard!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"The White Jade Camp will follow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"My Golden Halberd Army will be in the center."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"Behind our army is the Red Flower Camp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"The Three Generals Camp will bring up the rear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"The whole army sets out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Sun Gan's punishment and questioning were immediately passed to the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Ning Zhuo said guiltily: "According to my plan, I have implicated the Great General to be punished with thirty strikes. It's my fault."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">But Liu Er immediately waved his hand: "A mere thirty strikes; I can bear it, it's no big deal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"The Military Advisor is thinking for our Three Generals Camp; we all understand in our hearts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">"Let's not talk about it. Pass down the order: Let the whole army pack up properly, remain vigilant throughout the journey, do not slack off. Those who violate will be severely punished with sixty strikes of the large board!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
