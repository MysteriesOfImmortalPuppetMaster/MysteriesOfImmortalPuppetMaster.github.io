<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo immediately recognized Ning Xiaohui’s voice. Leaving the dining table, he stepped into the courtyard to see his former classmate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Xiaohui and Ning Zhuo were students in the same year at the academy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Back then, Ning Zhuo’s grades had been above average but still unremarkable. As for Ning Xiaohui, she was a member of the main family and possessed the innate talent of Ice Jade Hands, and was always the top scorer. She was somebody that everyone admired, like the bright moon surrounded by twinkling stars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">At this moment, Ning Xiaohui’s face wore an indifferent expression. Her gaze was cold as she looked Ning Zhuo up and down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Deep down, she was slightly surprised. This unremarkable former classmate of hers actually didn’t look all that bad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">She examined him from head to toe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“How unexpected. You were actually the real inventor of the explosive fire monkey.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo chuckled awkwardly and said, “Well… it was really just a stroke of luck. If I had to create another mechanical construct of a similar level, I don’t think I could do it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Indeed.” Ning Xiaohui had seen all of Ning Zhuo’s information, including the numerous drawings and prototypes that the investigation team had discovered in the underground workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">From those, she had learned that the explosive fire monkey had only been completed five or six years after Ning Zhuo initially began work on the concept.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This discovery significantly lowered her evaluation of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo stepped closer to Ning Xiaohui. “May I ask why you called me out here?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Xiaohui frowned slightly, feeling he was too close. She took a small step backward and said, “You actually offered the explosive fire monkey to outsiders. Why didn’t you report it to the clan first?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo sighed and spread both hands, looking frustrated and innocent. “I really did want to tell the clan. But at the time, the mechanical monkey still had flaws. It wasn’t complete!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“I couldn’t present it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“I went to consult Chen Cha and managed to solve the design issues. But I didn’t expect that it would end up being exposed and even catching the eye of an important person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“What could I do?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Fortunately, they at least paid me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Hmph, you’re talking about Sir Fei Si, aren’t you?” Ning Xiaohui deliberately dropped the name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo’s expression instantly shifted in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Seeing that she had achieved her goal, Ning Xiaohui’s lips curved into a cold sneer. “Ning Zhuo, all you care about is money. You’re truly short-sighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Don’t you know the phrase ‘fame before fortune’? With fame comes fortune.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Fame is far more important than some measly profits!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Inventing the explosive fire monkey was a great achievement, but now it’s been taken from you. How could money compensate such a loss?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Is that so?” Ning Zhuo scratched his head. He had a naive and simpleminded expression on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Seeing Ning Zhuo looking so foolish, Ning Xiaohui felt a surge of disgust. She lost any desire to continue the conversation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Little did she know, Ning Zhuo had already seen through her arrogance and disdain, and had smoothly steered things the entire time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Xiaohui turned and began walking away. “I came to tell you that there’s a small banquet tonight. I’ll bring you with me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Make yourself presentable. Don’t embarrass the clan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo asked in surprise, “May I ask what kind of banquet it is? Who will be attending?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Xiaohui continued walking without looking back. “People from the joint recultivation team. Zheng Jian, Zhou Zeshen, and Zhou Zhu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Dragons don’t mingle with snakes. Just follow my lead and don’t speak too much.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Oh, okay.” Ning Zhuo quickly responded. “Oh wait, I should report to Sir Junior Patriarch first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“As you wish.” Ning Xiaohui exited the courtyard and disappeared beyond the doorway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo’s gaze turned deep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Saying he needed to report to the junior patriarch was merely empty words. Truthfully, he already knew that Ning Xiaohui could have only reached the inner residence if she already had Ning Xiaoren’s approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Ning Xiaohui is from the main family, and I’m just from the branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“My cultivation base and mechanical arts skills already pose a certain level of threat to Ning Xiaohui.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Had this been in the past, Ning Zhuo would have long been given a warning or even designated as a target for suppression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">But now that the three clans were joining forces, things had to be fairer. The Ning Clan’s disadvantageous position meant that it needed Ning Zhuo to support Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">That was why he was being treated with courtesy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“But Ning Xiaohui isn’t someone who tolerates others. If I keep showing off my talent, she’ll become an obstacle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Only by removing this obstacle will I be able to keep moving forward.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo always thought several steps ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">As the saying went, failure to consider the long-term led to immediate worries. And right now, Ning Zhuo was already considering how he could remove Ning Xiaohui from his path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">After thinking for a while, he shook his head with a bitter smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He couldn’t come up with a good solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Soon, Ning Zhuo went to report to Ning Xiaoren, informing him about the banquet that evening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Xiaoren was quite pleased by Ning Zhuo’s show of obedience, feeling that his testing of the young man’s nature had revealed a compliant soul. He immediately voiced his approval. Saying that Ning Zhuo’s current attire was unsuitable for a banquet, he ordered someone to tailor a new outfit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">With the resources and servants that came with the status of junior patriarch, and as part of the world of cultivation, producing some simple formal clothing was extremely efficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Everything was ready by the time evening arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">And it wasn’t just one set; there were three outfits in total.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Xiaoren didn’t waste the opportunity to show some goodwill. He was there throughout the entire fitting process, constantly offering words of praise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In the end, his eyes reddened slightly, and he choked up a bit. “If only Brother Ning Zhong were still alive to see his son growing up into such a fine young man… He would have been so proud.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo quickly asked about his father.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">However, Ning Xiaoren actually didn’t know a thing. He coughed and excused himself, saying that it was getting late and that the uncle-nephew chat could wait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">In his mind, he was already planning to investigate everything about Ning Zhong, looking for ways to fabricate a deep bond between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Oh, right.” Ning Xiaoren took out a money pouch and handed it to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“I know you already have a vast fortune, but take this as pocket money. Think of it as a little gift from your Uncle Ning.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Xiaoren handed it over rather slowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up. He quickly reached out with both hands and took the pouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">His swift, smooth motion made even Ning Xiaoren pause in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Many thanks, Uncle Ning!" Ning Zhuo's thanks this time was more direct than ever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Then, the young man added, "Uncle Ning, what vast fortune do I have? I’ve never felt that my money was all that much. In fact, it’s hardly enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Besides, who would ever complain about having too much money?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Thank you, Uncle Ning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo thanked him once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Xiaoren let out a dry cough. "Good, good. I’m glad you're willing to accept it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Watching Ning Zhuo inspect the money pouch, his feelings were a bit mixed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo’s attitude toward money practically echoed Ning Xiaoren’s own views.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">A kindred spirit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But this kind of kindred spirit… Well, he would be better off without one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Especially since it was Ning Xiaoren’s own money that Ning Zhuo was holding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">However, thinking about it again, it all made perfect sense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Xiaoren recalled all the intelligence he’d seen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo had been raised under someone else's roof as a child, mistreated by Ning Ze and Wang Lan, and barely had any spending money. His life had been quite frugal. In contrast, Ning Ji lived in luxury, always well-clothed and well-fed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo was always short on funds, and after entering the academy, he often did odd jobs to earn money.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">With that kind of upbringing, Ning Zhuo's craving for money must have grown strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">So it wasn’t the least bit surprising that Ning Zhuo agreed to let Chen Cha take the credit for creating the explosive fire monkey in exchange for a large sum of spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">After parting with Ning Zhuo, Ning Xiaoren felt quite satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Because he had discovered that Ning Zhuo wasn’t hard to win over at all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Winning someone over was simple. You just had to cater to their interests!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Ning Zhuo's first interest is mechanical arts. The second is money.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Hmph, it’s better to draw him in using mechanical arts texts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">As for money, Ning Xiaoren liked it very much himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Night fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">When the carriage came to a halt, Ning Zhuo was the first to hop off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Next, Ning Xiaohui lowered herself slowly, using the back of a servant as a step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Ning Zhuo, your status is different now. You must be mindful of your every move." Ning Xiaohui frowned. "Jumping casually off the carriage like that is too frivolous. It's not how the son of a prestigious clan should behave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Oh. Right, understood." Ning Zhuo quickly nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Along the way, he kept looking around. He was clearly unfamiliar with this place, and everything seemed fresh and new to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Xiaohui frowned even deeper. "Stay close."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo hurried to follow her order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Then Ning Xiaohui added, "Not that close. Keep your distance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo: "Oh, right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“Welcome! Both of you, welcome!” Zheng Jian stood at the entrance to the private room and greeted them personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He was the one to arrange this little banquet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">As Ning Xiaohui and Ning Zhuo entered, they saw that Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu had already arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Everyone greeted each other with smiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">This experience alone made Ning Zhuo feel a little out of place. He had never seen these prodigies smiling and chatting so pleasantly before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The food at the banquet was, of course, exquisite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed as he stared at the table. His chopsticks moved more than anyone else’s.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Zheng Jian and the others watched him closely. When it came to Ning Xioahui, they could be said to understand her fairly well, but the suddenly-risen Ning Zhuo was an unknown factor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Of course, their respective clans had done their utmost to investigate, and the gathered intelligence was no less detailed than what the Ning Clan itself had discovered. But some things still required face-to-face probing and observation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Seeing how Ning Zhuo tried to act calm, yet couldn’t help but eat and drink constantly, they gradually formed a picture in their minds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Combined with the intel they had on him, their impression of Ning Zhuo quickly formed: a bottom-tier clan member who had shown some talent and entered the upper echelon through a fortuitous opportunity. Formerly a marginal figure, he was now trying his best to fit in, yet his every move was clumsy and out of place. Each wonder-filled glance at the surroundings exposed his lowly past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">During the meal, Zheng Jian and the others naturally brought up the topic of Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Zheng Jian first toasted Ning Xiaohui. “We really have to thank your Ning Clan for the talismans that prevent our souls from being drawn into the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“Now that the three clans have allied together and everyone here is at the peak of the third level of Qi Refining, we can finally take off our talismans and explore the palace together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“I believe that with our strength combined, we will surely overcome the challenges ahead of us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo, who had been listening intently, immediately perked up. His voice was excited and his face glowed with enthusiasm as he said, “That’s right! Now that we’ve joined forces, we’ll break through the obstacles in the blink of an eye and charge forward triumphantly!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Zheng Jian: …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Zhou Zhu: …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">An awkward silence fell over the little banquet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
