<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Underground Secret Base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A massive blood transformation pool, resembling a coffin, hung from the ceiling beam of the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A thick golden curved pipe extended from the blood transformation pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The pipe connected to a gigantic blood oil bottle, filled with turbid essence blood, appearing black and red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">From the bottom of the blood oil bottle, five or six pipes extended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">These pipes were ultimately inserted into the back of a mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Inside the mechanical ape, Yuan Dasheng's spirit was fully exerting the ninth layer of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Essence blood was continuously infused from the blood oil bottle into Yuan Dasheng's mechanical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Then, under the operation of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, it transformed into demonic essence blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged opposite Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Between him and Yuan Dasheng, as well as around them, was a simple and somewhat hasty formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The formation emitted a faint red light and a slight bloody smell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The ninth layer of demonic essence blood cultivated by Yuan Dasheng was purified through this formation and finally entered Ning Zhuo's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo then used the seventh layer of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to continuously convert it, removing the essence blood that did not conform to his own, and continuously accumulating his Qi Sea cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Often, out of ten portions of demonic essence blood, only two to three portions could be used by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But by doing so, Ning Zhuo did not need to cultivate himself, saving him a lot of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Moreover, as long as the scale was large enough, theoretically, his Qi Sea cultivation speed would be extremely exaggerated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Having clan members is really good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"How can I expand the number of clan members so that I can obtain more blood and flesh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo had been pondering this question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">After tasting the enormous benefits, he found it hard to extricate himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">But he did not lose his reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He was very clear: his large-scale public acquisition of clan members' blood and flesh had already entered a rather gray area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Just one more step forward, and he would be suspected of cultivating demonic arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He had been too high-profile recently, violating his principle of always hiding his strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Now, many people were watching him, waiting for him to make a mistake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Previously, his large-scale procurement of clan members' blood and flesh was like retrieving chestnuts from the fire, extremely risky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Although he did it under the pretext of "developing puppet mechanisms," to show the public.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Houjun and Ning Youfu, the former elders of two branches, had sent people or letters to remind Ning Zhuo to be extremely cautious about his reputation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The scale could not be expanded any further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">If it expanded further, it would be very easy to be accused and have his reputation ruined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">And reputation was extremely important for righteous cultivators!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Suddenly, the left arm of the mechanical ape made a muffled sound and then broke off at the elbow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Then, as if triggering a chain reaction, the shoulder, chest, and abdomen of the mechanical ape all burst out with mechanical fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">A large amount of essence blood spurted out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">In the torrent of blood, the mechanical ape could not bear the burden and shattered into pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo frowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He was neither surprised nor distressed, after all, the mechanical ape was typically crudely made.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">However, this was already the one hundred and thirty-second one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The broken remains had already piled up into a small hill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo looked up at the ceiling beam.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The giant blood transformation pool and blood oil bottle hanging there also showed fine lines, with signs of disintegration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"It's time to properly create a mechanical ape," Ning Zhuo thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Previously, he and Sun Lingtong had been crudely making them, mainly to quickly break through to the seventh layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">After reaching the seventh layer, Ning Zhuo's cultivation of the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit broke through the bottleneck and could continue to rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Now that Ning Zhuo had reached the seventh layer of cultivation, he needed to focus on the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">On one hand, he needed a Golden Core Stage mechanical ape to fully utilize Yuan Dasheng's spirit, and on the other hand, he needed a mechanical ape that could produce higher quality essence blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Combining the two, Ning Zhuo decided to immediately start refining a new mechanical body for Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He took the initiative to invite Zheng Jian to jointly refine the mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zheng Jian was very surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Last time, he had learned a lot of mechanical knowledge from Ning Zhuo and was quite impressed with Ning Zhuo's mechanical skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"I wonder what ingenious ideas Brother Ning has this time?" Zheng Jian asked Ning Zhuo for guidance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo shook his head: "I might disappoint you, Brother Zheng. This time, my refining of the mechanism is different from last time..." After explaining, Zheng Jian indeed showed a disappointed expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">It turned out that Ning Zhuo did not intend to disclose the mechanical design, but needed high-quality materials refined with the help of the Zheng family and Zheng Jian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zheng Jian hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded, thinking that with his friendship with Ning Zhuo, he could help refine the materials once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo took out the Scarlet Sun Copper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zheng Jian was astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"This kind of Golden Core Stage copper material requires extremely high firepower to melt. No wonder Brother Ning came to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"But I am only at the Qi Refining Stage. Brother Ning, you might be overestimating me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo indicated that other cultivators from the Zheng family could be invited to do the work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zheng Jian then nodded: "As long as Brother Ning can afford the price, with our friendship, I will surely help you invite the experts from the clan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"The price is negotiable." Ning Zhuo appeared very straightforward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The expert from the Zheng family invited by Zheng Jian quoted a high price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo smiled and bargained: "What if I need not only the Scarlet Sun Copper refined?" He took out the second material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">As a result, the expert from the Zheng family frowned after looking at it: "This Ten Thousand Mechanisms Black Iron requires painstaking effort, at least ten thousand strikes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Although it is a Golden Core Stage material, it consumes too much labor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I don't have much time to take private jobs. There are many important tasks in the clan pressing on my shoulders."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo took out the third material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This time, the expert from the Zheng family directly shook his head, indicating it was impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Unless it's the Golden Core Stage, it can be directly refined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"I am only at the Foundation Establishment Stage and need to borrow the Heaven-character refining room to have a chance to melt it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"But currently, the Heaven-character refining room is occupied."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo then asked how long it would take for the room to be available.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"That is uncertain. I advise you not to have too much expectation." The expert from the Zheng family was very honest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">After leaving the Zheng family, Ning Zhuo soon contacted Zhou Zeshen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Zhou Zeshen praised: "Brother Ning is truly ambitious, daring to touch Golden Core Stage mechanical constructs at the Qi Refining Stage. Such a grand gesture! Remarkable, remarkable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"I am willing to fully support you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">As a result, when Ning Zhuo mentioned the specific requirements, Zhou Zeshen expressed considerable difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Brother Ning, you want to set up formations on these Golden Core Stage materials, and such a large, dense formation at that. I, Zhou Zeshen, cannot do it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"The Foundation Establishment cultivators in my family can barely manage, but it requires a lot of manpower working together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Otherwise, the construction period will be very long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">After calculating, Ning Zhuo found that the remuneration from the Zhou family was very high, and with more people, the cost made Ning Zhuo feel quite strained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">However, when Ning Zhuo summoned the former stewards under his command and assigned them the task of making talismans, he received good feedback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">These elite Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Ning family all expressed their willingness to refine various martial arts talismans for Ning Zhuo for free.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">However, how could Ning Zhuo agree?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Saving spirit stones was not important.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo did not want to take the lead in breaking his own rules and the hard-earned team atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Paying his subordinates was far more valuable than paying the Zheng family or Zhou family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After comprehensive calculations, Ning Zhuo found that if he paid spirit stones, he could barely reach one-third of the project volume.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">This was not because the Zhou family or Zheng family deliberately raised prices; in fact, their prices were already quite fair compared to the market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Materials reaching the Golden Core Stage made Ning Zhuo's accumulated funds seem very shallow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">His idea of jointly refining mechanisms with various forces was good, but when implemented in reality, many difficulties arose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">After thinking for a while, Ning Zhuo came up with a solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"It's time to expose some information about Meng Chong!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo secretly leaked the information about Meng Chong's achievements and the acquisition of the fourth to sixth layers of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique to the three major families through the Turtle Breath Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Zhou Zeshen exclaimed: "Meng Chong is indeed formidable! The City Lord's Mansion is far ahead!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zheng Jian clenched his fists: "I must obtain the subsequent techniques. Being stuck at the third layer is really unbearable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Ning family patriarch and elders discussed: "The Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique left by the three sect masters has great potential. The subsequent techniques are a major matter for our clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The elders discussed: "Who can take on this important task?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Ning Xiaohui has already left the reformation team."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">After a brief discussion, the elders' minds all turned to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">For the Ning family to obtain the subsequent techniques, it seemed, perhaps, they could only rely on Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The elders continued to discuss: "Although personally very averse, I have to admit that Ning Zhuo is capable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"The key is, with Ning Zhuo's character, even if he obtains the subsequent techniques, will he hand them over to the clan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">At this point, the elders looked at each other and fell into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">After a long time, someone broke the silence and looked at the Ning family patriarch: "Ning Zhuo loves money. Please, patriarch, communicate with him more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Ning family patriarch nodded with a grim expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Just thinking about Ning Zhuo gave him a headache.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">There were two routes to explore the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Entering the palace physically could earn merit points to exchange for various cultivation resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Entering the palace spiritually required passing numerous tests but could obtain the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">And this was a reward that those who entered the palace physically could not obtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In the arrangement of the three sect masters, entering the palace physically was for outsiders and guest cultivators, while entering the palace spiritually was for cultivating their own people, and the true transmission secrets would not be made public.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">For the three families, they had deeply studied the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Even with only three layers, they found this technique extremely excellent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Their desire for the subsequent techniques had always been there, silently accumulating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">And this desire was precisely what Ning Zhuo discovered and manipulated as "puppet strings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Without Ning Zhuo seeking them out, Zhou Zeshen and Zheng Jian took the initiative to find him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">They did not know how many tests needed to be passed to obtain the technique rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">But they knew that Ning Zhuo was very strong and had great conflicts with the main branch of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">If they could invite Ning Zhuo to assist, it would be very beneficial for their exploration of the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Strengthening their relationship with Ning Zhuo and supporting him would be advantageous for the potential second internal conflict within the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">This multi-benefit approach made the Zhou and Zheng families, who harbored ulterior motives, enthusiastic and willing to offer discounts to Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The problem troubling Ning Zhuo was thus resolved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The main branch of the Ning family was furious upon learning of Ning Zhuo's cooperation with the Zhou and Zheng families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Many wanted to take this opportunity to accuse him of colluding with outsiders and disregarding the clan's interests, thereby ruining Ning Zhuo's reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">But they were persuaded to stop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The Ning family patriarch, pinching his nose, once again summoned Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo gladly went.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">After returning, the sound of things being smashed was heard again from the Ning family patriarch's study.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
