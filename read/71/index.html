<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“Yuan Er pays respects to Mister Ning!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Seeing Yuan Er bow down to him, Ning Zhuo hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He wondered whether this was a chance to truly subdue the Monkey Head Gang and bend it to his own will. Yuan Dasheng was now a cripple, but its soul could still enter the immortal palace. It would be a fantastic weapon in the battle over the palace’s inheritance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">But immediately after thinking this, Ning Zhuo calmed himself down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“I can’t be greedy for illusory gains!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Although Yuan Er is bowing down to me, it’s only because I have a hold on his weakness. In the final analysis, I myself am not the one who subdued him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“If Fei Si recruits him in the future, or if he catches the attention of the three great clans, will Yuan Er still remain loyal to me? That’s absolutely impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“More critically, even if Yuan Er was completely loyal to me, could I really use him to control the Monkey Head Gang?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo shook his head inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Many gang members were already disappointed in Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Could I use Yuan Er to control Yuan Dasheng?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo once again shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Yuan Dasheng protected Yuan Er, but it rarely took orders from him. It had climbed up from the bottom, and had its own ambitions and judgment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo’s strike had caught it off guard, which was why it suffered a setback. But once it had some time to gather intel, its years of battle-hardened experience and accumulated wisdom would let it clearly recognize its current predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Once that happened, it would most likely take the initiative to join one of the four major forces, causing them to cast Ning Zhuo to the side and maybe even eliminate him directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“I’m too weak right now. It’s like I’m walking along the edge of a cliff, or balancing on a vertical tower of eggs. I can’t afford to lose my head over this kind of temptation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“One wrong step, and I’ll plunge into the abyss and perish!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">At this point, Ning Zhuo was completely calm and no longer had any thoughts about untouchable benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He reached out with both hands and helped Yuan Er up, saying with praise, “A true hero is one who can recognize the times…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">For the next while, Ning Zhuo continuously spouted kind words to appease Yuan Er. Once the latter had settled down some, Ning Zhuo finally moved on to his true goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Since you’ve already sided with us, we will do our best to help you keep the position of gang leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Your personal combat strength is a little lacking. According to Sir Fei Si’s plan, we’ll be building you a custom mechanical construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“This mechanical construct will have the power of Foundation Establishment, and will allow you to overpower those ambitious gang elders.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Oh?” Yuan Er’s eyes lit up with joy. This degree of support really reassured him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">But when he heard Ning Zhuo’s next words, his joy turned to fury, and he almost lashed out on the spot!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo nodded and said, “It’s good that you’re so agreeable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Now then, give me Yuan Dasheng. We’ll use it to craft a powerful mechanical monkey for you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Yuan Er almost leaped up in rage. “Impossible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He refused without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Hmm?!” Ning Zhuo immediately frowned. “Gang Leader Yuan Er, think it through!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“A strong mechanical construct requires excellent base materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Do you think we bought so many monkey corpses just to humiliate you? You overestimate yourself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Monkey corpses are the best base material for exceptional mechanical monkeys.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Yuan Er continuously shook his head. “Even so, I will never let you use my Uncle Monkey’s–”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo waved his hand impatiently and interrupted, “Enough. Yuan Er, are you really holding on to sentimentality at this point in time?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Let me be blunt. The materials must come from you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Only Yuan Dasheng’s corpse can allow us to create a top-tier mechanical monkey to protect you in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“We need you to remain the gang leader of the Monkey Head Gang, but what do you think the elders are planning?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Your personal strength is too weak, and you don’t have a powerful protector at your side. What will you do if the elders hire assassins to kill you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Yuan Er stayed silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo continued, “Only a fool waits until they see their coffin before starting to cry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“At that point, it’ll be too late!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“You’ve already chosen to side with us, so why not commit fully to it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Yuan Er firmly shook his head. “Mister Ning, there’s no need to continue trying to persuade me. Uncle Monkey has shown me immense kindness and contributed greatly to the gang. I want to care for him in his old age and let him live out his final years in peace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“If I can’t even do this, am I still human?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo’s eyes narrowed slightly. Deep down, he suddenly felt and impulse to punch Yuan Er dead on the spot, then go and kill Yuan Dasheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He had gone through all this effort precisely to get to Yuan Dasheng. Now, he was stuck at the final step, causing him to feel deep frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But he knew logically that he couldn’t act rashly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and calmed himself down before changing his tone. “Gang Leader Yuan Er’s virtue is truly admirable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“I respect that kind of character. I respect you!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“However… don’t you think you’re being a bit selfish?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Yuan Er widened his eyes in confusion. “You’re calling me selfish? If I were really selfish, I would have agreed right away to turn Uncle Monkey into a material for your mechanical construct!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo continued, “Gang leader, have you even thought about what your Uncle Monkey wants?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Yuan Er froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo said, “Your Uncle Monkey is brave and fearless and has always charged straight ahead, a true warrior among warriors. Between dying on the battlefield and wasting away in a bed, which do you think it would prefer?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“If your Uncle Monkey really becomes a cripple unable to even leave the bed, it would definitely feel worse than death. If you ask me, this so-called peaceful retirement is just you satisfying your sense of filial piety. For your Uncle Monkey, though, it’s nothing more than cruel humiliation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Yuan Er furrowed his brow, falling into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo’s eyes gleamed with a cold light. He smiled gently and said in a voice as soft as the spring breeze, “Why don’t you talk to your Uncle Monkey about it?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Your Uncle Monkey has done so much for you. If it really doesn’t want that kind of future, I believe it will be willing to give itself up. It will think that even if it dies, it can still accompany and protect you in another form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Why don’t you go ask it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Yuan Er looked up, his face pale and bloodless. His eyes were somewhat dazed as he muttered, “Yes… Mister Ning, what you said makes perfect sense. Why don’t I just ask Uncle Monkey?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Yuan Er left the small study and went to the master bedroom. He knelt before the bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Yuan Dasheng was still unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Yuan Er opened his mouth, trying to speak. But after several attempts, he couldn’t say a word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The mighty and towering figure in his memory was now as fragile as paper, no longer offering him any sense of safety or comfort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yuan Er’s thoughts grew scattered, and his gaze blanked out. Without realizing, tears began falling from his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">As his vision blurred, Yuan Er seemed to return to his past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">When he was small…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He used to climb on Yuan Dasheng’s body like scaling a crimson volcano.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">When he could walk and run…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Uncle Monkey, they’re bullying me!” Yuan Er would bring Yuan Dasheng to settle the score, scaring the other kids until they cried their lungs out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">When they played in the water…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“Eh? Uncle Monkey, why is mine so small and yours so big?” Little Yuan Er pointed at Yuan Dasheng’s crotch, his face full of curiosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">When he was a bit older…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Yuan Er grew braver and more inquisitive. “Uncle Monkey, between you and my dad, who’s stronger? Have you two ever fought? I asked my dad, but he never answers me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">After a victorious gang battle...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Yuan Er ran up to Yuan Dasheng, face full of admiration and excitement: “Uncle Monkey, you’re amazing! So powerful! When can I be like you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">And then, after that...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Things began to change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The cruel and cold reality shattered Yuan Er’s belief that he could become exceptional as long as he put in the effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Cultivation was based on talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“I’ll never be as strong as Uncle Monkey!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Uncle Monkey is really strong!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Uncle Monkey is super strong!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Uncle Monkey is much too strong...” The once awestruck boy became a gloomy young man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The same truth that once sparked admiration and reverence gradually gave rise to anxiety and paranoia.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“My father only built this foundation with Uncle Monkey’s help. When Father passes, will I be able to keep Uncle Monkey under control?” Yuan Er watched as his father grew weaker by the day due to irrecoverable injuries. His heart was full of worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“The Monkey Head Gang’s greatest strength is Uncle Monkey. Power is authority, but the core of that authority lies in Uncle Monkey. Is that really appropriate?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“Monkey Head Gang, Monkey Head Gang... is it a human gang or a monkey organization?” Seeing more and more monkey pets around him, Yuan Er felt lost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Watching the elders so terrified and deferential toward Yuan Dasheng, he felt a complicated mix of emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">In a gang battle, Yuan Er shouted, “No, don’t kill him!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Yuan Dasheng was already in a frenzy and unable to stop itself. It opened its mouth wide and bit the opposing cultivator clean in half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The enemy’s morale collapsed, and they began a full retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Yuan Er let out a deep sigh. “There’s no turning back now. We’ll have to go all out to completely eradicate the enemy gang.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Yuan Dasheng walked over holding half of the cultivator’s corpse, then suddenly handed it to Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Yuan Er jumped in fright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Seeing its prank succeed, Yuan Dasheng let out a mischievous giggle, unaware of the shadow growing in Yuan Er’s eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
