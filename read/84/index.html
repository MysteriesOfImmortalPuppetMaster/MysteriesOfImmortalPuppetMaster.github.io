<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 84: Something's Wrong, Young Master Meng Chong Has Fainted</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Yuan Dasheng let out a low howl. Its feet and hands slammed against the wall, and its scarlet golden body soared into the air like a rising dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After a few leaps, it arrived beneath Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">An instant later, its body suddenly spread open like a giant bow being pulled taut, radiating the beauty of vast power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Its right arm shot forward fiercely. Though clearly a heavy blow, it gave off a graceful and elegant impression, like a white crane spreading its wings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Then, Dasheng’s palm gently struck. Its five fingers, nimble as when it was alive, quickly grasped with Meng Chong’s puppet head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">A slight twist, a languid turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">As Yuan Dasheng landed, its toes were the first to reach the ground. Then came its arms, sliding smoothly down its sides like a cloak or a pair of wings. Though seemingly slow, they actually moved with such speed that brilliant red afterimages were left behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Strong winds howled in its wake, but the sound of it touching down was nearly silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In stark contrast, Meng Chong slammed to the ground with a loud bang that echoed through Room 3.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Yuan Dasheng let out a light breath and glanced at the head it had plucked from Meng Chong’s puppet body. With a flick of its wrist, its palm opened like flowing water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Meng Chong’s head dropped to the ground like a ball of wood. It rolled a bit from the momentum before coming to a stop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Even with the limited expressiveness of the puppet’s face, one could still faintly see the wide-eyed expression Meng Chong had at the moment of death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">At the same time, in the City Lord Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Meng Chong’s eyes suddenly snapped open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It was as if he had awoken from a nightmare. The feeling of death was vivid and raw, impressing itself deeply on his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Huff, huff!” He gasped heavily, his whole body drenched in cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">If Han Ming saw him now, she might not even recognize him. Currently, Meng Chong was all skin and bones, looking like a long-term invalid who couldn’t bear even a day of sunlight. His once-burly frame had withered, his cheekbones jutted out, and his eye sockets were sunken in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Once, his gaze had been alarmingly sharp. But now, his eyes were dull and lifeless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Strong... that mechanical ape was so strong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“But I won’t lose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“As long as I go through some special training, I can definitely make a comeback, defeat it, and clear that level!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Meng Chong had suffered a harsh setback, but he didn’t lose heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">However, just as he tried to sit up from the bed, that small movement alone made his vision go black. He passed out instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He fell back onto the bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The servants outside the room had heard noise earlier and knew that Meng Chong’s soul had returned to his body. Hearing this sound now, the servants immediately sensed something was wrong and called out urgently to no avail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The two servants turned red with anxiety. Full of panic, they conferred briefly before bursting through the door together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Young Master Meng Chong!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Something’s wrong! Young Master Meng Chong has fainted!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">With their echoing calls for help, chaos erupted in the City Lord Mansion’s rear courtyard. It was utter pandemonium.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In the underground workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo’s mouth was slightly open, unable to hide his surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This was beyond his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">It was much better than anticipated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng’s combat strength is far above Meng Chong’s.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Judging by this battle, although Meng Chong’s Ferocious Rushing Thunder has improved, he still can’t do anything to Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“The critical point is Meng Chong’s own condition. It seemed like he failed to use Ferocious Rushing Thunder.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo speculated that this was due to the soul entering the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Without a physical body, many things became inconvenient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">When Ning Zhuo used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal previously, he had needed to sense it through the Life-Hanging Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Meng Chong was in the same situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Activating Ferocious Rushing Thunder constantly drained the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit. This kind of consumption was already intense, and passing it through the Life-Hanging Thread caused even more loss. After it reached the puppet body, Meng Chong used it too recklessly and too often.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“If the battle was here in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Meng Chong’s Ferocious Rushing Thunder would be much more effective!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“In contrast, Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng is a mechanical construct and thus has the same strength inside and outside the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Dasheng’s close combat ability is incredibly powerful. Meng Chong is no match in this area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Before, Meng Chong could still rely on his immortal talent to hold his ground. But once he lost the ability to use it and Yuan Dasheng got close, he didn’t have a chance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Reaching this conclusion, Ning Zhuo once again felt a strong sense of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">After analyzing his intel, he had already anticipated Yuan Dasheng’s immense prowess in close combat. That was why, during his confrontation with the ape, he had avoided direct battle and didn’t even try an ambush or a sneak attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Facts proved how wise that decision had been.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Had he relied on brute force back then, he would’ve just been offering himself up to Yuan Dasheng on a silver platter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo calmed his mind, and his link with Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng gradually strengthened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">After a few breaths, a white teleportation circle formed out of thin air in front of Ning Zhuo, gradually expanding until it spat out Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was shorter than Ning Zhuo but far more robust and muscular. Even standing still, its scarlet-golden color and resolute expression made Ning Zhuo truly admire it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The young man rubbed both hands together. His grin came from the depths of his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He reached out and pinched Yuan Dasheng’s muscles, only to feel a chill. The mechanical Yuan Dasheng’s fur was extremely soft, while its exposed golden bones were incredibly hard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo’s puppet body hadn’t been able to feel these things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After checking it thoroughly, Ning Zhuo found that Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had gained a few minor injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">These were left by Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“The Lava Immortal Palace crafted this mechanical construct for Qi Refining stage trial disciples, so it didn’t use any top-grade materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Three Schools Supreme Sage probably wanted to give each trial disciple a decent quality mechanical construct for training.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Had the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit heard this analysis, it would definitely have been furious enough to spew fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">What do you mean, ‘decent quality’?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Is that even something a human should say?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Lava Immortal Palace used up an entire golden furnace for this! The choice of materials also reached the very limit allowed by the room’s standards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was the best of the best! Even those suspended coffins hanging in midair couldn’t compare to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">To put it in perspective, the normal standard was wooden blades or wooden swords. Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo’s mechanical construct was like a bronze or iron weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo attempted to repair the mechanized Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Its body of Vermilion Fire Glass had many fine cracks in it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Looking closely, its body was faintly translucent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The message delivered by the Lava Immortal Palace didn’t include a blueprint, but it did state that the body structure was made from Vermilion Flame Stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">And in Fire Persimmon Mountain, Vermilion Flame Stone was an abundant resource.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo had quite a bit of it stored in his materials warehouse. He immediately took some out, baked it, and produced a shining, translucent fluid that was colored a bright red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He dripped the fluid into the cracks. Soon, all of them were as good as new.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo then studied the monkey fur and revealed a troubled expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He couldn’t figure out how this monkey fur was made.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Thus, he decided to do things his way and created some monkey fur for Yuan Dasheng before stitching it to the naked areas of the body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">On the surface, it seemed to match well with the original pelt. But Ning Zhuo knew that the defensive performance had dropped significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">After finishing the repairs, Ning Zhuo began cleaning Yuan Dasheng's entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Finally, he took out a handkerchief and occasionally breathed warm air on it, polishing Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng’s golden bones until they gleamed without a speck of dust. Only then was he satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Just as he was preparing to closely study the mechanized Yuan Dasheng, someone arrived with a message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Some time later, the messenger departed. Ning Zhuo opened the letter and skimmed through it, slightly raising his eyebrows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The letter informed him to visit the Zhou Clan the next day. He was to attend an examination to check his cultivation progress and then use the Zhou Clan’s formation to aid his practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“So the Ning Clan has allied with Zhou Clan?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Hm… then the Zheng Clan is likely involved as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“The three clans have united. What about the City Lord Mansion?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo wasn’t surprised. This shift in the situation was within his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">What made him pause was what kind of image he should present to the three great clans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">After thinking for a short while, Ning Zhuo made a decision. “It’s time to show off some mechanical talent and steal a bit of spotlight.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
