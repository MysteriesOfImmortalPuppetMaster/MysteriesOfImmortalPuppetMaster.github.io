<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Zhu Zhen listened to Zhu Xuanji's account and suddenly realized the reasoning behind Zhu Xuanji's previous deductions. <br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, having been favored by the Sage of the Three Sects during its lifetime, was naturally extraordinary!<br/>
<br/>
To refine its soul, the first Golden Furnace was used. <br/>
<br/>
To forge its dragon body, the second Golden Furnace was used up. <br/>
<br/>
Now, not even seven hundred and twenty years have passed, and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had used its serpent body as the main material to forge a Nascent Soul-level mechanical construct — the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen calculated, "The Lava Immortal Palace is like a prison to it. It can no longer endure the days of serving as the palace spirit, so it desires to escape." <br/>
<br/>
"And to escape, it must break the prison, which means destroying the Lava Immortal Palace." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji sighed deeply, "The current situation is quite tricky." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen was puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji continued to transmit his voice, revealing many hidden secrets. <br/>
<br/>
At that time, he was in the royal family's secret vault and saw more than just the scene of the Immortal Palace's burial in the mountain; there were other images as well.<br/>
<br/>
The late Supreme Empress of the Southern Bean Kingdom left a will advising future generations: After relentless efforts in her later years, she made many significant new discoveries about the Lava Immortal Palace and the Sage of the Three Sects.<br/>
<br/>
"The Lava Immortal Palace was not just a casual move by the Sage of the Three Sects." <br/>
<br/>
"His intentions are profound." <br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace not only contains Mechanism Arts inheritance and the Sage's methods but also the divine ability Life-Hanging Thread!<br/>
<br/>
Even on her deathbed, the Supreme Empress was still concerned about the affairs of the Southern Bean Kingdom: "If our Zhu family does not have a royal mandate, we must strive to grasp the divine ability Life-Hanging Thread." <br/>
<br/>
"The divine ability seed in the Lava Immortal Palace is the key to mastering the Life-Hanging Thread, and it must be obtained." <br/>
<br/>
She also said, "The supreme power of the Lava Immortal Palace is divided into three parts."<br/>
<br/>
"One part is the position of the palace master, one part is the palace spirit Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, and the last part is the Buddha Heart Demon Seal." <br/>
<br/>
"The first two can be contested, but the Buddha Heart Demon Seal must not be touched."<br/>
<br/>
"This seal has a significant origin, relating to the struggle between the Buddhist realm and the Demon realm. It carries a massive amount of karma. If ordinary cultivators or forces accept this seal, their fate energy will be severely depleted until it becomes weak or even exhausted, triggering numerous calamities." <br/>
<br/>
"If, in the future, the Zhu family of the Southern Bean Kingdom has neither a royal mandate nor someone who has mastered the divine ability Life-Hanging Thread, it will be challenging to maintain the country's situation with limited fate energy and difficult national fortune." <br/>
<br/>
"In such circumstances, one must not covet immediate benefits. Taking the Buddha Heart Demon Seal will bring about national turmoil, external threats, internal chaos, and ultimately lead to the downfall of the country and the ruin of the ruler. All foundations will go to waste."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen listened to Zhu Xuanji's account, and his face involuntarily showed a worried expression. <br/>
<br/>
"The treasure seal cannot be taken, and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit wants to escape. If we want to control the Lava Immortal Palace, we must obtain the position of palace master." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji looked up, gazing at the broken spherical light shield in the sky, "The situation now is even more complicated." <br/>
<br/>
"Not only do we need to seize the position of palace master, but we also have to thwart the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's escape plan!"<br/>
<br/>
"We do not understand how to control the Lava Immortal Palace. Even if we become the palace master, it will be difficult to immediately control the entire Lava Immortal Palace well." <br/>
<br/>
"Once the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit leaves, the Lava Immortal Palace, lacking a host, will see its defenses plummet to the bottom." <br/>
<br/>
"The scarlet flames will blaze, and the beast tide will be fierce. By then, the beast tide will rush in without hindrance, quickly engulfing the entire Immortal Palace!" <br/>
<br/>
"Unless someone like Meng Kui, at the Nascent Soul level, can use his own power to protect the entire Immortal Palace?" <br/>
<br/>
"With our Golden Core cultivation, we should not entertain such wishful thinking." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen nodded in agreement, his expression heavy.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji clasped his hands behind his back, paced in a small circle, and after some thought, instructed Zhu Zhen. <br/>
<br/>
The most important task at this time was to fully search for the hiding place of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon. If they could intercept this construct in advance, it would undoubtedly disrupt the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's escape plan.<br/>
<br/>
"This is very difficult," Zhu Zhen transmitted his voice, expressing, "The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon can change size and is surely highly valued by the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit and hidden very deeply. In this vast Lava Immortal Palace, finding such a target is like finding a needle in a haystack." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji further instructed him to keep an eye on the Golden Furnace ruins.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said, "The ruins of the third and fourth Golden Furnaces have been blasted beyond recognition, but there's still a small part that has merged with the surroundings." <br/>
<br/>
"You need to find an opportunity to approach again, excavate the surface, and then refine and restore its previous form." <br/>
<br/>
"I always feel that there are important clues buried in the third and fourth Golden Furnaces."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen felt even more challenged and transmitted his voice, "Brother, the reason we were able to enter the Golden Furnace ruins this time was due to deliberate design. We also seized the excellent opportunity of the conflict between the Shadow Demon Cultivator and Yang Chanyu." <br/>
<br/>
"With the cunning of the Void Sect, even if they blasted that Golden Furnace ruin, they probably won't easily give us another chance." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded, acknowledging Zhu Zhen's analysis.<br/>
<br/>
To break the current predicament, two general paths could be taken. <br/>
<br/>
One was to focus on objects, specifically the mechanical structures. <br/>
<br/>
In Zhu Xuanji's view, the Void Sect could restrict their approach to the Golden Furnace ruins mainly by relying on the Five Elements Cannon Watchtower and the Command Platform.<br/>
<br/>
If Zhu Xuanji could decipher the Void Sect's control methods and use the demon beasts to enter the Golden Furnace ruins, there would be no obstacles. <br/>
<br/>
The other path was to focus on people, specifically Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
However, those two were extremely slippery, hiding within the Lava Immortal Palace, making them impossible to find. <br/>
<br/>
This time, it was only because Yang Chanyu was forced out by the Shadow Demon Cultivator that she revealed her whereabouts outside the palace examination.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen transmitted his voice, "Recently, I've been pondering the current situation and suddenly thought of another person who might become our breakthrough point." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji turned his head, "Oh? Tell me about it." Zhu Zhen said, "It is Chui Tiao Ke!"<br/>
<br/>
"Previously, Chui Tiao Ke, along with Han Ming and Sun Lingtong, attacked the Purple Sun Courtyard. Later, he risked his life using his Foundation Establishment cultivation to fight against the Golden Core Qi Bai, and ultimately managed to forcibly rescue Sun Lingtong. Various clues indicate that his mechanical skills are quite remarkable."<br/>
<br/>
"I strongly suspect that Chui Tiao Ke might be the one controlling the Five Elements Cannon Watchtower and the Command Platform." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji inquired, "Do you have any basis for this suspicion?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen simply said, "With this sort of Mechanism cultivator in the Void Sect, how could they not use him? Unless the battle with Qi Bai left Chui Tiao Ke severely injured and recuperating, he should be hiding deep within the Lava Immortal Palace, constantly monitoring the Golden Furnace ruins and preventing us from approaching."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji slightly shook his head, "I understand."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen continued, "Chui Tiao Ke appeared in the black market very early on, always selling a type of mechanical rope called the Up-and-Down Ruyi Rope." <br/>
<br/>
"Among the cultivators exploring Fire Persimmon Mountain, this rope is very popular."<br/>
<br/>
"Even now, the market and many cultivators still have the Up-and-Down Ruyi Rope." <br/>
<br/>
"I think it would be better to collect these mechanical ropes and hand them over to you, brother, for investigation."<br/>
<br/>
"Under your Heaven-Piercing Eyes, we should be able to find important clues about Chui Tiao Ke, or even flaws!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji laughed heartily, unable to resist patting Zhu Zhen's shoulder, "Good lad, no wonder you've been training outside for so many years. Your thinking is meticulous and unique, much stronger than before." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen, knowing Zhu Xuanji well, saw his lack of interest and couldn't help but feel puzzled, asking, "Brother, what are you really thinking? Is there something wrong with the clue I've grasped?" <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji sighed, his expression complex, "It's not wrong, it's just that I fear I've already guessed Chui Tiao Ke's identity." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen couldn't help but widen his eyes, "If you've guessed it, why don't you go and capture him, brother?"<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he realized. "If brother doesn't go to capture him, it means he doesn't need to, or perhaps he can't... Could it be?!" <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen suddenly turned his head, instinctively looking towards the residence of the Ning Family Clan Leader, Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said softly, "During the previous palace examination, cultivators could invite outsiders as helpers, but on Sun Lingtong's side, a mechanical cultivator like Chui Tiao Ke never appeared. At that time, I found it strange." <br/>
<br/>
Saying this, Zhu Xuanji patted Zhu Zhen's shoulder, "Of course, this is just my guess. If you're interested, you can indeed go collect the Up-and-Down Ruyi Rope. However, I think that after the Void Sect was exposed, the City Lord's Mansion will surely investigate all clues thoroughly."<br/>
<br/>
"Although Meng Kui is stationed at the mountain peak, the acting City Lord Fei Si is also a capable person. With his ability, he has probably already gathered a batch of Up-and-Down Ruyi Rope. If you want to save some effort, you might as well write to him and directly request a batch of mechanical ropes." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen opened his mouth, finally sighed, "I understand." <br/>
<br/>
After a pause, he sincerely praised, "As expected of you, brother!" <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji smiled wryly, encouraging, "Go and do your work."<br/>
<br/>
"Based on my limited understanding of the Sage of the Three Sects, the palace examination probably only has three stages." <br/>
<br/>
"Now, the second stage of the palace examination is likely nearing its end."<br/>
<br/>
"The situation is too tense! There is a beast tide outside while the Void Sect is causing chaos inside. There are many things, but we can only focus on the big picture and let go of the small details."<br/>
<br/>
"If the situation were stable, with a large margin for error, we could pursue everything. But now, we can only unite allies, conserve energy and time, and focus on one main focus under the pressure of the big picture." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen could feel Zhu Xuanji's helplessness. With his face full of a sense of being taught, "Brother's teachings, I will remember them in my heart." <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen was originally a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and had a deep friendship with Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
He was now extremely grateful that he took the route on the cloud whale, ultimately reuniting with Zhu Xuanji and contributing to this major event in support of his brother.<br/>
<br/>
After receiving this important task, he disregarded the difficulties and went all out. <br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace's light shield had many breaches. The outer area had basically fallen, allowing demon beasts to roam freely, while the inner circle still maintained its line.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen conducted a search, first skipping the outer circle and only searching within the inner circle. He searched many places, thoroughly investigating each one, but couldn't find even a trace of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
During this time, he still wrote a letter and sent it to Fei Si. However, it was no longer to request the Up-and-Down Ruyi Rope, but to directly inquire about all the intelligence the City Lord's Mansion had on Chui Tiao Ke.<br/>
