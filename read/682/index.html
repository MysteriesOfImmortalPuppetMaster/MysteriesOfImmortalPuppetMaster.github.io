<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The meal was a delightful affair, enjoyed by both host and guests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo, Yu Heye, and Shen Xi forged a stronger bond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo found himself agreeing with Shen Xi's pragmatic decision-making.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Seizing the opportunity, Ning Zhuo inquired about the Nine Palaces Formation, subtly revealing his interest in the Array Dao Magical Treasure left behind by Xie Tang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">As Ning Zhuo put it, "I've always been fascinated by the Array Dao. I believe that exchanging insights with Fellow Daoist Shen will lead to some modest progress in my understanding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Perhaps Senior Xie Tang's Array Dao Magical Treasure could serve as a test of my current knowledge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Of course, even if my Array Dao skills allow me to obtain the treasure, I would still carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of joining Heavy Array Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Ultimately, having another path to consider would be quite beneficial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Xie Tang's decision to establish a Formation here, leave behind the Array Dao Magical Treasure, and widely publicize its existence - he certainly wouldn't have kept this secret confined to the lecture halls of Nine Palaces Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The reason for this widespread dissemination was clear to anyone with eyes: to attract talented individuals from beyond the city to join Heavy Array Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Array Dao Magical Treasure here served as a trial, allowing Xie Tang to efficiently filter out cultivators with Array Dao proficiency who were interested in joining Heavy Array Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Such arrangements were common in the Cultivation World.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Array Dao Magical Treasures weren't easily obtained. While they appeared to be gifts for the destined, they always concealed ulterior motives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Why would anyone offer a magic treasure as a mere game reward without any other purpose? There's no such thing as a free lunch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Chess Maniac's search for a suitable heir to his friend's legacy followed the same principle. Ling Xiao, a Quasi-Deified Sword Cultivator, was deemed unsuitable (his path already set), resulting in his retreat with severe injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Even after death, many cultivators would leave additional tasks within their legacies. These might include ensuring the continuation of their lineage, glorifying a sect, or seeking vengeance against their enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In short, karma always played a role.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Truly selfless gifts were exceedingly rare in practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Take Xie Tang's Array Dao Magical Treasure, for example. A naive or inexperienced young cultivator who passed the trial and claimed it would inevitably be drawn into joining Heavy Array Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">But don't mistake this for a good thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo already foresaw the future: this year's Flying Cloud Assembly at Myriad Manifestations Sect would be different from previous years. It marked a critical transition between the old and the new, promising brutal competition. In such a scenario, newly recruited cultivators would undoubtedly become River-Crossing Pawns in this fierce game, with the weakest among them serving as cannon fodder to fill the front lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Someone asked, "Why not just take the Array Dao Magical Treasure and not join Heavy Array Peak? Xie Tang didn't explicitly announce his intentions, did he? We could just pretend we didn't understand his meaning, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The person who said this was remarkably naive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Doing so would be tantamount to cutting oneself off from the power dynamics of Myriad Manifestations Sect - no one would cooperate with someone who so blatantly disregarded the rules.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">While the sect had few explicit rules, it operated under a far greater number of unspoken ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">These unspoken rules, gradually forged through internal power struggles, exerted a powerful constraint on all cultivators within the sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">In truth, the Flying Cloud Assembly, this seemingly straightforward system, was actually an excellent solution born from the complex interplay of various factions. It resolved internal conflicts, determined outcomes, and suppressed excessive infighting, preventing it from becoming too brutal. It also absorbed fresh blood from the outside world, replenishing the Myriad Manifestations Sect's ranks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"This is precisely one of the reasons for the Myriad Manifestations Sect's strength," Ning Zhuo mused inwardly. "It's like the Myriad Phenomena Cloud Sea, constantly expanding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After the banquet, his understanding of the sect's dynamics had become much clearer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Because Ning Zhuo had asked Shen Xi so many questions, Shen Xi immediately produced a Jade Slip and presented it to him as they parted ways.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"These are my lecture notes, containing information about the Nine Palaces Formation and Senior Xie Tang's magic treasure. I offer them to you, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo. Please don't find them lacking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo's face lit up with delight. After storing the Jade Slip, he pondered for a moment before retrieving a Golden Core and offering it to Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This startled the other three cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">A Foundation Establishment cultivator casually producing a Golden Core!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Yu Heye felt a chill run down his spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">At that moment, Su Lingkou realized Ning Zhuo wasn't just boasting. She knew one thing for certain: if he could casually offer a Golden Core as a gift, he must possess more than just one!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Shen Xi hastily waved his hand in refusal, his impression of Ning Zhuo rising even higher. "The power behind Ning Zhuo must be immense. For a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator to be granted a Golden Core by his sect, his status within that organization must be exceptionally high!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"This is far too precious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"My Array Dao notes are simply not worth a Golden Core!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Is this... a Ghost Path Golden Core?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Though Shen Xi vehemently refused, his gaze remained irresistibly drawn to the core, piquing his curiosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Obtaining a Golden Core ahead of time for research would grant him a deeper understanding of the subsequent cultivation realms - an invaluable opportunity for Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He couldn't help but wonder, "If I used a Golden Core as the Formation Core, how powerful would the resulting Formation be?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The thought was irresistibly tempting, lingering in his mind and refusing to be suppressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo, ever observant, noticed the yearning deep in Shen Xi's eyes. With a hearty laugh, he pressed the Golden Core into Shen Xi's hand, "insisting" that he accept it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">When Shen Xi's fingers touched the icy surface of the Golden Core, they recoiled slightly at first. But he quickly gripped it firmly, reluctant to let go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">His inner voice grew stronger, and Ning Zhuo's "forceful" demeanor only underscored his sincerity and determination, making it even harder for Shen Xi to refuse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Finally, he nodded with difficulty and accepted the Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">But in the next moment, he retrieved a magic treasure and offered it to Ning Zhuo in return: "This Formation Gap Shuttle has been invaluable for my exploration and study of Formations, as well as for fine-tuning them after deployment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Since Brother Ning is interested in the Array Dao and eager to learn, I urge you to make full use of this treasure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"If you uncover any clues, this shuttle can help you delve deeper. Who knows, you might even discover the magic treasure left behind by Senior Xie Tang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo hadn't expected any reciprocation, but Shen Xi, born into a prominent clan, possessed innate grace and would never take advantage of others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Having received elite education since childhood, he understood that seizing petty advantages often led to greater debts in the long run.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Moreover, the magic treasure Shen Xi offered struck right at Ning Zhuo's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Next, I'll secretly explore Vine-Clasping Cliff to find Mother's teleportation formation. This Formation Gap Shuttle is perfect for my needs!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">With this thought, Ning Zhuo accepted the gift without further hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Su Lingkou's gaze remained fixed on the Formation Gap Shuttle. She secretly worried about Shen Xi: "This is Cousin's most useful magic treasure, a reward from the family for his top ranking in the Great Examination. It holds immense significance for him. I never imagined he'd give it away so easily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Ah, Cousin only has three magic treasures. Though this one isn't a weapon for offense or defense - it's just a support tool, and a Golden Core-level treasure at that - it's still a magic treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Even though he received a Golden Core in exchange, which is indeed rare, is it really more valuable to Cousin than the Formation Gap Shuttle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Su Lingkou secretly calculated the value of the exchange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Meanwhile, Shen Xi breathed a sigh of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At the banquet, Ning Zhuo had successfully used Yu Heye to subtly demonstrate his assertive nature. This further solidified Shen Xi's conviction that contacting Ning Zhuo had been the right decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Yet he never expected that, upon parting, Ning Zhuo would directly gift him a Golden Core!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This gift doubled Shen Xi's anxiety!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo's generosity only deepened Shen Xi's concern that the former might later make some difficult demands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yet Shen Xi couldn't refuse such a lavish gift without causing a scene. He still wanted to maintain good relations with Ning Zhuo, after all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Who would want to sour relations with someone who casually hands out Golden Cores as gifts?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Therefore, Shen Xi preferred to give away the Formation Gap Shuttle in advance, preemptively settling this debt. This way, he could effectively silence Ning Zhuo, preventing him from making any future requests that Shen Xi might find impossible to fulfill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The group formally parted ways. Ning Zhuo left Vine-Clasping Cliff and returned to his temporary cave dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">From his Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon, he released Old Chef, Qing Chi, and Sun Lingtong, instructing them to jointly examine the unexpectedly acquired magic treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Treasure Shuttle measured just over three inches long, its frame crafted from jade-green jade, with stardust swirling within. The shuttle's surface was etched with intricate cloud and water patterns, its bow and stern adorned with Chiwen eyes that emitted a faint, pale-blue glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The grip was wrapped in a band of deep-blue vine bark, while the stern was embellished with Five Elements Barrier-Breaking Tassels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Qing Chi merely marveled at its novelty, but Old Chef and Sun Lingtong thoroughly inspected it and confirmed that it was flawless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up the moment he saw the Treasure Shuttle. His small hands ceaselessly stroked its surface. "I've always wanted to acquire a treasure like this to enhance my thieving skills. This shuttle is far superior to anything sold on the market - truly worthy of the Shen Clan of Nine Palaces Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "Big Brother, if you want it, I'll give it to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong accepted without ceremony, not even offering a word of thanks, merely grunting in acknowledgment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The two communicated through divine sense, careful not to reveal their true relationship in front of Qing Chi and Old Chef. Sun Lingtong continued to maintain the facade of a subordinate, "serving" Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">To Qing Chi and Old Chef, Ning Zhuo was a noble young master from a prominent clan, while Sun Lingtong was merely his young attendant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Of course, neither of them dared underestimate Sun Lingtong in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">After all, it was Sun Lingtong who had previously disguised himself as multiple Foundation Establishment cultivators and effortlessly defeated Yu Heye's subordinates in the Martial Arts Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sun Lingtong's cultivation was on par with Shen Xi's, both at the peak of Foundation Establishment. Back in White Paper Immortal City, he had even considered advancing to Golden Core Formation, but the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's affairs had delayed his plans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After their divine sense exchange, Ning Zhuo immediately ordered Old Chef and Sun Lingtong to relocate to Vine-Clasping Cliff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Their primary mission was for Sun Lingtong, with Old Chef as his assistant, to refine the Formation Gap Shuttle and actively explore the teleportation formation within the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">As for Qing Chi, due to her amnesia, Ning Zhuo decided to keep her by his side for care.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong and Old Chef immediately accepted their orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo then retrieved the Jade Slip given to him by Shen Xi and had everyone study it together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Old Chef, with his limited knowledge of the Array Dao, quickly reviewed the contents and declared his willingness to follow Sun Lingtong's instructions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Sun Lingtong, however, devoured the information with relish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">His mastery of the Array Dao surpassed even Ning Zhuo's!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">While Ning Zhuo possessed a solid foundation in array fundamentals, Sun Lingtong had delved into a wider range of classical texts and possessed extensive practical experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Little Zhuo, we're fortunate. If we had tried to tackle this alone from the start, we would likely have failed and been exposed. The formations here are incredibly complex!" Sun Lingtong transmitted through divine sense, his voice tinged with relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement, thinking to himself, My mother's ability to construct teleportation formations is no small feat. She likely knows the Mountain-Protecting Grand Arrays at Vine-Clasping Cliff and Cloud-Scraping Peak, as well as the layout of the Xietang Nine Palaces Array. Otherwise, attempting to establish a teleportation formation would easily clash with these three Grand Formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo's deduction wasn't mere speculation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">In White Paper Immortal City, within the Paper Giant, he had personally witnessed Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's astonishing feat of repairing the Colossus's formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">At that moment, he was utterly captivated by his mother's unfathomable mastery of the Array Dao!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Sun Lingtong nodded, a glint of confidence flashing in his eyes. "I think the same way. If we can deduce the principles behind these three formations, we should be able to pinpoint the teleportation formation's location."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"I'm convinced we'll find it soon!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo shared his confidence. "Of course we will."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Don't forget, we foiled the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme, earning Yang Heaven's favor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"We're currently blessed by Heaven's Favor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Otherwise, how else would we have gotten exactly what we needed when we needed it? Shen Xi just happened to send us this Jade Slip."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Sun Lingtong nodded. "If it weren't for the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Qi Luck-suppressing spiritual treasure, the blessings we'd receive would be even more extravagant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"I really want a Fate Divination inheritance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Hey, Little Zhuo, your aunt is so skilled in divination. Do you think her cave might contain a Fate Divination inheritance?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up with anticipation. "If it does, that would be incredible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Having fought the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, the Sun-Ning brothers had gained a profound understanding of Qi Luck and Fate. Both yearned for a Fate Divination inheritance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Sun Lingtong and Old Chef successfully entered their respective cave dwellings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Yu Heye, once their greatest obstacle, had now become their greatest asset.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Sun Lingtong activated the Earth Evasion Art and sank into the mountain's embrace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He moved through the earth as freely as swimming, yet still encountered obstacles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Deep within the mountain, countless vine roots, resembling a coiled python, had burrowed into the rock. These roots constantly pulsed with Yi Wood spiritual energy, rendering the Earth Evasion Art ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Sun Lingtong wasn't surprised; he had anticipated this situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He continuously detoured, searching for passages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">He couldn't act rashly. Severing these vine roots might trigger a counterattack from the Thousand Vines Drinking Cloud Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">In this situation, the Formation Gap Shuttle proved invaluable. Even without its other functions, the Five Elements Formation-Breaking Silk Tassel alone allowed Sun Lingtong to bypass the vine root barriers directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The Treasure Shuttle could also squeeze through gaps in the Great Formation, allowing Sun Lingtong to slip through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Sun Lingtong's child-like, petite frame was perfectly suited for such exploration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"I've found the teleportation formation," Sun Lingtong announced shortly after discovering a stone chamber within the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The chamber was small, containing only a single teleportation formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Symbols on the walls hinted at Meng Yaoyin's identity, though only Ning Zhuo recognized them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Little Zhuo, I'll go in first to scout ahead," Sun Lingtong communicated to Ning Zhuo before activating the teleportation formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In an instant, he was transported to the Jade Cleansing Emperor's realm.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
