<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 687: Five Elements Generation and Destruction Art</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the Phenomenon Talisman Stage, the key lies in a cultivator's comprehension of their Cultivation Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Once their understanding reaches the required level, they can form a complete Innate Spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The manifestation of Innate Spells varies widely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Within Ning Zhuo's Qi Sea, the Innate Spell of the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual had fully materialized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">It radiated five-colored light and constantly shifted its form. When only one color was present, it appeared as a perfect sphere. With two colors, it transformed into a pair of horns. Three colors formed a triangle, four colors a quadrilateral, and when all five colors converged, it became a three-dimensional pentagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Of course, this was only a rough external observation. Upon closer inspection, the pentagram revealed intricate, precise, and constantly evolving talisman patterns compressed to their absolute limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Five Qi Generation and Destruction Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Having fully comprehended the technique, Ning Zhuo naturally understood its immense power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This art represented the ultimate application of the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual. The manual's strength lay in its mastery of the Five Elements, their cycles of generation and destruction, and their harmonious unity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Five Qi Generation and Destruction Art allowed direct manipulation of any of the Five Elements magical power, enabling precise control over their generative and destructive interactions. By simultaneously controlling all five elements, the resulting effects were dozens of times greater than before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">For example, Ning Zhuo previously needed to convert all his spiritual energy into the Wood Element. Since he could only control one type of spiritual energy at a time, he had to start by converting his Fire Element spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">One unit of Fire Element spiritual energy would generate two units of Earth Element spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Fire Element spiritual energy would be completely consumed in the process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo, now controlling Earth Element spiritual energy, began generating Metal Element spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After the Metal Element spiritual energy was completely consumed, it produced double the amount of Water Element spiritual energy, at which point Ning Zhuo switched to controlling only the Water Element spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Finally, the Water Element spiritual energy transformed into Wood Element spiritual energy. Through this process, the Five Elements magical power was purified into a single element, and its scale expanded more than sixfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Each conversion required time, even when Ning Zhuo exerted his full effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">But now, under the Five Qi Generation and Destruction Art, the Five Elements magical power could be converted simultaneously. This qualitative shift in speed drastically reduced the time required, allowing the entire process to be completed in just two or three breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo extended his palm, channeling the Five Elements magical power. A vine sprouted from his palm - one of his two most proficient Earth Element Techniques: Root Vine Entanglement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He immediately sensed the difference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Previously, to cast this spell quickly, he had been limited to using the Wood Element among the Five Elements Techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Now, with only a slight delay, he could convert all his Five Elements magical power into the Wood Element, increasing its scale by more than sixfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Worth it!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed, immensely satisfied as he saw the vines in his hand more than six times larger after casting the spell a second time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He proceeded to cast other single-element spells, discovering that the Five Elements Generation and Destruction Art significantly enhanced their performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Especially - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Five Qi Torrent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo spread his fingers and pressed down on the air before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Immediately, five-colored spiritual energy erupted forth, forming a spiraling torrent that surged forward with tremendous force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Suddenly, Ning Zhuo's expression shifted slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Under his control, the Five Qi Torrent began to shimmer and transform. At times, it glowed crimson, reflecting on his face; at others, it surged like a pitch-black, ink-like deluge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Even after being cast, the Five Qi Torrent, empowered by the Five Elements Generation and Destruction Art, could still undergo the cyclical transformations of the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"If that's the case..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo attempted to convert it into a single-element form and succeeded. The torrent's volume suddenly expanded more than sixfold, but its spiraling rotation vanished. This wasn't a pure enhancement; the single-element spiritual energy allowed for more focused attacks, while the Five Qi Torrent excelled in handling complex enemy situations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">With his profound understanding of the Five Elements, Ning Zhuo immediately seized the opportunity to design an improved spell: the Five Qi Torrent Transformation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">It was clear that the Five Elements Generation and Destruction Art was an auxiliary spell. Activating it allowed cultivators to greatly enhance their control over Five Elements magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">However, this assistance vanished instantly when the spell was deactivated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual already emphasized strict control over the Five Elements, and the Five Qi Generation and Destruction Art, its core technique, pushed this principle to its extreme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Wait a minute," Ning Zhuo suddenly realized. "What if I activate the Five Viscera Spirit God Art at the same time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He immediately divided his divine sense into five strands, each entering the Spirit God Temple within one of his five viscera. The divine statues within the temples instantly came to life, radiating lifelike vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">As a result, his control over Five Elements Techniques immediately reached a level of meticulous precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The effects of both techniques were remarkably similar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">To Ning Zhuo's delight, the two techniques didn't cancel each other out or become ineffective. Instead, their effects perfectly stacked!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Previously, when Ning Zhuo had used the Five Viscera Spirit God Art, Wen Ruanyu, Yang Sanyan, and others had marveled at his mastery of Five Elements Techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Now, with this combined enhancement, Ning Zhuo's control over Five Elements Techniques had reached an exceptionally high level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">This advantage immediately became apparent in his spell practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo selected several unfamiliar spells and began practicing them on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">In the superimposed state, Ning Zhuo's control over spells was astonishing, even those he had just learned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Throughout his practice, he constantly made adjustments. No matter how subtle the refinement, Ning Zhuo could execute it flawlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Cough, cough, cough..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo released the superimposed state, his face pale as he coughed weakly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">While the superimposed state offered immense benefits, it placed an overwhelming burden on his divine sense. After all, he had previously used the Five Viscera Spirit God Art by activating only a single Divine Viscera Temple at a time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In contrast, the Five Qi Generation and Destruction Art, having condensed into a talisman, required only the infusion of spiritual energy, making it remarkably convenient to use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This was the true advantage of having an Innate Spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo began practicing a completely new spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">When activating only the Five Elements Generation and Destruction Art or the Five Viscera Spirit God Art, the practice efficiency was roughly ten times greater than in an unenhanced state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But in the superimposed state, the practice efficiency skyrocketed to over a hundred times greater!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The enhancement effects of the two techniques synergized multiplicatively rather than additively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"This is truly incredible!" Ning Zhuo felt genuine joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Although Ning Zhuo possessed a profound understanding of the Five Elements, he had never had the time to practice the corresponding spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He had been forced to learn through combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">However, thanks to the Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art, even without dedicated practice, he could execute these spells at combat-ready levels, often achieving remarkable results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Now, Ning Zhuo could finally devote himself to rigorous practice, truly mastering each of the Five Elements Techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">This would undoubtedly lead to a significant boost in his combat prowess!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">For a time, Ning Zhuo immersed himself completely in practicing the Five Elements Techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">His progress was astonishingly rapid. After just three or four repetitions of a new spell, he could already execute it with flair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This rapid growth filled Ning Zhuo with a sense of accomplishment, so much so that he completely forgot about Shen Xi's letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Martial Arts Branch Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Su Lingkou stood beside Shen Xi, her initial anticipation for Ning Zhuo's arrival turning to disappointment. "Cousin, Ning Zhuo didn't come at all. He didn't even reply to my letter. Is he afraid?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Shen Xi shook his head. "Seclusion for cultivation and neglecting correspondence are common occurrences. There's no need to worry."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Su Lingkou: "But..."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
