<paragraph index="26">That's the gist of the announcement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">First Big Event Summary!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">Written by: Lin Xiaoyun 🔥 Everyone 👥 2542 times viewed 📆 September 18, 2024, 10:02 am</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I started a meeting with my partners, starting at 7 p.m., and the discussion went on until 11 p.m.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">In total, we identified many problems in this first major event, and we also worked out solutions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">First, I want to apologize!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">First, I was too ambitious. I let my passion for writing and the excitement of the event get the better of me. I promised everyone multiple updates and content releases, but I couldn’t follow through with my schedule. Not only did I let myself down, but I also let you all down. I'm sorry for not delivering the expected updates!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">I apologize! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Second, I was short on time and energy, which led to the event gifts being delayed. I’ve been trying hard to keep up but still missed the deadlines. For this, I also apologize to everyone for the 5-day delay in shipments!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sorry again! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Working with my partners, I’ve been managing the event by myself, including hosting and organizing things in my spare time. Next time, I’ll definitely reflect on this experience and improve. We will work harder to make things more seamless and well-coordinated for the upcoming events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">I hope you'll continue to support and enjoy the content. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Alright, now to talk about my feelings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Whew...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Honestly, I feel like a robot that’s been hit with a hammer and finished a race on a track made of mud. I’m both mentally and physically exhausted, yet somehow, I can still feel a weird sense of happiness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">I’ve realized that I’ve been pushing myself too hard and never truly stopped to rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Pressure has piled up like waves crashing on me. I feel like I'm a star shining brightest under the most intense pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The pressure of keeping up with updates is the hardest. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">《Reverend Insanity》 was released on December 15, 2012, at 6:28 AM, starting with “Prologue: There is no path to success, only paths leading to destruction.” It was updated until May 30, 2019, at 8:00 PM, reaching “Chapter 368: Source, Giant Sun Star Residence,” with a total of 7.335 million words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">《Infinite Bloodcore》 was released on March 8, 2020, at 12:17 PM, starting with “A very important statement,” updated until January 25, 2024, at 9:30 PM, reaching “Chapter 756: Decisive Battle with the God of War, This is mine!” with 3.141 million words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">On 2024-04-2008:01, "Xiangong Kaiwu" published the preface "Three Challenges of Leaving the Mountain", and on 2024-09-17 07:56,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">《Mysteries of the Immortal puppet master》 was released on April 20, 2024, at 8:01 AM, starting with “The Three Swords from the Mountains,” updated until July 17, 2024, at 7:56 AM, reaching “Chapter 327: I have to execute this!!!” with a total of 967,000 words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">《Reverend Insanity》 updates roughly 1.127 million words per year, about 95,000 words per month, and about 3.1 thousand words per day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">《Infinite Bloodcore》 updates around 820,000 words per year, about 68,000 words per month, and around 2.2 thousand words per day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">《Mysteries of the Immortal puppet master》 updates around 1.934 million words per year, about 193,000 words per month, and about 5.5 thousand words per day. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">From this, we can know that the update volume of "Xiangong Kaiwu" is about 1.775 times that of "Gu Zhenren" and about 2.5 times that of "Infinite Blood Core".</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This update speed is unprecedented in my history of writing books! When I was young and at the peak of my physical strength, I never reached of</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">The pressure is really too great!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">By the middle and late stages of the first volume, I was completely confused. My body and mind were severely challenged. My willpower had dropped significantly, and the quality of my writing had also dropped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Here, I would also like to apologize to everyone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">In fact, I have been gritting my teeth and persevering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Slowly, slowly, I came out of my numb state and gradually adapted. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">All I can say is "adaptation", just like being beaten for a long time and getting used to the pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This gave me great respect for my colleagues!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">It is already extremely difficult to update twice a day steadily. I heard there is a higher level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">How is that even possible? </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Fortunately, towards the end of writing this volume, as I got used to the rhythm, my spirit gradually recovered a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The climax at the end took several consecutive days of intense effort to complete.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">I was especially worried that I would not be able to keep my promise - to update the chapters immediately when the climax came, and broadcast them all at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Fortunately, after trying my best, I finally did it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">It can be regarded as an explanation to everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Thank you all for your support all along! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">The layout and structure of the first volume are actually quite complex. It is divided into three levels for expression. In the early stage, Ning Zhuo's appearance and the action of blowing up the Immortal Palace are the first level. In the middle stage, Sun Lingtong, Qi Bai, and Yuan Dasheng are the second level. In the late stage, the Immortal Palace Examination and the climax of Ning Zhuo's seizure of the Immortal Palace are the third level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Just like a three-layer cake, each layer has its own unique flavor. When you eat the lower layer, you will recall the upper layer and easily find that the upper layer has another flavor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Obviously, only after eating the third layer can one have a truly comprehensive understanding of the first volume, and understand Ning Zhuo's "good at hiding his shortcomings"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">A concept, a new understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">This is a new attempt of mine - to express the character's temperament through the outline structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">There are also a lot of characters in the first volume. The plot is developed through the interaction and influence of the characters, which constantly generate new events, and then affect other people, which in turn generate new events, and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">The first volume features two very important puppet shows, "Qin Lie Goes to the Battlefield" and "Fang Qing's Reparation", both of which are carefully designed plays within plays. The final climax is another puppet show set in the Lava Fairy Palace. The people who manipulate the plays are the Three Sect Masters and the Southern Dou Supreme Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The symbolic tools reflected Ning's growth in ability and character. In the end, everything came together, like a bird taking flight, achieving its purpose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Oh, right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The final poems of the Three Sect Masters are a complete piece, divided into an upper, middle, and lower part. These, as you may have noticed, carry significant meaning. Most loose ends were tied up, with only a few left unresolved for the epilogue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At present, there’s still a huge logic flaw — a bug that I couldn’t quite iron out, and it left me with a bit of a headache. What worries me most is that this bug may ruin the enjoyment of the final grand climax. I only hope that readers will just look past it and focus on the reading experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ah, the complexity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">There are too many characters, and I have to consider each person's personality, beliefs, ideologies, and the differences in the information they possess. It’s a challenge to rationally weave all of this into the plot. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Balancing foreshadowing, clues, and fine details cost me a great deal of brainpower, time, and energy. By the time I reached the middle and later parts, my exhaustion was through the roof.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">I believe some readers can see that this is a similar structure to the first volume of "Infinite Blood Core", but "Mysteries of the Immortal Puppet Master" has more characters and more layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">This kind of writing is very thankless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">When I was working on Infinite Bloodcore, it felt like a filler compared to Mysteries of the Immortal Puppet Master, where the complexity was overwhelming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">But mainly, it’s all about writing habits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Once habits are formed, changing them becomes as easy as flipping a switch. But it’s hard to go back. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">What I really want is to improve everyone’s reading experience!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">I can't let you all read while suffering—this is unacceptable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The first volume is already like a steel plate, unchangeable. Each character, each plotline, every foreshadowing is intertwined like gears meshing together. Moving one piece would trigger a chain reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Those of you who read through the first volume may better understand the helplessness I felt. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Of course, if I really want to change, it is not impossible to improve. Looking back now, there is still room for improvement. The main reason is that my personal energy has been squeezed to the limit. The same is true for willpower, which has been exhausted for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">So, this is one of the main focuses of the second volume.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Thank you all for your continued support!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Thank you all for your monthly tickets!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">Thank you all for your support! During the time when I was being scolded, every bit of support and trust was like warm charcoal in the cold snow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Thanks for the criticism too!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">Many of the criticisms are reasonable, and have basically been collected by my colleagues in the operations team and summarized here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Therefore, in the second volume, I will try my best to improve!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">But for now, my personal ability has reached its peak, and the process of improvement may not be effective and immediate. I must explain this to all book lovers in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">During the improvement process, the daily update volume may decline. But I will at least guarantee 4,000 words of updates per day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Currently, from my personal perspective, the climax at the end of the first volume is unfolding as expected. But</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">please don’t expect every volume to end in a perfect climax, as there could be unforeseen circumstances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The second volume’s climax, in my opinion, will be even more intense than the first volume! Preparations are already underway for a visual report of the second volume’s climax, which will be illustrated and very exciting to see!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Finally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Please look forward to The Second Volume of "Mysteries of the Immortal Puppet Master"——</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">The cloud whale, which has reached the end of its life, wails as it dives into the sea; the dragon god of the Cangjiang River falls into a sleepy sleep. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The flying cloud thieves, driving their mechanical flying boats, gathered and passed by.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Is the prophecy of the Wanxiang Sect about to come true?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo: "Mom, I'll take you home!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
