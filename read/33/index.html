<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 33: Soul Returns</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The entire Lava Immortal Palace was shaking violently!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo’s palm were placed on the five-sided stone pillar, and his soul power was being consumed at a terrifying rate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Right now, his soul was outside his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">His body was still in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, but his soul was inside the Lava Immortal Palace. His body and soul were connected only by the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo was a mere Qi Refining stage cultivator, but the Buddha Heart Demon Seal was a magic treasure. It was difficult for him to activate the treasure seal even in the best of circumstances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">And now, his body and soul were separated, and he had to guide the seal’s power through the Life-Hanging Thread. Using the Buddha Heart Demon Seal like this was more than ten times harder than usual!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo’s spirit power and soul power both plummeted precipitously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He looked up at the stone pillar and was pleasantly surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">That was because he saw that his name was slowly sinking. At this rate, once his name sank to the point of being level with the pillar’s surface, his identity would be successfully concealed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">However, when it made it halfway into the pillar, his name suddenly stopped moving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo’s puppet body fell to its knees in front of the stone pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">His soul power was almost exhausted, leaving his soul on the brink of dispersing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo couldn’t hold on any longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">For him to activate the seal’s power was like a baby wielding a giant hammer. His small body was unable to bear it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The next moment, his soul reached its limit. It quickly left his puppet body, flying along the Life-Hanging Thread and penetrating space to return to his true body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Thump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Without a soul, the puppet body fell motionless on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">As for Ning Zhuo, he fainted once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was flying around in the air. Wherever it went, it left terrifying flames raging in its wake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Suddenly, it stopped in place, having noticed the departure of Ning Zhuo’s soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">It opened its mouth and let out a loud roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Its roar penetrated the Lava Immortal Palace and spread into the surroundings, clearing the heavy clouds and smoke and stirring the churning lava wherever it went.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit is roaring? What’s got it going so crazy?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Fire Persimmon City Lord had no choice but to urgently activate Fire Persimmon Immortal City’s grand formation once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Countless green formation patterns covered heaven and earth, crisscrossing in a great net and forming a powerful blockade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Fire Persimmon City Lord’s beard fluttered and his eyes reddened, his clothes billowing without wind as he fought to suppress the wild Lava Immortal Palace. It wasn’t until half an incense stick’s worth of time passed that the situation gradually became stable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Last time, the immortal palace almost flew into the sky after being attacked by the Golden Core demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“What happened this time? Was it attacked again?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Fire Persimmon City Lord’s eyes narrowed, and his expression turned gloomy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ever since the immortal palace emerged from the volcano, he had been sitting high above in the clouds and never left for a single moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He was a dignified Nascent Soul cultivator and the master of this area. Which overconfident fool would dare to sneak into the Lava Immortal Palace under his watch?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Since he stationed himself above the mountain, no outsider had entered the immortal palace. Of this, he was certain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Even if someone sneaked in from below the volcano, they would have to contend with the grand formation’s detection, as well as the endless lava surges that have yet to subside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Is it just that the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit is feeling impatient?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo slowly woke up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">After a long time passed, his blurry vision gradually turned clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His eyelids felt extremely heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“The damage to my soul this time is much more serious than my last trip.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo resisted the urge to fall back asleep, instead laboriously raising his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Even though he deliberately moved slowly, waves of dizziness struck him one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Eventually, he sat up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This simple action left his back covered in a cold sweat. Light and shadow overlapped in his vision, and the stationary tables, chairs, and benches seemed to be trembling visibly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He had no choice but to close his eyes, submerging himself in darkness. His heartbeat, much faster than normal, started to sound like a violent drumbeat to his ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">A long time passed. He slowly opened his eyes, feeling just a bit better than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“My body and soul are originally one. They perfectly suit each other.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The body naturally nourished the soul. This was why Ning Zhuo could recover slightly even without doing anything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">But the speed of this natural recovery was too slow. If he wanted to save on time, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to take medicine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He slowly left his bed and stood on his feet. Then, he twisted the mechanism to open the basement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">On the way down, he held onto anything and everything for support, and moved at a snail-like pace. If he moved any faster, he might directly fall unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Halfway down, he couldn’t handle it any longer and slowly crouched down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Curling up into a ball, he leaned his head against the handrail of the stairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo felt very uncomfortable. He was full of a sense of weakness and heaviness, his head felt like it was spinning, and he had a powerful urge to vomit. But more than all this, he felt extremely, extremely sleepy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Lowering his head, he felt as if his skull had magnified several times and his spine was as weak as a withered branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He closed his eyes again. In the darkness, he listened quietly to his drum-like heartbeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">His back was hunched, as if there was an invisible mountain pressing down on him, crushing him beneath its weight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Hehe.” Ning Zhuo chuckled through his pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The more complicated a mechanical construct was, the more he desired to study it thoroughly. The more difficult a situation he was in, the more it stimulated the fighting spirit that was usually hidden deep in his bones!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His face was as pale as a sheet of paper and his forehead was covered in cold sweat, but the corners of his mouth were slightly raised in a madman’s smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Soon, he restrained his emotions, and his smile disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He opened his eyes again, pupils full of resolute coldness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“It’s possible!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Thanks to the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, I can continue hiding my identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“This is what my mother left behind for me, and it’s also my only opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“If I can’t catch hold of this opportunity, I’ll be ashamed to face my mother!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo laboriously stood up again. Each and every tiny movement required his fullest effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After walking down the stairs, he leaned against the wall to walk over to his medicine cabinet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Resisting his dizziness, he opened the cabinet door with his trembling hands and pulled out a pill bottle, popping open the cork with extreme difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He was losing feeling in his hands and feet, and his vision was filled with spots, so many pills spilled on the ground as he poured them out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">But in the end, he managed to swallow one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">After successfully taking a pill, Ning Zhuo slumped against the wall and slowly sat down. His head lolled as he directly fell asleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">By the time he woke up again, it was already late at night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">His condition had improved dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Before, he had been seeing double, and his world would spin every time he moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But now, his sight was just a little blurry. Double vision would only occur if he turned his head too fast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Relying on pills was much more effective than sleeping. If it wasn’t, how could alchemy rank at the top of the hundred arts of cultivation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo picked up the pills that had spilled on the ground, cleaned them off, and put them back into the pill bottle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He didn’t have many left, so he had to use them as frugally as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“I need to stockpile pills that can nourish the soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Having your soul enter the palace is very taxing. The demand for these kinds of pills will only become higher and higher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“And they’re even more crucial for me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Even if I buy a lot of soul-nourishing pills, I can’t bring them into the Lava Immortal Palace. Once I’m there, I’m on my own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“I have to raise the strength of my soul itself, and it has to be at least twice as strong as now. Otherwise, I won’t be able to erase my name from the ranking.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
