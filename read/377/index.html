<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo continued, "The reason I didnâ€™t accept those enlightenment diagrams is because they werenâ€™t given as a gift from a friend."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"They were meant as an apology, and yes, they were somewhat helpful to me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"But as far as my own temperament is concerned, I donâ€™t care for such things."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Hehe, with my talent, my background, and my abilities, itâ€™s only a matter of time before I can get any enlightenment diagram I want, so why bother?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"I understand why your senior brothers misinterpreted my intentions to defend Junior Sister Lin. But understanding doesnâ€™t mean I forgive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"I will handle this matter in my own way!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Upon hearing Ning Zhuo's words, Xiao Ju panicked and tried to calm things down, urging him to let the matter go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo smiled and retrieved several pieces of evidence from his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"These are the findings from my investigation todayâ€”evidence that your senior brothers conspired to spread rumors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Xiao Ju, please pass these on to Linghu Jiu. If Miss Lin was aware of this, make sure she sees it too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Xiao Ju turned pale; she hadnâ€™t realized Ning Zhuo had already uncovered the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"As expected of someone from a noble family, trained from a young age. In this regard, Ning Zhuo is just like Miss Lin!" she thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">As just a servant, Xiao Ju couldn't make any decisions on her own. In the end, under Ning Zhuoâ€™s escort, she left Little Contention Peak with the diagrams and the incriminating evidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Interesting, very interesting," Ning Zhuo mused, pacing around in his cave, finding the situation increasingly amusing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon coiled at his waist, Sun Lingtong sent a message: "Little Zhuo, those pieces of evidence, I went through great effort to gather them, and you just handed them over like that? You wonâ€™t even blackmail them a bit?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"And those Fire and Metal element enlightenment diagrams? Why didnâ€™t you take them? They were practically served to us on a silver platter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"You may not want to study them, but I do!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly without responding, and instead asked, "Boss, what do you think of Linghu Jiu?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sun Lingtong immediately replied, "According to our intel, heâ€™s the senior brother of Myriad Medicine Sect, extremely talented, famous for his love of drinking, and highly regarded in the sect! But he's reckless, often punished by Lin Bufan, and currently imprisoned in the Wan Yao Cave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo nodded. "Boss, have you ever looked into what kind of mistakes Linghu Jiu keeps making that result in his constant punishments?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sun Lingtong thought for a moment. "Eh, they're all minor things, but since he's the senior brother, his position demands exemplary conduct. Lin Bufan's punishments make sense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo responded, "Linghu Jiu may be frequently punished, but his reputation in the Myriad Medicine Sect remains unshaken."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Even Lin Shanshan instinctively turns to Linghu Jiu for help whenever sheâ€™s in trouble, just like this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"I think that in addition to Lin Shanshan others like Lao De and his group probably view Linghu Jiu in the same way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Based on my initial analysis, I thought Linghu Jiu was just a carefree wanderer. But now, I see itâ€™s not that simple!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Think about itâ€”right after we got the evidence, this happened."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"If he knew we had it, that means he has a very clear understanding of whatâ€™s going on outside the cave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"If he didnâ€™t know and only just learned it from Xiao Ju, deducing everything and making amends so quickly shows a deep understanding of people and sect politics."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">At this point, Ning Zhuo answered Sun Lingtongâ€™s earlier question, "Whether or not I accepted those enlightenment diagrams, the power of the evidence in our hands has already plummeted. This card is half-useless now, and if we donâ€™t play it now, we wonâ€™t have a chance to later."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"If we use it now, we might still gain something from it in the future!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Sun Lingtong understood, "I see now! You and Linghu Jiu have already crossed swords, indirectly, over this issue!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Thatâ€™s right," Ning Zhuo nodded, "What a shame. If I had known back at Great Contention Peak, I would have 'accidentally' stumbled into Wan Yao Cave to meet Linghu Jiu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"But back then, our target was Lin Shanshan, and I didn't want to cause unnecessary complications."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Now that I understand the situation, barging into Wan Yao Cave would be disrespectful to the entire Myriad Medicine Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"I really want to meet Linghu Jiu one day."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Just as Linghu Jiu had longed to meet Ning Zhuo, now Ning Zhuo had developed a deep interest in meeting Linghu Jiu as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun Lingtong reminded him, "Little Zhuo, focus on the present first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Without Fire and Metal element techniques, how are you planning to handle Hua Guzi?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo smiled, "Boss, donâ€™t worry. I have a plan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuoâ€™s refusal to accept the enlightenment diagrams surprised Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">When Lin Shanshan heard about it, she was unexpectedly relieved, much to Xiao Juâ€™s surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Lin Shanshan explained, "I know Ning Zhuo's character. Since he declined them, he must be confident. Iâ€™m actually looking forward to seeing him defeat Hua Guzi!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">This battle was a private duel, not part of a public competition, but many cultivators were eagerly anticipating it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The battle occurred as scheduled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">At Little Contention Peak, in the martial arena!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Hua Guzi, with her petite and delicate figure, stood only four and a half feet tall. She had short hair, dark at the top with a hint of purple at the tips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Her round face had a slight baby fat, and her skin was pale and smooth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Her eyes shimmered with a strange purple light, and it was said she was a half-human, half-demon hybrid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Her nose was small and sharp, and her lips were a soft pink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">She wore a red and white dress and was barefoot, always floating in the air, rarely touching the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Ning Zhuo, just because you look good doesnâ€™t mean you can be so arrogant!" Hua Guzi shouted as soon as she spoke. "Today, Iâ€™ll teach you a lesson!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo smiled, "Friend Hua, you look quite good yourself, even more so than I do. So by your own logic, itâ€™s you who should be taught a lesson, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Hua Guzi froze, stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Huh?" After a moment, she blinked rapidly. "You speak so well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Hehe, youâ€™re so good at flattering girls. Now Iâ€™m even more excited!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Iâ€™ll tear that sweet mouth of yours apart!!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">With that, she cast a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Tree World Descends!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A powerful Wood element technique was unleashed instantly. Towering trees shot up from the ground, completely surrounding Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Next, countless vines and roots slithered toward Ning Zhuo like serpents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Just as Ning Zhuo was about to cast a defensive spell, he suddenly hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Fake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"This has to be fake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Realizing this, he gritted his teeth and chose not to defend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The duel had an appointed referee, and since the referee hadn't announced the start of the battle, whoever attacked first would lose by default.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Sure enough, when the vines reached Ning Zhuo, they turned into transparent shadows and vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The towering forest of trees also disappeared from his view.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">His vision cleared again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Hua Guzi was still floating in place, having never moved at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Ku-ku-ku..." She giggled, covering her mouth with a laugh that sounded like a cooing pigeonâ€”strange and eerie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The surrounding spectators burst into laughter, seeing Ning Zhuo preparing for defense against an illusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Illusion! Little Zhuo, you fell right into her illusion," Sun Lingtong laughed gleefully from the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo, without the same acute senses as Sun Lingtong, had fallen for it instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Seeing Ning Zhuo caught off guard, Sun Lingtong couldnâ€™t help but enjoy his misfortune, as if reminiscing about the days when he used to train Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuoâ€™s expression turned serious. "Friend Huaâ€™s illusion is even trickier than I expected. Iâ€™ve learned my lesson!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Hua Guziâ€™s eyes glinted with a sickly, cruel gleam. "Donâ€™t worry, Young Master, just this much isnâ€™t enough. Iâ€™ll make sure you get a real taste of me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The battle officially began!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Wood Elementâ€”Root Binding!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Wood Elementâ€”Floral Maze!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo launched an attack at the first opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Vines erupted from the ground like crocodiles leaping from water, lunging to ensnare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">But they struck nothing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Hua Guziâ€™s form vanished, leaving only a trail of flower petals and fragrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"I canâ€™t see her!" Ning Zhuoâ€™s detection spells found nothing, putting him in a difficult spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He unleashed floating mechanical hands, casting various elemental spells in all directions, bombarding the area wildly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">If Hua Guzi tried to approach, she might be exposed to the attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Though his offensive appeared aggressive, Ning Zhuo knew he was on the defensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Aware of the real situation, he focused on controlling the floating hands while secretly preparing to cast Tree World Descends.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Surprisingly, Hua Guzi didnâ€™t show herself during this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Wood Elementâ€”Tree World Descends!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The scene from Ning Zhuoâ€™s earlier illusion manifested again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">A dense forest of trees sprang up, covering the entire battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Countless vines and roots swung wildly, attempting to sweep out Hua Guzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">But Hua Guzi appeared voluntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">She floated high above, above even the treetops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">As soon as she appeared, the vines surged toward her like a flood of serpents, an intimidating force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Hua Guzi remained calm and smiled triumphantly, "I was waiting for this move!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Wood Elementâ€”Deadly Blossom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Suddenly, the vines and roots sprouted countless buds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Within a single breath, they swelled in size, and with the next breath, they all bloomed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The vines and roots lost their power, withering in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The flowers detached from the vines and scattered through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Wood Elementâ€”Withering Blossom Rain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Like a torrential downpour, the petals rained down, covering the entire forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The towering ancient trees withered and collapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">More and more buds sprouted on the trees, sapping their power and life force, blooming into flowers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Hua Guzi laughed proudly, "You dare to fight me with Wood element techniques? In that domain, I'm your master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
