<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo continued, "The reason I didn‚Äôt accept those enlightenment diagrams is because they weren‚Äôt given as a gift from a friend."<br/>
<br/>
"They were meant as an apology, and yes, they were somewhat helpful to me!"<br/>
<br/>
"But as far as my own temperament is concerned, I don‚Äôt care for such things."<br/>
<br/>
"Hehe, with my talent, my background, and my abilities, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before I can get any enlightenment diagram I want, so why bother?"<br/>
<br/>
"I understand why your senior brothers misinterpreted my intentions to defend Junior Sister Lin. But understanding doesn‚Äôt mean I forgive."<br/>
<br/>
"I will handle this matter in my own way!"<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing Ning Zhuo's words, Xiao Ju panicked and tried to calm things down, urging him to let the matter go.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled and retrieved several pieces of evidence from his storage belt.<br/>
<br/>
"These are the findings from my investigation today‚Äîevidence that your senior brothers conspired to spread rumors."<br/>
<br/>
"Xiao Ju, please pass these on to Linghu Jiu. If Miss Lin was aware of this, make sure she sees it too."<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju turned pale; she hadn‚Äôt realized Ning Zhuo had already uncovered the truth.<br/>
<br/>
"As expected of someone from a noble family, trained from a young age. In this regard, Ning Zhuo is just like Miss Lin!" she thought.<br/>
<br/>
As just a servant, Xiao Ju couldn't make any decisions on her own. In the end, under Ning Zhuo‚Äôs escort, she left Little Contention Peak with the diagrams and the incriminating evidence.<br/>
<br/>
"Interesting, very interesting," Ning Zhuo mused, pacing around in his cave, finding the situation increasingly amusing.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon coiled at his waist, Sun Lingtong sent a message: "Little Zhuo, those pieces of evidence, I went through great effort to gather them, and you just handed them over like that? You won‚Äôt even blackmail them a bit?"<br/>
<br/>
"And those Fire and Metal element enlightenment diagrams? Why didn‚Äôt you take them? They were practically served to us on a silver platter."<br/>
<br/>
"You may not want to study them, but I do!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly without responding, and instead asked, "Boss, what do you think of Linghu Jiu?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong immediately replied, "According to our intel, he‚Äôs the senior brother of Myriad Medicine Sect, extremely talented, famous for his love of drinking, and highly regarded in the sect! But he's reckless, often punished by Lin Bufan, and currently imprisoned in the Wan Yao Cave."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. "Boss, have you ever looked into what kind of mistakes Linghu Jiu keeps making that result in his constant punishments?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong thought for a moment. "Eh, they're all minor things, but since he's the senior brother, his position demands exemplary conduct. Lin Bufan's punishments make sense."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo responded, "Linghu Jiu may be frequently punished, but his reputation in the Myriad Medicine Sect remains unshaken."<br/>
<br/>
"Even Lin Shanshan instinctively turns to Linghu Jiu for help whenever she‚Äôs in trouble, just like this time."<br/>
<br/>
"I think that in addition to Lin Shanshan others like Lao De and his group probably view Linghu Jiu in the same way."<br/>
<br/>
"Based on my initial analysis, I thought Linghu Jiu was just a carefree wanderer. But now, I see it‚Äôs not that simple!"<br/>
<br/>
"Think about it‚Äîright after we got the evidence, this happened."<br/>
<br/>
"If he knew we had it, that means he has a very clear understanding of what‚Äôs going on outside the cave."<br/>
<br/>
"If he didn‚Äôt know and only just learned it from Xiao Ju, deducing everything and making amends so quickly shows a deep understanding of people and sect politics."<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Ning Zhuo answered Sun Lingtong‚Äôs earlier question, "Whether or not I accepted those enlightenment diagrams, the power of the evidence in our hands has already plummeted. This card is half-useless now, and if we don‚Äôt play it now, we won‚Äôt have a chance to later."<br/>
<br/>
"If we use it now, we might still gain something from it in the future!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong understood, "I see now! You and Linghu Jiu have already crossed swords, indirectly, over this issue!"<br/>
<br/>
"That‚Äôs right," Ning Zhuo nodded, "What a shame. If I had known back at Great Contention Peak, I would have 'accidentally' stumbled into Wan Yao Cave to meet Linghu Jiu."<br/>
<br/>
"But back then, our target was Lin Shanshan, and I didn't want to cause unnecessary complications."<br/>
<br/>
"Now that I understand the situation, barging into Wan Yao Cave would be disrespectful to the entire Myriad Medicine Sect."<br/>
<br/>
"I really want to meet Linghu Jiu one day."<br/>
<br/>
Just as Linghu Jiu had longed to meet Ning Zhuo, now Ning Zhuo had developed a deep interest in meeting Linghu Jiu as well.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong reminded him, "Little Zhuo, focus on the present first."<br/>
<br/>
"Without Fire and Metal element techniques, how are you planning to handle Hua Guzi?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled, "Boss, don‚Äôt worry. I have a plan!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs refusal to accept the enlightenment diagrams surprised Linghu Jiu.<br/>
<br/>
When Lin Shanshan heard about it, she was unexpectedly relieved, much to Xiao Ju‚Äôs surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan explained, "I know Ning Zhuo's character. Since he declined them, he must be confident. I‚Äôm actually looking forward to seeing him defeat Hua Guzi!"<br/>
<br/>
This battle was a private duel, not part of a public competition, but many cultivators were eagerly anticipating it.<br/>
<br/>
The battle occurred as scheduled.<br/>
<br/>
At Little Contention Peak, in the martial arena!<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi, with her petite and delicate figure, stood only four and a half feet tall. She had short hair, dark at the top with a hint of purple at the tips.<br/>
<br/>
Her round face had a slight baby fat, and her skin was pale and smooth.<br/>
<br/>
Her eyes shimmered with a strange purple light, and it was said she was a half-human, half-demon hybrid.<br/>
<br/>
Her nose was small and sharp, and her lips were a soft pink.<br/>
<br/>
She wore a red and white dress and was barefoot, always floating in the air, rarely touching the ground.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, just because you look good doesn‚Äôt mean you can be so arrogant!" Hua Guzi shouted as soon as she spoke. "Today, I‚Äôll teach you a lesson!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled, "Friend Hua, you look quite good yourself, even more so than I do. So by your own logic, it‚Äôs you who should be taught a lesson, right?"<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi froze, stunned.<br/>
<br/>
"Huh?" After a moment, she blinked rapidly. "You speak so well."<br/>
<br/>
"Hehe, you‚Äôre so good at flattering girls. Now I‚Äôm even more excited!"<br/>
<br/>
"I‚Äôll tear that sweet mouth of yours apart!!!"<br/>
<br/>
With that, she cast a spell.<br/>
<br/>
Tree World Descends!<br/>
<br/>
A powerful Wood element technique was unleashed instantly. Towering trees shot up from the ground, completely surrounding Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Next, countless vines and roots slithered toward Ning Zhuo like serpents.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Ning Zhuo was about to cast a defensive spell, he suddenly hesitated.<br/>
<br/>
"Fake!"<br/>
<br/>
"This has to be fake!"<br/>
<br/>
Realizing this, he gritted his teeth and chose not to defend.<br/>
<br/>
The duel had an appointed referee, and since the referee hadn't announced the start of the battle, whoever attacked first would lose by default.<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, when the vines reached Ning Zhuo, they turned into transparent shadows and vanished.<br/>
<br/>
The towering forest of trees also disappeared from his view.<br/>
<br/>
His vision cleared again.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi was still floating in place, having never moved at all.<br/>
<br/>
"Ku-ku-ku..." She giggled, covering her mouth with a laugh that sounded like a cooing pigeon‚Äîstrange and eerie.<br/>
<br/>
The surrounding spectators burst into laughter, seeing Ning Zhuo preparing for defense against an illusion.<br/>
<br/>
"Illusion! Little Zhuo, you fell right into her illusion," Sun Lingtong laughed gleefully from the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, without the same acute senses as Sun Lingtong, had fallen for it instantly.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo caught off guard, Sun Lingtong couldn‚Äôt help but enjoy his misfortune, as if reminiscing about the days when he used to train Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs expression turned serious. "Friend Hua‚Äôs illusion is even trickier than I expected. I‚Äôve learned my lesson!"<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi‚Äôs eyes glinted with a sickly, cruel gleam. "Don‚Äôt worry, Young Master, just this much isn‚Äôt enough. I‚Äôll make sure you get a real taste of me."<br/>
<br/>
The battle officially began!<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element‚ÄîRoot Binding!<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element‚ÄîFloral Maze!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo launched an attack at the first opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Vines erupted from the ground like crocodiles leaping from water, lunging to ensnare.<br/>
<br/>
But they struck nothing!<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi‚Äôs form vanished, leaving only a trail of flower petals and fragrance.<br/>
<br/>
"I can‚Äôt see her!" Ning Zhuo‚Äôs detection spells found nothing, putting him in a difficult spot.<br/>
<br/>
He unleashed floating mechanical hands, casting various elemental spells in all directions, bombarding the area wildly.<br/>
<br/>
If Hua Guzi tried to approach, she might be exposed to the attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Though his offensive appeared aggressive, Ning Zhuo knew he was on the defensive.<br/>
<br/>
Aware of the real situation, he focused on controlling the floating hands while secretly preparing to cast Tree World Descends.<br/>
<br/>
Surprisingly, Hua Guzi didn‚Äôt show herself during this time.<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element‚ÄîTree World Descends!<br/>
<br/>
The scene from Ning Zhuo‚Äôs earlier illusion manifested again.<br/>
<br/>
A dense forest of trees sprang up, covering the entire battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Countless vines and roots swung wildly, attempting to sweep out Hua Guzi.<br/>
<br/>
But Hua Guzi appeared voluntarily.<br/>
<br/>
She floated high above, above even the treetops.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as she appeared, the vines surged toward her like a flood of serpents, an intimidating force.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi remained calm and smiled triumphantly, "I was waiting for this move!"<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element‚ÄîDeadly Blossom!<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the vines and roots sprouted countless buds.<br/>
<br/>
Within a single breath, they swelled in size, and with the next breath, they all bloomed.<br/>
<br/>
The vines and roots lost their power, withering in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
The flowers detached from the vines and scattered through the air.<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element‚ÄîWithering Blossom Rain.<br/>
<br/>
Like a torrential downpour, the petals rained down, covering the entire forest.<br/>
<br/>
The towering ancient trees withered and collapsed.<br/>
<br/>
More and more buds sprouted on the trees, sapping their power and life force, blooming into flowers.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi laughed proudly, "You dare to fight me with Wood element techniques? In that domain, I'm your master!"<br/>
