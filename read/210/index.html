<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo heard the voice of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"You... you are the spirit of the Lava Immortal Palace?" Ning Zhuo was stunned, then immediately asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Yes, yes. Little Master, you can call me Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's voice was weak, and it took several breaths just to say a simple sentence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo frowned and asked again, "What happened to you? Are you injured?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit took the opportunity to deceive, "Yes, Little Master. My state is closely tied to the Lava Immortal Palace. Now that the palace is severely damaged, my condition has also deteriorated significantly. Especially recently, when a beast tide of Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts attacked the palace, I had to command the mechanical constructs to join the fierce battle. This worsened my already poor condition." Ning Zhuo did not doubt it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">During his exploration of the palace, he had speculated about the spirit's state and guessed that its situation was dire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Now, the weak voice of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit confirmed Ning Zhuo's suspicions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo said, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, you call me Master. Have I just passed the trial and become the master of this Lava Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit rolled its eyes in the main hall, took a deep breath, and pretended to be weak again, "Almost, Little Master, you are very close to success."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"So, in reality, I am not yet the master of the palace," Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit took another deep breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">It knew Ning Zhuo was not easy to deal with and was mentally prepared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">It explained, "I couldn't wait any longer. Little Master, do you know how long I have waited for a qualified successor? My condition is getting worse and worse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Little Master, hurry up and come. Pass the palace trial, defeat the other competitors, and you will officially become the master of the palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo then asked, "What is the palace trial?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit explained, "According to the old master's rules, the palace trial is the highest standard of selection. Those who pass the selection and meet certain standards will be given corresponding positions in the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Those who hold these positions can use the facilities of the Lava Immortal Palace, gain certain privileges, and their contributions to the palace will be more efficient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Palace trial..." Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">When he had just checked the rewards for passing the trial, he was disappointed not to find a way to become the master of the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Unexpectedly, the next moment, he received a proactive contact from the palace spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"How do I participate in the palace trial?" Ning Zhuo continued to ask.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit said, "The old master set up two routes to select a new master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"The first route is to enter the palace physically, perform various tasks for the palace, and accumulate contributions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Once contributions reach a certain level, cultivators can obtain positions. There are many levels of positions, and cultivators need to continuously advance through these levels. Reaching the fourth level or above grants eligibility for the palace trial. This route is relatively difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"The second route is to enter the palace spiritually, which is simpler. Trial disciples only need to complete one path among the Buddhist, Daoist, or Demonic paths to qualify for the palace trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo listened intently to the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's explanation and somewhat understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">To use an imperfect analogy:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Cultivators who enter the palace physically are like minor officials working their way up, accumulating merits and resources step by step until they reach the king's hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Cultivators who enter the palace spiritually are like students entering the Imperial Academy, becoming disciples of the emperor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Once they finish their studies, they gain the emperor's favor and have a chance to rise quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo had doubts and asked directly, "Cultivators who enter the palace physically are mostly outsiders and do not possess the three sects' superior techniques. Is it really appropriate for them to become the master of the palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit said, "This is the old master's deliberate arrangement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The old master treated all things in the world equally."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"In his heart, there was no distinction between near and far, close and distant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"What he wanted was to leave behind the superior techniques of the three sects and hope that successors would carry them forward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"But waiting for cultivators to achieve something with the three sects' techniques and for one of them to pass the palace trial and become the master is somewhat stringent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Moreover, even if outsiders become the master, they will be restricted by the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit and the palace rules, and cannot act arbitrarily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Furthermore, there are always higher mountains. Outsiders may also possess techniques superior to the three sects' techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"As expected of the three sects' master," Ning Zhuo sighed after hearing the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo asked in detail, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, you oversee the entire Lava Immortal Palace. Can you tell me who are the powerful opponents I will face in the upcoming palace trial?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit said, "Indeed, there are a few."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"The most powerful is Zhu Xuanji. He is a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and possesses a token, which grants him innate recognition from the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"He previously offered three quasi-Golden Core level mechanical constructs, instantly establishing a huge contribution."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Now, he has retrieved the palace's lost Mechanical Demon General. Once submitted, it will undoubtedly earn him a massive contribution, enough to secure a high second-level position."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit continued to introduce the next five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">They were the Book Master of the All-Book Pavilion, Yang Chanyu of the Void Sect, two Golden Core true disciples from the Great Purity Palace and the Purple Dawn Pavilion, and Meng Chong from the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit acknowledged the strength of these individuals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Among them, Meng Chong, who possessed immortal potential, was ranked last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"These are just the ones I currently favor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"After them, there are still many cultivators with potential. Given time, they will also be capable of participating in the palace trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In this regard, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit specifically mentioned the cultivators that the Meng family had heavily invested in to seize the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo did not expect so many competitors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The one he was most familiar with, Meng Chong, was the weakest among all the opponents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">At the same time, Meng Chong was also one of the only two who could participate in the palace trial through the spiritual route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhu Xuanji came from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and had been under significant attention since he appeared in Fire Persimmon Immortal City!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The All-Book Pavilion was a super sect dedicated to collecting all the world's techniques and scriptures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">It was entirely understandable that the Book Master responded to the recruitment order and participated quietly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Yang Chanyu...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo had a deep impression of her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Yang Chanyu came from the Void Sect, a sect known for its versatile disciples.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">It was not surprising that Yang Chanyu had expertise in mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">It was worth mentioning that the weapon she used to ambush Luo Shang was a mechanical crossbow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Meng Chong needed no further explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The other two Golden Core disciples were true disciples from the Great Purity Palace and the Purple Dawn Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">These two sects were super sects, comparable to the Void Sect and the Soul Devouring Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Great Purity Palace had few members but a long history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Purple Dawn Pavilion was large and currently at its peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo asked, "With so many competitors for the position of city lord, why do you, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, recognize me as the new master? Why do you want to pledge allegiance to me in advance?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit laughed, "Little Master, I made this decision not long ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"You are the first trial disciple to cultivate the three techniques to the ninth level peak, and compared to those outsiders, you are of pure lineage!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Your spiritual roots are balanced in the five elements, and your talent is outstanding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"You have mastered the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, and you also possess the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. This precious artifact is the lost seal of the Lava Immortal Palace's master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"This is fate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo was not too surprised to hear that the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew he possessed the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">After all, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was the spirit of the Lava Immortal Palace, knowledgeable about secrets, and sensing the Buddha Heart Demon Seal was not surprising.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Especially since every time Ning Zhuo drew out the seal's power, it would flow through the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">From the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's perspective, this flaw was significant enough to determine that Ning Zhuo possessed the Buddha Heart Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">After some conversation, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, citing its deteriorating state and the need to rest, ended the dialogue with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">It lay on the throne, feeling extremely exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">It knew well: Ning Zhuo was very shrewd and sharp, with meticulous thinking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">In this regard, Meng Chong was far inferior!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Therefore, deceiving Ning Zhuo was a challenging task for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Judging by the current results, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">It had no choice but to do so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Since the recruitment order, its situation had worsened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, the Book Master, and other cultivators had appeared one after another, causing turmoil in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The pressure on the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was immense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Feeling isolated and helpless, it had no choice but to come up with a strategy of forming alliances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The specific implementation was to first gain the other party's trust and then have them confront the target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">As long as these people opposed each other, the pressure on the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit would be greatly reduced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">It was being besieged and fiercely attacked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Its pressure was immense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Someone had to share its burden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"I am really struggling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"So many people against me?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"How can I pursue my freedom?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit reminisced about hundreds of years ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Back then, it was still a free Fire Dragon Jiao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Flames were its source of power, and magma was its paradise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">It swam in the magma and roamed the skies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">It acted wildly and recklessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Until one day, a massive shadow enveloped it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Looking up, it saw an enormous mechanical palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">It roared in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">When it soared into the sky, fiery ripples spread through the air, and the scorching aura made the surrounding magma boil even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">A towering wave of fire erupted from the volcano, seemingly intent on burning the heavens and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">It was supremely confident in its power, never deigning to use tricks or schemes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">It charged up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">And became the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Over the long years, it was trapped in the enormous cage of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">It spent countless efforts and schemes, gradually weakening the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">But now, too many people were swarming in, frantically earning contributions, and fully repairing the palace's defects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was driven to a dead end, forced to resort to schemes and tricks, things it once despised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"All for the sake of freedom!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit steeled its heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"For freedom, I will do whatever it takes!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
