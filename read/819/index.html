<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Inside the dilapidated temple, Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an’s gazes shifted between the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator, the children, the villagers, and the heretical cultivator informant. Their brows were tightly locked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo took this scene in, already sensing that things were not good.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He knew a great deal of intelligence regarding these two before him: "Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an’s benevolence and kindness were interfering with their ability to make the correct decision."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"But clearly, the erosion of the blood mist will gradually deepen as time passes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Any hesitation, perhaps just wasting a few breaths of time, could ultimately lead to failure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Yun Niaoniao looked grave. "Talismans can only protect oneself, resisting the external blood mist erosion. Only medicinal pills and spiritual liquid can save the victims. Adding these three things together, it’s simply not enough to save everyone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Lu Xu’an sighed heavily. "We cannot fail to capture the Demon Seed host. If that scourge escapes, more living beings will inevitably suffer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He looked toward the heretical cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">From this perspective, the Golden Light Talisman should be given to the heretical cultivator in exchange for the key clue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">But there was a worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">That is - after satisfying the heretical cultivator’s demands, would he truly reveal the truth?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Before Ning Zhuo and the other two entered the dilapidated temple, among everyone inside, only the female cultivator and the heretical cultivator had not suffered from the blood mist’s encroachment. However, the blood mist outside the temple was heavy; relying solely on the personal strength of these two cultivators, it would be difficult to break through the blockade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In other words, the Golden Light Talisman was almost the only method of escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">If the heretical cultivator merely wanted to survive and pretended to know the Demon Seed host’s location, saying so deliberately, what then?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Lu Xu’an glanced at the heretical cultivator, then turned to look at the female cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">What he was thinking was: To verify the truth or falsehood of the heretical cultivator's words, we have to rely on the female cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But in the next moment, Lu Xu’an frowned again, recalling the female cultivator’s background. She had only joined halfway through - more accurately, she was a passing cultivator who got swept up in this and knew very little about the heretical cultivator’s situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Therefore, this cultivator from the Demon Subjugation Hall is the key!" Lu Xu’an fixed his gaze on the unconscious male cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"But to treat him, spiritual liquid certainly won't suffice; a complete medicinal pill must be used."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"And if this medicinal pill is used, the remaining few people sharing three small cups of spiritual liquid won't be enough to save their lives."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Could it be... we really have to abandon some of them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"This indeed is not a real scenario, just a trial," Yun Niaoniao suddenly murmured softly on the side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Both she and Lu Xu’an knew this was fake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Yet, they remained hesitant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">On one hand, acting from their true hearts, they wanted to do their utmost to save everyone, even in a fake scenario. On the other hand, they worried about the trial itself. What if there was a more 'correct' solution, and the Demon Subjugation Hall specifically wanted to test their decisiveness and wisdom when knowing they were in a simulated predicament?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Just as their thoughts were becoming cluttered and chaotic, Ning Zhuo suddenly spoke, "You two, I have thought of the correct solution."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an’s eyes immediately lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The former urged, "Fellow Daoist Ning, please speak quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo showed a hint of hesitation. "My method, however, requires you two to actively sacrifice yourselves for there to be a possibility of saving everyone present."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an were both stunned, then overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Lu Xu’an said, "Since there is such a good prescription, what harm is there in us sacrificing a little?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Yun Niaoniao did not hesitate at all. "I knew Fellow Daoist Ning would have a method. What should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Our spiritual energy has been sealed, making us no different from mortals." Ning Zhuo pointed to the female cultivator who was still struggling to maintain a calming spell. "But her spiritual energy remains. I will ask her to cast a spell to temporarily transfer the pressure of the blood mist erosion onto you two."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Lu Xu’an was startled. "Transfer?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Precisely," Ning Zhuo explained. "The three children are about to lose their minds because the blood mist is eroding their divine souls; the two villagers are about to undergo demonization because the blood mist has invaded their heart meridians. If we can draw out part of the blood mist from their bodies and have you two fellow Daoists share the burden, we can buy time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Yun Niaoniao suddenly understood. "This method is feasible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">She and Lu Xu’an had also passed the first two levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The harm of the blood mist had degrees of severity. In the first level, the Blood Village, some villagers could be saved precisely because the degree of encroachment was not deep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">And the second level, the Demon Seed, made Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an realize: even a Demon Seed can be extracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It was just that the three of them were strictly forbidden from using spiritual energy, spells, etc., reduced to "mortals." Among those present, the heretical cultivator was unreliable and untrustworthy, and was also sealed. Only the female cultivator could act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Lu Xu’an and Yun Niaoniao agreed without objection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Seeing the three come to an agreement, the female cultivator showed astonishment in her eyes. "This method is feasible, but extremely dangerous. Are you two really willing to risk your bodies? You must know there is only this much antidote. You two sharing the blood mist will indeed prolong things for a while, but the blood mist will self-propagate within your bodies. If too much time passes, you two will perish along with these people!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Lu Xu’an and Yun Niaoniao looked at each other and both said it was fine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">However, Lu Xu’an looked at Ning Zhuo, his gaze flickering slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo did not dodge but looked straight at Lu Xu’an. "You two bear a portion of the pressure first. I have other matters to perfect, and I will join in shortly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Lu Xu’an nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Yun Niaoniao chuckled lightly. "Then Niaoniao will witness with her own eyes how Fellow Daoist Ning brings back the dead and ingeniously solves this difficult problem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Everyone knew that Ning Zhuo could emit a Noble Spirit that pierced through the clouds. Lu Xu’an hesitated because he worried Ning Zhuo might use them to seize first place. Yun Niaoniao, however, didn't believe for a second that Ning Zhuo would do such a thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">If Ning Zhuo did that just for a trial, for victory in a fake level, what would become of his reputation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Moreover, in the Demon Subjugation Hall’s trials, the assessment standard was never superficial success or failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The female cultivator formed hand seals, chanting incantations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Pale green light flowed from her fingertips, turning into two ribbons of light connecting to Yun Niaoniao and Lu Xu’an’s chests respectively. Then, five thin threads branched out, connecting to the three children and the two villagers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The blood mist began to flow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Yun Niaoniao let out a muffled groan, feeling a sticky, fierce, and violent thought surge into her body along the light ribbon, giving her an intense urge to destroy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">She gritted her teeth and persisted, her body trembling slightly beneath her plain white dress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Veins popped out on Lu Xu’an’s forehead, yet he didn't make a sound, also struggling to resist the blood mist’s encroachment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">In contrast, the three children’s frenzy rapidly weakened. Their scratching at their skin stopped, and they curled up one after another, falling into a deep sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The bulging blood vessels on the chests of the two villagers also smoothed out significantly, and their breathing was no longer so rapid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The heretical cultivator widened his eyes, seemingly in disbelief. "There are actually such fools in this world? And two appeared at once?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Humph, this is the Righteous Path," Ning Zhuo sneered and began to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He took the emerald green medicinal pill and walked toward the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The pill emitted a faint, soft green light, and an aura of vitality permeated the air, making even the surrounding air somewhat fresher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo placed the pill into the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator's mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The medicinal effect was excellent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Moments later, the bleeding from the wound on the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator's chest stopped, and much color returned to his pale face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">His eyelashes trembled, and he slowly opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"I..." His voice was hoarse. "I'm still alive?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Fellow Daoist, do not move around." Ning Zhuo helped him sit half-upright. "The situation right now is this..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">After listening to Ning Zhuo’s brief explanation, the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator’s gaze immediately fell upon the heretical cultivator informant, anger flashing in his eyes. "You greedy coward!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The heretical cultivator sneered but did not reply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Seeing the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator’s strange attitude, Lu Xu’an and Yun Niaoniao felt their hearts stir, and the former asked a question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator then informed everyone: This heretical cultivator informant was someone he had developed. There had been an operation previously where the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator had almost succeeded, being only a hair's breadth away from sealing the Demon Seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">But at the critical moment, this heretical cultivator informant was greedy for life and afraid of death. He did not complete the promised cooperation, causing the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator’s efforts to fall short of success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Now, although the Demon Seed still had the residual power of the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator's seal, it had vanished without a trace. if they delayed any longer, the seal on the Demon Seed would completely fade, its demonic power would recover, and it would inevitably flee far away. The Demon Subjugation Hall’s years of effort would come to naught!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo asked the crucial question: Did the heretical cultivator informant before them really know the Demon Seed's location?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator nodded. "He does!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He then explained further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">It turned out that the heretical cultivator informant and the original owner of the Demon Seed host shared a blood relationship. To some extent, he was the most suitable heir for the blood mist Demon Seed host. A subtle resonance existed between the two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Yun Niaoniao revealed a look of shock. "So, if we give the Golden Light Talisman to this heretic, it is very likely he will actively find the Demon Seed and inherit it?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator shook his head. "That won't happen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Yun Niaoniao wondered, "Why is that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The heretical informant sneered. "You outsiders understand nothing! Do you think having a resonance between me and the Demon Seed host is a good thing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Of course not!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"I don't want to become the Demon Seed's host!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"That would cause me to gradually lose my sanity and eventually become nutrients for the Demon Seed! I want to live."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Otherwise, would I have become an informant for your Demon Subjugation Hall?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Ridiculous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I came to you to deal with the Demon Seed so I could survive. But for you to seal the Demon Seed, you needed me to take risks and fight to the death. If I wanted to risk my life, what would I need you for?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Yun Niaoniao showed evident disgust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Lu Xu’an said with disdain, "You are a cultivator, yet you have no sense of responsibility and are so greedy for life and afraid of death! Heaven granted you the aptitude for cultivation expecting a response from you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"As a result, because of a thought of stealing your life, you allowed the Demon Seed to escape and continue harming the common people. When you look back on this in the future, will you not be too ashamed to sleep?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The heretical cultivator shook his head with a cold smile. "I can't be bothered to argue with fools like you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He looked at Ning Zhuo. "Hey, since you know the situation now, why haven't you returned the talisman to me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"That was my thing to begin with. Give it back, let me go, and I'll tell you the approximate direction of the Demon Seed - that is my bottom line."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo, however, smiled and shook his head. "I strongly agree with what Fellow Daoist Lu Xu’an said. You have the body of a cultivator; you should be sharing the blood mist even more so."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">After speaking, he signaled the female cultivator to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The female cultivator hesitated and looked at the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivator. The latter hated the heretical cultivator to the bone and nodded decisively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The female cultivator immediately formed seals and cast the spell. A green light hit the heretical cultivator, linking him to the rest of the group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"No-!" the heretical cultivator screamed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The blood mist instantly surged into his body. He trembled violently, blood vessels bulging and pulsing under his skin, his eyes rapidly filling with blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Stop! Stop it quickly!" he roared hoarsely. "You can't do this! I am an important informant!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo remained expressionless. "You are greedy for life and afraid of death, you broke faith and abandoned righteousness, causing my fellow Daoist from the Demon Subjugation Hall to be heavily injured and letting the Demon Seed escape. Now you still want to negotiate terms?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He signaled the female cultivator: Increase the amount of blood mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Ahhh-!" A massive amount of blood mist poured into his body, causing the heretical cultivator to not only scream miserably but also twist and struggle physically. However, restricted by the seal, he couldn't break free at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He could only utter curses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo’s face was like iron, unmoved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The blood mist inside the heretical cultivator grew thicker and thicker, causing his screams to gradually turn into beast-like roars. His eyes turned completely blood-red, his sanity on the brink of collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Yun Niaoniao looked unbearable and turned her head away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Lu Xu’an pursed his lips tightly but did not speak up to stop it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Only then did Ning Zhuo raise his hand. "Stop."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">He took the pot of spiritual liquid, poured out a small cup, and walked up to the heretical cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The heretical cultivator’s consciousness was already blurry, his mouth emitting meaningless rasping sounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo poured the spiritual liquid into his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">As the clear liquid entered his throat, his whole body shook slightly. The blood color in his eyes receded a bit, restoring a shred of clarity. He gasped for large breaths of air, his body soaked in cold sweat, looking at Ning Zhuo with eyes full of terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Now," Ning Zhuo said indifferently, "are you willing to speak?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The heretical cultivator’s lips trembled. "You... you lunatic..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">But immediately, he reacted and let out a hideous laugh. "You can't scare me! Didn't you let me drink the spiritual liquid in the end? You want to know the Demon Seed's location? Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Fine!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"I want you to kneel down and beg me!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Such an arrogant attitude was met with Ning Zhuo’s sincere smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo turned to the female cultivator. "Do it again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The heretical cultivator: Urgh... Ahhh... Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Moments later, Ning Zhuo used the second cup of spiritual liquid to pull the heretical cultivator back from the edge of complete madness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The heretical cultivator trembled all over. "Don't, don't do this to me. I'll talk, I'll talk, okay?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">He panted heavily. "The Demon Seed... I can sense it. The Demon Seed host is in an ancient tomb three miles to the east; it's hiding right there."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Yun Niaoniao’s eyes lit up. "Really?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Lu Xu’an, however, quietly frowned. Because this response still couldn't prove whether the heretical cultivator was telling the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo stared at the heretical cultivator for a moment, then suddenly said, "Continue."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"What?!" The heretical cultivator was horrified. "I already told you! You still want to-"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Green light rose again, and the blood mist surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The heretical cultivator: Urgh... Ahhh... Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">This time, the degree of the heretical cultivator’s struggle clearly weakened significantly. In the end, he went limp on the ground, only his chest heaving weakly, the light in his eyes almost completely scattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Ning Zhuo poured out the third small cup of spiritual liquid and woke him up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo looked at him with a smile. "You know, you have already used our very last cup of spiritual liquid. If I go out this time and don't find the Demon Seed, what end do you think you will meet?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The heretical cultivator’s pupils contracted abruptly. He trembled all over, his last shred of luck completely dissipating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">He dared not gamble!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">He could only speak. "It... It's five miles to the west, there is a mountain spring. The Demon Seed host is hiding at the bottom of that mountain spring!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">After saying this, he collapsed from exhaustion and closed his eyes directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
