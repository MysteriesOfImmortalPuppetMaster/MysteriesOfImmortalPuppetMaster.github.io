<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>Ning Zhuo looked up, glancing at the towering mountain standing between heaven and earth, then looked at Sun Lingtong. Seeing the latter's indifferent attitude, he nodded to the village guard: "Then let's go back."<br/>
Although he only had Golden Core combat power, the Lava Immortal Palace incident had happened recently, and the various lessons he had learned were still vivid in his mind.<br/>
Ning Zhuo was cautious by nature.<br/>
Since others said the mountain was dangerous at night, he would follow their advice. What harm was there in spending a night in the mountain village?<br/>
"Honored guests, please come this way." The patrolling man smiled and took the lead.<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong followed him into the village.<br/>
Soon after, they met the village elder.<br/>
The village elder arranged for the two of them to stay in two guest rooms in the center of the mountain village. Ning Zhuo took out twenty pieces of spirit stones as payment. They also arranged to have tea with the village elder at night to discuss matters regarding Cloud Concealment Mountain.<br/>
The village elder accepted it naturally.<br/>
This was to be expected.<br/>
The patrolling man from earlier had changed his mind and invited Ning and Sun to stay in the village after seeing Ning Zhuo voluntarily give him a piece of spirit stone as a reward for giving directions.<br/>
"Honored guests, this is the special Cloud Concealment tea unique to Cloud Concealment Mountain. It can't compare to famous teas, but it has its own distinctive characteristics." The village elder offered hospitality.<br/>
Ning Zhuo picked up the teacup and saw that the tea leaves were deep green, but there was a layer of grayish-white tea down on the surface.<br/>
A fragrant aroma rose from the surface of the tea, lingering in the nostrils.<br/>
Upon entering the mouth, the tea was first bitter, entangling the tongue tip like mountain vines, but this bitterness passed in an instant, leaving behind a long-lasting sweet aftertaste, like the tranquility and freshness of the mountains after a thunderstorm.<br/>
"It has its own style, not bad," Ning Zhuo commented lightly.<br/>
On the other side, Sun Lingtong hadn't touched his cup.<br/>
On one hand, he had never had any elegant interest in tea drinking. For him, drinking tea only served the purpose of quenching thirst.<br/>
On the other hand, since Ning Zhuo had drunk it, he wouldn't. After all, they were traveling outside. This was one of the small tacit understandings between him and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
The three of them chatted while drinking tea.<br/>
Gradually, Ning and Sun gained a rough understanding of Cloud Concealment Mountain Village.<br/>
This mountain village had about 300 households, with approximately 1,500 people. The highest cultivation level in the village was Foundation Establishment, which was the cultivation level of the current village chief. There were six village elders, all of whom had Foundation Establishment cultivation at their peak. Some had been severely injured and their cultivation had fallen to the Qi Refining stage in their later years. But due to their seniority and merits, the villagers still respected them.<br/>
When talking about the village chief, Sun Lingtong asked where he was.<br/>
Logically, since Ning and Sun were Foundation Establishment cultivators, the village chief should’ve personally welcomed them.<br/>
But until now, the village chief hadn't appeared.<br/>
The village elder then told the two: The village chief had organized a group of people to deliver grain.<br/>
It turned out that about 800 miles away from Cloud Concealment Mountain, there was a Yujian Mountain.<br/>
This mountain was rich in Jade-infused Mystic Steel, and the Southern Bean Country had reopened mines there. It was heavily guarded. Over time, it had developed into a mountain town.<br/>
In recent years, the population in the mountain town had been increasing, but Yujian Mountain itself was poor in life force and couldn't be self-sufficient.<br/>
The Southern Bean Country officials had issued orders for the surrounding mountain villages to contribute people and resources, allocating excess supplies to be continually sent to the town at Yujian Mountain.<br/>
The mountain villages were willing to do so.<br/>
This was because sending supplies to Yujian Town allowed them to exchange for a large amount of money and goods there. It might not be a huge profit, but it could satisfy the developmental needs of the mountain village itself, which was a win-win situation.<br/>
As the night deepened, Ning Zhuo actively ended this tea talk.<br/>
After the village elder bid farewell, he and Sun Lingtong became invisible and intangible, leaping over walls to inspect the mountain village at night.<br/>
There were also patrol personnel near his lodging.<br/>
But how could these mountain villagers detect Ning and Sun? Sun Lingtong came from the Void Sect and was most skilled in thievery. Ning Zhuo possessed Cloud Concealment Technique, a strange and powerful technique that could even deceive Golden Core level cultivators, let alone these patrolling villagers.<br/>
Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo walked shoulder to shoulder, continuously leaping lightly on the rooftops of the village houses.<br/>
As the cool night breeze blew across their faces, Sun Lingtong transmitted: "Hehehe, how refreshing! Little Zhuo, this is the taste of freedom!"<br/>
He had long grown tired of staying in the Lava Immortal Palace. If it weren't for his concern for his master and then meeting Ning Zhuo later, given his personality, he would have long left and roamed freely in the world.<br/>
Ning Zhuo also had a smile on his face.<br/>
He had been in the Lava Immortal Palace since birth, and for fourteen years, he had been constantly scheming to obtain the Lava Immortal Fortune.<br/>
At this moment, with the matter of the Immortal Palace temporarily concluded, he had also put away the heavy burden on his mind, freely moving through the night breeze, feeling quite delighted.<br/>
The two found a high spot and suddenly stopped.<br/>
Sun Lingtong transmitted: "Little Zhuo, let's have a competition, how about testing our divine sense?" I won't take advantage of you, I'll also suppress my cultivation to early Foundation Establishment."<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "Big Brother, since you have such interest, how could I refuse?"<br/>
"Hehehe." Sun Lingtong laughed a few times, immediately spreading out his divine sense.<br/>
His divine sense continued to expand until it reached 260 zhang, then stopped.<br/>
His divine sense covered more than half of the village. After quietly investigating for a moment, he immediately withdrew his divine sense.<br/>
The speed of withdrawing his divine sense was astonishing, taking only three breaths to completely retract it.<br/>
More importantly, the entire process of spreading and retracting his divine sense was done without any leakage of aura, Cloud Concealment extremely well.<br/>
Even though Ning Zhuo was right next to Sun Lingtong, he couldn't sense any fluctuations at all.<br/>
It was Ning Zhuo's turn.<br/>
He slowly spread out his divine sense.<br/>
His divine sense expanded to 180 zhang before he could go no further and had to stop.<br/>
His divine sense covered just over half of the mountain village.<br/>
Many villagers were defenseless and unaware, allowing Ning Zhuo to see various arrangements inside the houses, as well as the villagers' nighttime activities.<br/>
He discovered that many villagers' homes enshrined mountain gods. The tablets, paintings, or small shrines of the mountain gods were 80% fox gods. Only 20% had tiger gods. And among this 20%, most also had fox gods. In other words, the tiger god as the official god was mostly just an accessory.<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully withdrew his divine sense.<br/>
His release of divine sense was several times slower than Sun Lingtong’s, and when retracting it, he was even slower, tens of times slower than Sun Lingtongs.<br/>
Sun Lingtong had been watching Ning Zhuo's performance and now slightly frowned.<br/>
"Little Zhuo, although our cultivation levels differ, we both cultivate the Three Sects' methods to develop the divine sea dantian, yet your divine sense range is only 180 zhang?"<br/>
"You're not holding back in front of me, are you?"<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately replied: "Big Brother, this is my full strength."<br/>
Sun Lingtong was puzzled: "That doesn't seem right. 150 zhang is the average level for Foundation Establishment cultivators, how can the Mirror Platform Penetrating Method only reach 180 zhang? This doesn't add up."<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and voluntarily explained: "Big Brother, you don't know about this. The advantages of the Mirror Platform Penetrating Method need to be paired with external objects to be fully manifested."<br/>
"According to teachings of the Master of the Three Sects, I need to refine split mirrors. Each split mirror can project my divine sense to a farther place. The material and grade of the split mirrors affect the projection effect differently."<br/>
"Once I have enough split mirrors, I can cover the entirety of Cloud Concealment Mountain. However, the divine sense projected through multiple split mirrors becomes very weak, and the sensing becomes very blurry."<br/>
Sun Lingtong relaxed his brow: "So that's how it is."<br/>
He finally put his mind at ease.<br/>
The competition just now was just an excuse he used to help Ning Zhuo better master his divine sense. After all, Ning Zhuo had only recently advanced to Foundation Establishment, while he, Sun Lingtong, had long been at the late Foundation Establishment level.<br/>
Qi Refining cultivators can only use divine thought within their own bodies and cannot use it to investigate outside. Even when reading jade slips, they have to press them against their foreheads.<br/>
But upon reaching Foundation Establishment, divine thought can condense and upgrade, forming divine sense. Divine sense can investigate outside the body, and in early Foundation Establishment, it generally has a range of about 150 zhang around the body.<br/>
Cultivators who specialize in the divine sea upper dantian, by the time they reach Foundation Establishment, their divine sense distance should exceed 150 zhang. The more excellent the cultivation method, the more it exceeds this distance.<br/>
Sun Lingtong, suppressing his cultivation to early Foundation Establishment, had a divine sense distance of over 260 zhang. The Mirror Platform Penetrating Method, originating from a Three Sects' Immortal, only reaching 180 zhang was far below Sun Lingtong’s expectations.<br/>
After Ning Zhuo's explanation, he finally understood.<br/>
The Mirror Platform Communication Method was different from other cultivation methods, requiring external objects to truly unleash its advantages.<br/>
The cultivation world has developed countless marvelous methods over time. Some methods can make divine sense invisible and intangible, some can make it extremely sensitive, and some even develop divine sense as a means of attack.<br/>
The divine sense of the Mirror Platform Communication Method needing to be paired with external objects might seem peculiar, but it also aligns with the principles of the Master of the Three Sects — after all, it is a mechanical arts inheritance. Utilizing external objects is the prime characteristic of the Three Sects' methods.<br/>
After finishing their investigation, the two quietly returned to their guest rooms.<br/>
The villagers were unaware.<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong each lay on their beds, using divine thought to penetrate the walls and communicate secretly about their findings.<br/>
When discussing the number of tiger god and fox god tablets, Sun Lingtong speculated: "Both the tiger god and fox god have been officially recognized by the Southern Bean Country as official gods, enjoying the incense offerings which can greatly increase their own strength."<br/>
"However, the tiger god seems to be far too weak. Allowing the fox god to collect incense offerings on such a large scale while remaining motionless is not logical."<br/>
"Could it be that the tiger god has been marginalized?"<br/>
In today's cultivation world, humans and gods co-govern.<br/>
Humans are the primary race, while gods are scattered throughout the world.<br/>
After a cultivation country is established, the country often subdues mountains and rivers within its borders, suppressing various gods. Some gods who refuse to submit are often killed and their bones scattered, while those who submit are officially recognized as proper gods, receiving the worship and protection of the cultivation dynasty.<br/>
A cultivation country very much needed these gods to enhance its ruling power.<br/>
Compared to humans, gods often have simpler minds. They can endure extreme environments, and can use their divine might to go to remote places, divert water, and open up mountains.<br/>
After joining a cultivation country, gods can widely absorb incense offerings, communicate with the outside world, and cultivate using the country's fortune.<br/>
Mutual benefit, a win-win relationship.</div></body></html></div>
