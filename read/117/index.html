<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 117: Watching the Tigers Fight from the Mountain</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
At the peak of Lava Mountain, deep within the mist and clouds, the current Lord of Lava Immortal City, Meng Kui, sat in the air.<br/>
<br/>
Surrounding him were layers of heavy mist and drifting clouds.<br/>
<br/>
He moved his fingers in intricate gestures while silently chanting spells.<br/>
<br/>
His entire body emanated a faint green glow as his magical power surged like tides, merging with the surrounding world in harmonious resonance.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui's entire being emitted a gentle green luminescence.<br/>
<br/>
He had been performing this spell for eight or nine days.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly opening his eyes, he reached into his storage belt and pulled out a scroll.<br/>
<br/>
The scroll unfurled in the air, revealing its entirety.<br/>
<br/>
It depicted a stern-faced man in armor with a battle flag on his back, exuding immense power and ferocity.<br/>
<br/>
Behind him, a robust striped tiger stood on a mountain peak, roaring towards the sky.<br/>
<br/>
This man was Meng Kui's clansman, a body cultivator at the Nascent Soul level, Meng Hu, one of the famed Four Generals of the Meng family.<br/>
<br/>
The artist, Han Xiongfeng, was skilled in the art of painting within the cultivation world, particularly known for depicting battlefield generals.<br/>
<br/>
His painting of Meng Hu naturally contained extraordinary qualities, embedding part of Meng Hu‚Äôs spirit and representing a portion of his talent and destiny.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui sought this painting because it was crucial for his spell, an irreplaceable artifact.<br/>
<br/>
The spell was called "Watching from the Mountain".<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui activated the long-prepared spell onto the painting.<br/>
<br/>
The scroll suddenly disintegrated, and the images of Meng Hu and the fierce tiger intertwined, separating from the painting.<br/>
<br/>
The two entities clashed fiercely, engaged in intense combat.<br/>
<br/>
The clouds roiled as man and tiger melded and separated, sometimes the man becoming a tiger and vice versa, indistinguishable from one another.<br/>
<br/>
Their spectral forms clashed within the clouds, filling the air with roars and echoes.<br/>
<br/>
The spell "Watching from the Mountain" had taken effect.<br/>
<br/>
An invisible whirlwind swept across the mountain peak, clearing away the thick mist and clouds.<br/>
<br/>
The spectral images of the man and tiger dispersed, spreading throughout the Lava Immortal Palace, Lava Immortal City, and the entire Lava Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui‚Äôs face turned pale green and white.<br/>
<br/>
He swallowed and spat out a mouthful of blood.<br/>
<br/>
A lock of his hair turned visibly white.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui possessed a talent for high perspective, allowing him to suppress his own destiny and observe the surrounding situations with clarity.<br/>
<br/>
This talent enabled him to cultivate the divine power of "Watching from the Mountain".<br/>
<br/>
By observing from the mountain, one could see the shifting clouds, the world‚Äôs changes, the lives of all beings, and the fierce battles of dragons and tigers vying for dominance.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui used the painting of Meng Hu and the tiger to complete his spell, creating a destiny field of "Watching the Tigers Fight from the Mountain".<br/>
<br/>
This field enveloped the entire Lava Mountain, affecting all living beings within it.<br/>
<br/>
Over the upcoming period, they would be driven to conflict due to various reasons.<br/>
<br/>
These tiger fights were not mere skirmishes but deadly battles.<br/>
<br/>
The participants, embroiled in these conflicts, would see their fortunes greatly diminish.<br/>
<br/>
With Meng Kui's own destiny remaining stable, he would, by comparison, rise above, gaining a significant advantage in terms of momentum and influence.<br/>
<br/>
He cast this spell not for himself, but for his grandson Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong would be shielded from the effects of the Qi Luck field.<br/>
<br/>
"Chong'er has been diligently practicing multiple spells these days," he mused. "His Qi Luck has truly recovered due to his rest and recuperation. With my spell influencing the Lava Immortal Palace, Chong'er will certainly have the upper hand in terms of Qi Luck, allowing him to proceed smoothly and unhindered!"<br/>
<br/>
Lord Meng Kui had a comprehensive understanding of the changes in Qi Luck.<br/>
<br/>
As the situation had developed, it had become increasingly unfavorable for the Lord's faction.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, the united front of the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families was steadily pressing forward; on the other hand, the repeated disturbances within the Lava Immortal Palace had left Meng Kui puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Zhu Xuanji's premature arrival and the mysterious disappearance of the shadow demon cultivators had added to the complications.<br/>
<br/>
These factors made Meng Kui realize the necessity of taking action to alter the course of events.<br/>
<br/>
The "Watching from the Mountain" spell was a significant effort, aided by a crucial painting.<br/>
<br/>
Although the spell had considerable drawbacks and would shorten his lifespan, Meng Kui deemed it necessary for the battle over the Lava Immortal Palace, for his beloved grandson, and for the overall strategic situation.<br/>
<br/>
Unaware of his grandfather's silent sacrifice, Meng Chong had been rigorously practicing spells since he was defeated by the Golden Blood Battle Ape.<br/>
<br/>
Upon waking, he dedicated himself to his training.<br/>
<br/>
His exceptional talent‚Äî"Wildsprint Thunderclap." Spell‚Äî"One Breath Technique." The breath accelerated, greatly increasing its shooting speed, turning it into a sharp offensive spell.<br/>
<br/>
His exceptional talent‚Äî"Wildsprint Thunderclap." Spell‚Äî"Embrace of Ice!" Cold air emanated from his embrace, covering his face with frost.<br/>
<br/>
He shivered from the cold.<br/>
<br/>
Although he managed to cast the Embrace of Ice spell, it didn't pair well with his natural talent.<br/>
<br/>
If he used it in combat and ended up harming himself instead of the enemy, it would be a disaster.<br/>
<br/>
An attendant nearby advised, "Young Master Meng, it's time for a break."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong nodded. "Okay, I understand." He temporarily paused his training and stepped outside to rest.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, he would have never done this, always pushing forward relentlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he understood the importance of balancing effort and rest for better progress.<br/>
<br/>
His various trials and setbacks had not only honed his skills but also refined his character, making him more mature and resilient.<br/>
<br/>
The attendant, while treating Meng Chong's frostbite, consoled him, "Young Master, you've already achieved a lot. Splitting the Five Elements' power to isolate the water element for the Embrace of Ice spell is already quite an accomplishment. Adding your exceptional talent, which significantly shortens the casting time, requires a very high level of proficiency to extract the water element and then cast Embrace of Ice. This difficulty is at least a hundred times greater than casting Embrace of Ice alone."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong grinned, showing his white teeth. "Even if it's a thousand times more difficult, I will overcome it and conquer it."<br/>
<br/>
"In this world, there is no obstacle I cannot overcome!" Meng Chong's fighting spirit was high, and his confidence was overflowing!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, at the Ning family residence, Ning Zhuo set down the jade slip and fell into deep thought.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren had sent several jade slips, all of which contained information related to spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the content was common knowledge, not grand theories like the "Theory of Spirits," nor were they any kind of secret manuals.<br/>
<br/>
In this way, Ning Xiaoren hadn't really gone back on his word.<br/>
<br/>
Since his visit to personally comfort Ning Zhuo, he hadn't come back, perhaps afraid that Ning Zhuo might make more requests.<br/>
<br/>
Among the contents of the jade slips, two examples left a deep impression on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
One was about the Four Seasons Natural Zither, the treasured spiritual artifact of the Tianyin Sect.<br/>
<br/>
The Tianyin Sect was a supreme sect, its influence spanning several cultivation nations.<br/>
<br/>
The selection of the zither's master was one of the sect's most important affairs, as such a high-level spiritual artifact was a crucial part of the sect's foundation and strength.<br/>
<br/>
A wrong choice could weaken the sect's power and cause turmoil.<br/>
<br/>
To become the new master of the natural zither, competitors had to compose and perform four different pieces, each corresponding to one of the four seasons.<br/>
<br/>
The competitors needed immense cultivation to pluck the zither strings.<br/>
<br/>
The played pieces had to integrate true emotions and align with the essence of the four seasons to gain the zither's recognition and become the new master.<br/>
<br/>
The second story was an ancient one, about the grandmaster blacksmith Lu Duan.<br/>
<br/>
It is said that Lu Duan traveled the world and discovered a small country struggling to resist the ravages of an evil god.<br/>
<br/>
The small country had a small scale of cultivators, and the evil god was incredibly powerful.<br/>
<br/>
However, the country's lord was kind and brave, deeply supported by the people, and managed to maintain a balance.<br/>
<br/>
Feeling pity for the innocent lives, Lu Duan devised a plan and, together with the country's lord and others, successfully trapped the evil god.<br/>
<br/>
Using this, he crafted the Wind Shepherd Whip to temporarily seal the god.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Duan gave the whip to the lord and told him that the Wind Shepherd Whip was not yet fully refined.<br/>
<br/>
Only when it was fully refined could it completely seal the god and, over time, transform the god's power into the whip's spiritual essence.<br/>
<br/>
The lord asked Lu Duan how to fully refine the whip.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Duan said it was a crucial period and that he needed to do things that aligned with the whip's spirit, like creating hurricanes and tornadoes.<br/>
<br/>
The lord tried using the whip to create various strong winds.<br/>
<br/>
Initially, the results were good, but then the effect sharply declined.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't refine the whip in time before the god would break free from the seal.<br/>
<br/>
With Lu Duan gone, the lord privately discovered that creating wind disasters to destroy the people's homes would best align with the whip's spirit.<br/>
<br/>
The lord was deeply hesitant, but time was not on his side.<br/>
<br/>
He made a painful decision: to sacrifice the current citizens in exchange for the future prosperity and stability of the nation. <br/>
<br/>
So, he secretly wielded the whip, creating wind disasters that killed many citizens and caused countless others to become homeless.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, while the lord successfully refined the Wind Shepherd Whip, his actions were discovered.<br/>
<br/>
He was imprisoned by the enraged citizens, and the whip's whereabouts became unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, this small country also perished.<br/>
<br/>
"Although these jade slips don't explicitly state it, the principle should be similar."<br/>
<br/>
"The key point is that aligning with the spirit's nature can make the spirit recognize its master or be refined."<br/>
<br/>
"Applied to the mechanical creations, if I want to deepen my control over Yuan Dasheng, I need to do things it wants to do."<br/>
<br/>
"So, what kind of things would those be?" Ning Zhuo felt a slight anxiety growing in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
According to the content of "The Theory of Spirits," the spirit will grow, going through stages such as the Spirit Growth Phase, Spirit Movement Phase, and Spirit Sensitivity Phase.<br/>
<br/>
"If this Spirit Movement Phase passes, will I lose the only opportunity to completely control Yuan Dasheng, making it impossible to ever fully command it again?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo mainly referenced the Wind Shepherd Whip.<br/>
<br/>
The refinement of the Wind Shepherd Whip required aligning with the evil god's spirit.<br/>
<br/>
This process had a time limit.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng likely had a similar limitation!</div>
