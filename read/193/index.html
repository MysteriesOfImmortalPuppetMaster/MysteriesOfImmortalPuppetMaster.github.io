<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Cannot be used? It's just a weapon. Used for good, it's good; used for evil, it's evil." Zheng Danlian shook his head.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji: "The cultivation techniques, spells, and artifact refining methods of the Night Rain Dynasty have almost all been lost after the subsequent eradication and sealing by one dynasty and two empires. They are vastly different from what we know today." "Your perspective only applies to the cultivation methods we understand, not to the Night Rain Dynasty."<br/>
<br/>
"Think about it, during the Night Rain Dynasty, every nightfall, the entire world would plunge into endless slaughter under the night sky." "Darkness was filled with despair and madness, and the people lived in misery!"<br/>
<br/>
"Were there no rational people in the entire world? The cultivation methods had significant issues. Under such methods, how could the weapons refined not have problems?" The Golden Core cultivators fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun had to nod: "Indeed, everything passed down from the Night Rain Dynasty is excessively murderous!"<br/>
<br/>
But then, he changed his tone.<br/>
<br/>
"Therefore, we have thought long and hard and came up with a comprehensive method to refine it." "In this refining method, we must first kill it, then bring it back to life, cleansing it with Heart-Washing Grass." "Divine Constable, we understand your concerns, and this is also our worry." "Let's follow our established plan and refine it first." "At worst, we won't use it when we enter Fire Persimmon Mountain!"<br/>
<br/>
"Alright then." Zhu Xuanji sighed lightly.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the arrow was on the string, he had no choice but to release it.<br/>
<br/>
He had been slightly manipulated by the three Golden Core families.<br/>
<br/>
But at this moment, Zhu Xuanji also needed the three Golden Core families, so he could only compromise.<br/>
<br/>
The light of the Heavenly Craft Lamp grew increasingly intense, casting a red glow over the entire artifact refining room.<br/>
<br/>
The red light permeated the surroundings, even penetrating the powerful formation in operation.<br/>
<br/>
Every Golden Core cultivator's face was tinged with a layer of crimson.<br/>
<br/>
The red light grew denser, gradually condensing into wisps, forming clouds that began to fill the artifact refining room.<br/>
<br/>
The temperature inside rose rapidly!<br/>
<br/>
The Heavenly Craft Lamp was designed to concentrate the power of flames into a single point, forming a powerful melting force.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the fact that the heat was leaking out indicated that the Heavenly Craft Lamp had been pushed to its limit, and the temperature of the lamp flame had reached a terrifying level!<br/>
<br/>
In the world of the lamp flame, the blazing fire soared seven or eight zhang high, completely enveloping the Mechanical Black Snake.<br/>
<br/>
The Mechanical Black Snake lay motionless on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The dark shadow it emitted had shrunk to its body surface, and its aura had weakened to the extreme.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, the Black Snake's expression remained defiant, resentful, and hateful, unwilling to submit!<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian's face was pale, and his body swayed slightly.<br/>
<br/>
He had consumed too much of his mana in a short time, and even his Golden Core was in a weakened state.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Zheng Shuangjun had recovered three-tenths of his state after a rapid rest and hurried over to fully support Zheng Danlian.<br/>
<br/>
Both of them practiced the same cultivation method and were now jointly casting a spell.<br/>
<br/>
Spell‚ÄîSea of Fire Dragon Victory!<br/>
<br/>
With a dragon's roar, the seven or eight zhang high blazing flames rose from the ground, transforming into fire dragons in the air.<br/>
<br/>
The fire dragons spiraled and intertwined.<br/>
<br/>
Then, they swooped down, crashing into the Mechanical Black Snake on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Each collision would stir up boundless waves of fire.<br/>
<br/>
The fire dragons dissipated and quickly reformed with the fire waves, shrinking in size each time, and flew back into the air.<br/>
<br/>
In the fire waves, the shadow of the Mechanical Black Snake continuously shrank until it disappeared from its body surface.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Snake hissed in pain, unable to withstand the continuous impact of the fire dragons, and its entire body gradually melted.<br/>
<br/>
The two Golden Core cultivators of the Zheng family watched closely, their expressions tense.<br/>
<br/>
When the Mechanical Black Snake was completely melted beyond recognition, the Golden Core cultivators of the Zheng family exchanged glances and nodded simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
"Now!"<br/>
<br/>
They formed hand seals, and the Mechanical Black Snake was suddenly released.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Snake was placed into the formation outside the lamp, immediately locked by the formation and fixed in mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family ancestor had long been prepared, fully activating an ice spell.<br/>
<br/>
Beside him, Ning Xiaohui also extended her hands, using her innate talent‚ÄîIce Jade Hand.<br/>
<br/>
The two forces combined, ultimately forming a miniature blizzard tornado that enveloped the Mechanical Black Snake.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Snake was lifted by the pure white tornado, its entire body straightened.<br/>
<br/>
The blizzard tornado quickly dissipated, leaving behind a circular ice pillar that sealed the Mechanical Black Snake.<br/>
<br/>
In the extremely cold ice pillar, the Black Snake's aura gradually dissipated until nothing remained.<br/>
<br/>
The ice pillar began to change, and a wisp of life energy gradually emerged from the extremely cold aura.<br/>
<br/>
This was the qualitative change produced by Ning Xiaohui's innate talent participating in the refining process!<br/>
<br/>
Inside the ice pillar, the life energy grew stronger.<br/>
<br/>
The Mechanical Black Snake's body also rapidly recovered at a visible speed.<br/>
<br/>
When the life energy reached its peak, it suddenly disappeared, and the ice pillar shattered into countless ice shards.<br/>
<br/>
The countless ice shards dissipated into nothingness as they fell to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, what remained on the ground was a completely intact Mechanical Black Snake with a large, flat head!<br/>
<br/>
"Heaven and earth dyed with fire dragons dancing, cold snow freezes to bring new life. Marvelous, truly marvelous!" Zheng Danlian's eyes shone as he was the first to touch the Mechanical Black Snake.<br/>
<br/>
His divine sense mixed with his mana and infused into it.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the previous obstruction, this time his mana flowed smoothly throughout the entire Mechanical Black Snake.<br/>
<br/>
Crack...<br/>
<br/>
After a series of light cracking sounds, the Mechanical Black Snake quickly transformed into a pitch-black long-handled scythe, held in Zheng Danlian's hand.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian took out a remaining piece of Night Wind Soft Iron and tossed it into the air.<br/>
<br/>
As the iron ingot fell, the long-handled scythe in Zheng Danlian's hand lightly slashed.<br/>
<br/>
A flash of dark light flickered.<br/>
<br/>
When the Night Wind Soft Iron landed, it had already been cut into ten equal pieces with smooth cuts.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Zhu Xuanji's pupils contracted slightly, and he couldn't help but exclaim in a low voice, "Such sharpness!"<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian gently stroked the surface of the scythe, his face filled with affection and excitement.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun laughed heartily: "If it weren't so, why would our clan go to such great lengths and spare no expense to refine it?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying congratulated the Zheng family's Golden Core cultivators: "This weapon refining has been a great success!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji took a deep breath, his expression becoming solemn: "Even so, we must remain vigilant!" "What you have obtained is an old artifact from the Night Rain Dynasty. For it to be passed down through the ages, it must be extraordinary."<br/>
<br/>
"Our weapon refining this time is based on the old artifact. It was already formed using the cultivation methods of the Night Rain Dynasty. We are merely processing it, and we don't understand its inner mysteries."<br/>
<br/>
"Naturally!" Zheng Danlian continued to stroke the scythe, responding absentmindedly, his tone perfunctory.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's face darkened further.<br/>
<br/>
The Zheng family's mechanical weapon had been successfully refined, but Ning Zhuo's Golden Core Stage mechanical ape was still in the process of being crafted.<br/>
<br/>
In the refining workshop.<br/>
<br/>
More than thirty artifact refining cultivators were shirtless, sweating profusely in the rising heat and firelight, continuously hammering.<br/>
<br/>
Each strike of their hammers against the iron ingots sent sparks flying.<br/>
<br/>
The forging of the Ten Thousand Strikes Black Iron required skilled artifact refining cultivators to use their mana to create refining patterns with each strike.<br/>
<br/>
When the refining patterns accumulated to a certain extent, they would connect and disappear in an instant, significantly enhancing the quality of the Black Iron.<br/>
<br/>
This was almost a common feature in all Golden Core artifact refining.<br/>
<br/>
And it was particularly evident in the Ten Thousand Strikes Black Iron.<br/>
<br/>
In the Earth-character refining room.<br/>
<br/>
Innate Talent‚ÄîGolden Stone Opening!<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Hua used his innate talent on the Red Sun Copper, gradually melting it into a liquid.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Sun Copper liquid flowed through pipes into the furnace, where it was immediately roasted.<br/>
<br/>
Frequent use of his innate talent left Zheng Hua pale, and he continuously consumed pills.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family.<br/>
<br/>
More than a dozen formation cultivators sat around a long table.<br/>
<br/>
They squinted their eyes, bent over, and focused on the walnut-sized Mountain Essence.<br/>
<br/>
The Mountain Essence was small, resembling a walnut kernel.<br/>
<br/>
It was the essence of mountain stones, heavy and capable of bearing numerous formation patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, it was often used as a formation base.<br/>
<br/>
The eighteen formation cultivators, some holding long, thin awls, some grinding with their mana, and others meticulously examining the Mountain Essence.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo diligently cultivated without interruption.<br/>
<br/>
Others were responsible for crafting mechanical parts, while he focused on his own cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
This was the benefit of managing a force.<br/>
<br/>
Tasks that could be delegated were outsourced, saving himself a tremendous amount of time and energy, allowing him to focus on more important matters.<br/>
<br/>
"Although my force has grown more than sevenfold, there is still vast room for improvement."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's current force was far from being fully developed.<br/>
<br/>
He lacked various talents and had to rely on the other two families to meet the needs of this crafting session.<br/>
<br/>
He practiced the Demonic Blood Vein Technique and still used the crude mechanical ape for now.<br/>
<br/>
The progress of his demonic cultivation was second.<br/>
<br/>
The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique was advancing rapidly! Since Ning Zhuo started practicing this technique, he had never encountered a bottleneck, progressing swiftly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo always treated it as his main cultivation, and his spiritual cultivation did not disappoint his expectations.<br/>
<br/>
This led him to speculate in his spare time: "Why do I have such outstanding talent in Buddhist techniques?" "Is it because of my early wisdom talent? Or is it due to some innate mysterious talent?"<br/>
<br/>
"Or perhaps, I am inherently righteous, upholding justice and punishing evil, aligning with Buddhist principles?"<br/>
<br/>
Among the three techniques, the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique was the slowest.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo still had two liang of Ice Jade Wine as a backup, so he wasn't worried for now.<br/>
<br/>
All three techniques were progressing, and Ning Zhuo actively practiced spells while refining his essence, energy, and spirit.<br/>
<br/>
He mainly practiced the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Each time he practiced, he used the Five Elements Ruler.<br/>
<br/>
This magical artifact could quickly separate the Five Elements Mana into five individual streams.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then used these five individual streams of mana to continuously derive or extinguish the corresponding mana, often gaining insights and becoming highly proficient.<br/>
<br/>
As for exploring the Immortal Palace, he did so three times a day.<br/>
<br/>
The focus of these explorations was not the Buddhist Gate or the Dao Gate, but the Demonic Gate.<br/>
<br/>
He chose many rewards from the Demonic Gate, using many of them on the newly crafted mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the blood spring pot and the Wild Thought Disrupting Drum.</div>
