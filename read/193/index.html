<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Cannot be used? It's just a weapon. Used for good, it's good; used for evil, it's evil." Zheng Danlian shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zhu Xuanji: "The cultivation techniques, spells, and artifact refining methods of the Night Rain Dynasty have almost all been lost after the subsequent eradication and sealing by one dynasty and two empires. They are vastly different from what we know today." "Your perspective only applies to the cultivation methods we understand, not to the Night Rain Dynasty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Think about it, during the Night Rain Dynasty, every nightfall, the entire world would plunge into endless slaughter under the night sky." "Darkness was filled with despair and madness, and the people lived in misery!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Were there no rational people in the entire world? The cultivation methods had significant issues. Under such methods, how could the weapons refined not have problems?" The Golden Core cultivators fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Zheng Shuangjun had to nod: "Indeed, everything passed down from the Night Rain Dynasty is excessively murderous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">But then, he changed his tone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Therefore, we have thought long and hard and came up with a comprehensive method to refine it." "In this refining method, we must first kill it, then bring it back to life, cleansing it with Heart-Washing Grass." "Divine Constable, we understand your concerns, and this is also our worry." "Let's follow our established plan and refine it first." "At worst, we won't use it when we enter Fire Persimmon Mountain!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Alright then." Zhu Xuanji sighed lightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Now that the arrow was on the string, he had no choice but to release it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He had been slightly manipulated by the three Golden Core families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">But at this moment, Zhu Xuanji also needed the three Golden Core families, so he could only compromise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The light of the Heavenly Craft Lamp grew increasingly intense, casting a red glow over the entire artifact refining room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The red light permeated the surroundings, even penetrating the powerful formation in operation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Every Golden Core cultivator's face was tinged with a layer of crimson.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The red light grew denser, gradually condensing into wisps, forming clouds that began to fill the artifact refining room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The temperature inside rose rapidly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Heavenly Craft Lamp was designed to concentrate the power of flames into a single point, forming a powerful melting force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Now, the fact that the heat was leaking out indicated that the Heavenly Craft Lamp had been pushed to its limit, and the temperature of the lamp flame had reached a terrifying level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In the world of the lamp flame, the blazing fire soared seven or eight zhang high, completely enveloping the Mechanical Black Snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Mechanical Black Snake lay motionless on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The dark shadow it emitted had shrunk to its body surface, and its aura had weakened to the extreme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Even so, the Black Snake's expression remained defiant, resentful, and hateful, unwilling to submit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zheng Danlian's face was pale, and his body swayed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He had consumed too much of his mana in a short time, and even his Golden Core was in a weakened state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Fortunately, Zheng Shuangjun had recovered three-tenths of his state after a rapid rest and hurried over to fully support Zheng Danlian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Both of them practiced the same cultivation method and were now jointly casting a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Spellâ€”Sea of Fire Dragon Victory!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">With a dragon's roar, the seven or eight zhang high blazing flames rose from the ground, transforming into fire dragons in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The fire dragons spiraled and intertwined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Then, they swooped down, crashing into the Mechanical Black Snake on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Each collision would stir up boundless waves of fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The fire dragons dissipated and quickly reformed with the fire waves, shrinking in size each time, and flew back into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In the fire waves, the shadow of the Mechanical Black Snake continuously shrank until it disappeared from its body surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Black Snake hissed in pain, unable to withstand the continuous impact of the fire dragons, and its entire body gradually melted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The two Golden Core cultivators of the Zheng family watched closely, their expressions tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">When the Mechanical Black Snake was completely melted beyond recognition, the Golden Core cultivators of the Zheng family exchanged glances and nodded simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">They formed hand seals, and the Mechanical Black Snake was suddenly released.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Black Snake was placed into the formation outside the lamp, immediately locked by the formation and fixed in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Ning family ancestor had long been prepared, fully activating an ice spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Beside him, Ning Xiaohui also extended her hands, using her innate talentâ€”Ice Jade Hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The two forces combined, ultimately forming a miniature blizzard tornado that enveloped the Mechanical Black Snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Black Snake was lifted by the pure white tornado, its entire body straightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The blizzard tornado quickly dissipated, leaving behind a circular ice pillar that sealed the Mechanical Black Snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">In the extremely cold ice pillar, the Black Snake's aura gradually dissipated until nothing remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The ice pillar began to change, and a wisp of life energy gradually emerged from the extremely cold aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This was the qualitative change produced by Ning Xiaohui's innate talent participating in the refining process!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Inside the ice pillar, the life energy grew stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Mechanical Black Snake's body also rapidly recovered at a visible speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">When the life energy reached its peak, it suddenly disappeared, and the ice pillar shattered into countless ice shards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The countless ice shards dissipated into nothingness as they fell to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In the end, what remained on the ground was a completely intact Mechanical Black Snake with a large, flat head!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Heaven and earth dyed with fire dragons dancing, cold snow freezes to bring new life. Marvelous, truly marvelous!" Zheng Danlian's eyes shone as he was the first to touch the Mechanical Black Snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">His divine sense mixed with his mana and infused into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Compared to the previous obstruction, this time his mana flowed smoothly throughout the entire Mechanical Black Snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Crack...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After a series of light cracking sounds, the Mechanical Black Snake quickly transformed into a pitch-black long-handled scythe, held in Zheng Danlian's hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zheng Danlian took out a remaining piece of Night Wind Soft Iron and tossed it into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">As the iron ingot fell, the long-handled scythe in Zheng Danlian's hand lightly slashed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">A flash of dark light flickered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">When the Night Wind Soft Iron landed, it had already been cut into ten equal pieces with smooth cuts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Seeing this, Zhu Xuanji's pupils contracted slightly, and he couldn't help but exclaim in a low voice, "Such sharpness!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zheng Danlian gently stroked the surface of the scythe, his face filled with affection and excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Zheng Shuangjun laughed heartily: "If it weren't so, why would our clan go to such great lengths and spare no expense to refine it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhou Nongying congratulated the Zheng family's Golden Core cultivators: "This weapon refining has been a great success!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Zhu Xuanji took a deep breath, his expression becoming solemn: "Even so, we must remain vigilant!" "What you have obtained is an old artifact from the Night Rain Dynasty. For it to be passed down through the ages, it must be extraordinary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Our weapon refining this time is based on the old artifact. It was already formed using the cultivation methods of the Night Rain Dynasty. We are merely processing it, and we don't understand its inner mysteries."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Naturally!" Zheng Danlian continued to stroke the scythe, responding absentmindedly, his tone perfunctory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhu Xuanji's face darkened further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Zheng family's mechanical weapon had been successfully refined, but Ning Zhuo's Golden Core Stage mechanical ape was still in the process of being crafted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">In the refining workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">More than thirty artifact refining cultivators were shirtless, sweating profusely in the rising heat and firelight, continuously hammering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Each strike of their hammers against the iron ingots sent sparks flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The forging of the Ten Thousand Strikes Black Iron required skilled artifact refining cultivators to use their mana to create refining patterns with each strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">When the refining patterns accumulated to a certain extent, they would connect and disappear in an instant, significantly enhancing the quality of the Black Iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">This was almost a common feature in all Golden Core artifact refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">And it was particularly evident in the Ten Thousand Strikes Black Iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">In the Earth-character refining room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Innate Talentâ€”Golden Stone Opening!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Zheng Hua used his innate talent on the Red Sun Copper, gradually melting it into a liquid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Red Sun Copper liquid flowed through pipes into the furnace, where it was immediately roasted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Frequent use of his innate talent left Zheng Hua pale, and he continuously consumed pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Zhou family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">More than a dozen formation cultivators sat around a long table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">They squinted their eyes, bent over, and focused on the walnut-sized Mountain Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Mountain Essence was small, resembling a walnut kernel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">It was the essence of mountain stones, heavy and capable of bearing numerous formation patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Therefore, it was often used as a formation base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The eighteen formation cultivators, some holding long, thin awls, some grinding with their mana, and others meticulously examining the Mountain Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo diligently cultivated without interruption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Others were responsible for crafting mechanical parts, while he focused on his own cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">This was the benefit of managing a force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Tasks that could be delegated were outsourced, saving himself a tremendous amount of time and energy, allowing him to focus on more important matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Although my force has grown more than sevenfold, there is still vast room for improvement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo's current force was far from being fully developed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He lacked various talents and had to rely on the other two families to meet the needs of this crafting session.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He practiced the Demonic Blood Vein Technique and still used the crude mechanical ape for now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The progress of his demonic cultivation was second.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique was advancing rapidly! Since Ning Zhuo started practicing this technique, he had never encountered a bottleneck, progressing swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo always treated it as his main cultivation, and his spiritual cultivation did not disappoint his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This led him to speculate in his spare time: "Why do I have such outstanding talent in Buddhist techniques?" "Is it because of my early wisdom talent? Or is it due to some innate mysterious talent?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Or perhaps, I am inherently righteous, upholding justice and punishing evil, aligning with Buddhist principles?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Among the three techniques, the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique was the slowest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">However, Ning Zhuo still had two liang of Ice Jade Wine as a backup, so he wasn't worried for now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">All three techniques were progressing, and Ning Zhuo actively practiced spells while refining his essence, energy, and spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He mainly practiced the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Each time he practiced, he used the Five Elements Ruler.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">This magical artifact could quickly separate the Five Elements Mana into five individual streams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo then used these five individual streams of mana to continuously derive or extinguish the corresponding mana, often gaining insights and becoming highly proficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">As for exploring the Immortal Palace, he did so three times a day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The focus of these explorations was not the Buddhist Gate or the Dao Gate, but the Demonic Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He chose many rewards from the Demonic Gate, using many of them on the newly crafted mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">For example, the blood spring pot and the Wild Thought Disrupting Drum.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
