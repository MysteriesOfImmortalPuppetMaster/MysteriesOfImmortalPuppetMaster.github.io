<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 290: This Is Not Cheating!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo was calculating the time for the palace examination while fully concentrating, closely observing each match.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He quickly realized that the present moment was a rare opportunity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He could stand beneath the broadcast platform and simultaneously observe the battles between twenty cultivators across ten platforms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The cultivators were showcasing their abilities, crafting mechanical constructs with various approaches in a short time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The most imposing and powerful was Zhu Xuanji's mechanical construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">It had a red headband tied around its forehead, which Ning Zhuo privately referred to as the Red Scarf Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Clearly, the Red Scarf Army was a mechanical construct primarily made from fire essence, with an extremely powerful flame attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Zhu Xuanji used charcoal-baked clay to construct the body of the construct, with fist gold only wrapping the exterior to form armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"The Red Scarf Army must have an excellent storage formation inside; it uses an incredible amount of fire essence." The fire essence consumption formed blazing flames, compressed layer by layer within the Red Scarf Army until it was nearly viscous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Flames continuously spewed from the Red Scarf Army's mouth, nose, and palms, forming fire dragons and fire walls. The flames covered the entire arena, fiercely engulfing its enemies in a sea of fire, relentlessly scorching them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Red Scarf Army thrived in the flames, while its enemies faced disaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo surveyed the ten platforms and found that almost all cultivators' mechanical constructs couldn't withstand such fierce fire attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Even his five elements soldier was no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"The only hope might be Zheng Hua's mechanical construct, right?" He privately named it the Vajra Guardian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo continued to observe and discovered that the only one capable of resisting the fire attack was indeed the Vajra Guardian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zheng Hua himself possessed innate talent, easily melting materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo speculated that he must have fused fist gold and charcoal-baked clay into a new hybrid material, using it to construct a robust and sturdy construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The black-gold, slightly gray metal armor almost covered the entire construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The joints were made of ancient wood with spirit patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The transformation of the frost flower dewdrop was similar to Ning Zhuo's approach, both being equipped with formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">However, Zheng Hua placed ice formations and healing formations within the dewdrop, allowing it to repair the Vajra Guardian's wounds. If the wound was too large, the dewdrop would split, turning into ice for temporary patching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">This patching function effectively reduced the damage from enemy attacks targeting its wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Vajra Guardian's defense was formidable, standing firm against any attack without moving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo glanced at Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">In Ning Zhuo's judgment, among the ten platforms and over twenty mechanical constructs, only three clearly outperformed the five elements soldier in terms of performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Besides the Red Scarf Army and the Vajra Guardian, there was Ning Jiufan's Frost Envoy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">This mechanical construct was entirely made of ice blocks. The ice blocks were densely covered with rice flowers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Clearly, Ning Jiufan focused on using the rice flower dewdrop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He froze it into ice, immediately entering his field of expertise in ice mechanism constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Since the total amount of dewdrop was limited, Ning Jiufan's Frost Envoy was quite small.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">On its body, one could see some wooden and metal joints and armor structures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Jiufan's craftsmanship was impressive; these joints and armor were delicate and exquisite, quite eye-catching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Frost Envoy could release an ice formation, and as the freezing aura spread, the enemy's movements would slow down until their joints and other vital parts were frozen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Facing these three, my five elements soldier is likely to be defeated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Perhaps there's a slim chance against Zheng Hua, but Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan have almost no hope of victory!" Ning Zhuo compared and had a clear self-awareness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">All Golden Core stage cultivators, although suppressed to the Qi Refining Stage by the Immortal Palace, had clear advantages in manipulation techniques, combat experience, and even mana and spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The remaining Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining Stage cultivators were not to be underestimated either. A slight carelessness could lead to unexpected defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">After all, these individuals had earned the recognition of the Lava Immortal Palace, proving their exceptional skills in mechanical arts!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"If I were to rank them, Meng Chong's mechanical skills should be the lowest, right?" Ning Zhuo's gaze instinctively shifted to one of the platforms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Meng Chong's mechanical construct was quite rough, with a very simple structure. However, he had two mechanical constructs!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">His opponent at the moment had only one mechanical construct and surrendered upon seeing Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"This person is clearly a Foundation Establishment rogue cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Has the City Lord's Mansion, with its vast influence and meticulous planning, already contacted him for a private arrangement?" Ning Zhuo tried hard to remember.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The ten platforms, with over twenty mechanical constructs, each had their own characteristics, with varying emphases on cultivation techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">For instance, Ning Jiufan's mechanical construct emphasized carving, while Zheng Hua's Vajra Guardian employed many artifact refining techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">These technical characteristics would likely continue in the subsequent palace examinations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">On the other hand, the design of the mechanical constructs also highlighted each cultivator's personality traits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">For example, Zhu Xuanji, who despised evil, would unconsciously position himself in an offensive role as a hunter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">All this information was extremely valuable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Boss Sun is in some danger," Ning Zhuo felt a hidden worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Although Sun Lingtong had diligently studied mechanical texts, his talent in mechanisms was limited. Compared to most cultivators, he was excellent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">However, now participating in the Lava Immortal Palace's palace examination, compared to this group of mechanical cultivators, his performance clearly showed a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"I'll continue using the five elements soldier."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"This kind of balanced mechanical construct often struggles in battle. This will make the enemy and spectators underestimate me, which is beneficial for hiding my true abilities!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo wasn't worried about himself, especially with the dragon turtle fire spirit's guidance, he was quite confident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But he was concerned about Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">If Sun Lingtong, under the name "Ning Zhuo," were to be eliminated in this round, others would soon discover that the "Entry Standard" was actually Ning Zhuo himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The first round of the palace examination continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo subsequently took the stage several times, conceding without hesitation when facing Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Such concessions were common and not unique to him, significantly shortening the overall competition duration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Before the end of the day, the first question of the second round of the palace examination was already completed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo let out a long breath. Despite having rest periods between each match, the overall competition was still exhausting, posing a significant test to mana, spirit, and willpower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Through the teleportation circle, everyone quickly returned to their original locations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo was soon summoned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Jiufan, full of satisfaction, said to him, "Little Zhuo, I've been watching you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Although each battle is a tough test for you, you have always remained determined and resilient, achieving victory in each hard-fought battle. This is excellent; you truly have the spirit of our Ning family and the backbone of a Northern Wind man." Ning Zhuo expressed his loyalty accordingly, then playfully bantered with Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Jiufan had grown accustomed to Ning Zhuo's thick-skinned nature. Having only lost to Zhu Xuanji today, he was in a good mood and directly took out the Golden Core stage mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This mechanical ape was previously lent to Ning Jiufan by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Unexpectedly, the second round of the palace examination had no use for it. I'll return it to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The internal mechanical components inside are also yours."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Among them is a round wooden alarm mechanism suitable for your current situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Release it to guard you day and night."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"The first question of the second round of the palace examination is over. From now on, all cultivators will face increasing danger. After all, this concerns the contest for the ownership of the Lava Immortal Palace." Ning Zhuo hadn't expected the mechanical ape he had just lent out to return to him so quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He immediately expressed his deep gratitude to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">After bringing back the mechanical ape, he opened the outer armor and saw the intricate ice sculpture mechanisms inside. Among them, the round wooden alarm mechanism Ning Jiufan mentioned was particularly unique, being made of wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo studied it briefly and felt its profundity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Jiufan, being at the Golden Core stage, surpassed Ning Zhuo in mechanical skills. Many manufacturing techniques were beyond Ning Zhuo's reach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The next day, the teleportation circle appeared, and everyone took the stage again for the second question of the competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The content of the second question still involved five portions of five elements materials and a spirit stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Compared to the first question, the five elements materials were still at the Qi Refining stage, but the quantities were insufficient, forcing many previous construction plans to be unfeasible from the design stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Because there wasn't enough of any single material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Even the spirit stone was no longer a mid-grade spirit stone but a low-grade one, requiring all cultivators to add at least one spirit gathering formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The difficulty of the second question was significantly higher than the first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo's performance was average, while Sun Lingtong and others had more losses than wins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This trend was quite unfavorable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Fortunately, Ning Jiufan had returned the Golden Core stage mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo, after completing the second question's competition, went to the medical pavilion that evening to secretly meet with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">In front of Sun Lingtong, he summoned Yuan Dasheng's spirit and re-infused it into the Golden Blood Battle Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Then, he handed the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng to Sun Lingtong for use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Yang Chanyu, who was beside them, was shocked to learn of their next plan and looked at the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng in surprise. "Are you saying this construct came from the trial checkpoint?! According to the requirements of the second round of the palace examination, can't we just use it directly without having to painstakingly construct mechanical constructs for each arena match?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes, "Why would you think that? Of course, we need to continue crafting constructs. This way, we can have two constructs in battle, just like Meng Chong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Yang Chanyu was momentarily stunned, "Indeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Thus, on the third day of the competition, Sun Lingtong directly used the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, leaving others dumbfounded!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
