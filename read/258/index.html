<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">After Fei Si reported back and received approval from the Tomb, he hurriedly returned to Cloud City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Upon meeting Zhu Xuanji and Song Fuli again, he first transmitted a message to the former: "Lord Zhu, with Fire Persimmon Immortal City and Lava Immortal Palace under siege, we must unite and collaborate to overcome this crisis. We still need to leverage the strength of Song Fuli and his group to better resist the beast tide and navigate this predicament. I've obtained authorization from Lord Meng Kui to negotiate compensation with Song Fuli. However, I'm afraid he might demand exorbitantly... Alas, our situation is indeed passive. Therefore, I hope you, Lord Zhu, will lend a hand, considering we are all citizens of the Southern Bean Kingdom!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zhu Xuanji nodded and quickly transmitted back: "I serve in the same court as Meng Kui, and we are one. Now, as we are in the same boat, I must exert my efforts. Rest assured, I will also participate in the negotiations. I have the authority to make some decisions regarding the royal family's assets." Whether from his own stance or the recent secret verbal agreement, Zhu Xuanji actively engaged in the negotiations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">With Zhu Xuanji's support, Fei Si secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He invited Song Fuli to the City Lord's Mansion and also invited Zhu Xuanji to accompany him, initiating a negotiation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">It was evidently impossible to trace the stolen treasures and return them to the Cloud Merchants within two days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The City Lord's Mansion also wanted to ally with the Cloud Merchants to resist the beast tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">To show sincerity, they decided to negotiate compensation to win over Song Fuli.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The negotiation was arduous, with the three parties entangled, and the situation was quite complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">On the surface, Zhu Xuanji and Fei Si joined forces to negotiate with Song Fuli.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In secret, Zhu Xuanji and Song Fuli had a tacit understanding, both wanting the City Lord's Mansion to pay more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">After two hours, the compensation negotiation finally reached a conclusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Loud laughter from Song Fuli echoed from the reception hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Fei Si's face was extremely grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The City Lord's Mansion paid a huge price, and he almost couldn't uphold the bottom line left by Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhu Xuanji wiped the sweat from his forehead, as he also represented the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and paid a significant price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Song Fuli was insatiable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Not only could he legitimately participate in the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace, but he also took advantage of the beast tide to make the City Lord's Mansion and the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family pay a high price for their assistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In the end, the pit of the stolen treasures was completely filled, and he even made a considerable profit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The three parties finalized the details and quickly signed the contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">A knock on the door sounded, and a cultivator from the City Lord's Mansion came to report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">At this time, the report must be about a major event.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Fei Si thought there was a problem with the city defense and hurriedly let the subordinate in, only to hear about "warehouse guards embezzling and dereliction of duty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">It turned out that with the beast attacking the city and Fire Persimmon Immortal City on the defensive, Fei Si thought of mobilizing fire persimmons to create explosive items on a large scale as a trump card in a critical moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">However, when the subordinate went to retrieve fire persimmons from the warehouse, they found that a massive amount of fire persimmons had vanished!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Since the Fire Persimmon Festival, the warehouse had been sealed, with only the management personnel allowed to enter and exit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Thus, suspicion directly pointed to the warehouse manager.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">If it wasn't him embezzling, who else could it be?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This immediately infuriated Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Good, good, very good indeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"At this critical juncture, embezzlement and corruption, truly bringing glory to my City Lord's Mansion." Fei Si was so angry that his face turned pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He regretted letting the subordinate in, exposing this matter to Zhu Xuanji and Song Fuli.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Especially Song Fuli, who once again cast a distrustful glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"I was really muddle-headed, handling official business in front of outsiders!" "Alas..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Fei Si sighed, the negotiation had truly exhausted him, and his mind was not in the right state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">At this moment, he was instead relieved that they had already agreed on the compensation and alliance plan and signed the contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Otherwise, Song Fuli might have looked down on the City Lord's Mansion even more due to this incident, demanding even more exorbitant prices.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Given the situation, to salvage his reputation, Fei Si ordered: "Bring that embezzling subordinate up!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Soon, the subordinate was brought in, kneeling before Fei Si and the three Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Speak! How did you embezzle? What method did you use to forge the formation records? Who did you sell that batch of fire essence to?!" Fei Si shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Qi Refining stage warehouse manager was so frightened that he was trembling, crying out: "Lord, Lord Fei Si, please see clearly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I am innocent, I didn't embezzle anything."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Those fire persimmons, since the festival, were directly sent to the warehouse through the teleportation formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"I only checked them, I didn't dare to touch them at all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Fei Si's gaze was sharp: "Still trying to argue!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Then why did you check multiple times, yet only today, when using the fire persimmons, did you discover the massive shortage?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The subordinate wept: "Although I checked daily, I only inspected the surroundings, not realizing the fire persimmon piles had been hollowed out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"I am indeed at fault for negligence, but I truly didn't embezzle anything, I swear to the heavens, I didn't touch a single fire persimmon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The subordinate's cries were sincere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Very well, very well, you are quite adept at evading the important points, I suppose you have long anticipated this, constantly exploiting our country's laws, haven't you?" Fei Si's face was dark, leaking killing intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zhu Xuanji sighed softly, seeing that Fei Si wanted to cut through the mess quickly, using this as a warning to restore the City Lord's Mansion's reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">This was too hasty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Zhu Xuanji couldn't stand it, stood up, and said: "I just used a method to see, this person is not lying."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"How many fire persimmons are missing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Fei Si's face was dark, staring at Zhu Xuanji like a hawk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The two exchanged glances for a while, and ultimately, Fei Si, not wanting Song Fuli to see the Southern Bean Kingdom's internal strife, had to take a step back and reported a compromised number.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhu Xuanji's eyes shone with golden light, immediately discerning that Fei Si was not speaking the truth, he was lying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Clearly, in this situation, Fei Si could only report a smaller number.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">This made Zhu Xuanji's brows furrow deeply, and his face darkened: "So many?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The loss of fire persimmons was significant, especially the loss of many millennia-old and century-old fire persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Fire persimmons are akin to fire essence, and if used by someone with ill intentions, they could cause immense harm to the Lava Immortal Palace, especially during the constant beast tide assaults.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">If the fire persimmons exploded, causing the frontline to collapse and allowing the beasts to rush into the city, it would inevitably lead to heavy casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"This matter must be thoroughly investigated, it cannot be ignored!" Zhu Xuanji stared at the subordinate, his eyes glowing with golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This was truly terrible news, even more important than the theft of the Cloud Merchants' goods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Song Fuli spoke: "To easily steal from the City Lord's Mansion's treasury and only be discovered now, could it be the same group of people?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Void Sect?" Fei Si's eyes flashed with brilliance, "It's highly possible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">If not for Zhu Xuanji, he would have immediately confirmed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">No matter what, he couldn't bear this burden, it would affect his career!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhu Xuanji, however, had principles, saying: "An investigation is still needed to determine the true culprit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He originally thought that after resolving the Cloud Merchants' issue, he could immediately return to the Lava Immortal Palace, but he didn't expect the fire persimmon theft case to arise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He rushed to the warehouse for an on-site investigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Under the Heaven-Piercing Eyes, almost nothing could escape his sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Soon, Zhu Xuanji made a shocking discovery!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Shadow Demon Cultivator?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Through the Tracing Origin Technique, Zhu Xuanji "saw" a scene that had occurred here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">A Shadow Demon Cultivator hid in the fire persimmon warehouse, took a large amount of fire persimmons, then shrouded himself in black smoke, resembling an ink python, and easily slipped out of the warehouse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The warehouse had six layers of formations, but the ink python moved freely through the gaps between the formations!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"So, the Shadow Demon Cultivator has been hiding here all along? But is he the original Shadow Demon Cultivator?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">During the Golden Core chaos, several Shadow Demon Cultivators emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Zhu Xuanji couldn't determine the true identity of this Shadow Demon Cultivator based solely on this past image.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Is it the Meng family committing theft under the guise of guardianship? Or is the City Lord's Mansion merely a victim?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">In an instant, a fog clouded Zhu Xuanji's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Seeing Zhu Xuanji's changing expression, Fei Si urgently inquired: "Lord Zhu, have you discovered any crucial clues?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"There is a discovery, the one who stole the fire persimmons is a Shadow Demon Cultivator!" Zhu Xuanji thought for a moment and decided to be frank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Fei Si's eyes widened: "Shadow Demon Cultivator?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He was stunned for a moment, then realized: "Wait, doesn't that mean anyone could be involved?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">After the Golden Core chaos, the identity of the Shadow Demon Cultivator became so common that anyone could play the role.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Zhu Xuanji slowly nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He said: "Fire Persimmon Mountain often trembles, even with the Lava Immortal Palace suppressing the mountain base, it's unavoidable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"The city-protecting formation hasn't changed for years, and due to mountain tremors, repairs are frequently needed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"When the six-layer formation was initially set up, they were tightly connected, with no space for formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"But over time, due to mountain tremors, gaps inevitably appear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"The Shadow Demon Cultivator used these gaps to enter and exit the warehouse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Fei Si's eyes widened again: "Such narrow gaps, can a person fit through?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Zhu Xuanji sighed: "It seems some kind of technique or divine ability was used."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Fei Si was speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">After a moment of silence, he fully understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Immediately, Fei Si deeply bowed to Zhu Xuanji, sincerely expressing that the City Lord's Mansion was definitely a victim, and this was not a self-directed act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Zhu Xuanji's eyes shone with golden light, constantly watching Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"I know you didn't lie. However, just because you didn't do it doesn't mean the City Lord's Mansion didn't, right?" Zhu Xuanji transmitted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Fei Si was speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Zhu Xuanji implied that Meng Kui might have secretly arranged it, keeping it from Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This was indeed possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">After all, using demonic pawns in the righteous path is taboo, the fewer people who know, the better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">If such a thing existed, Fei Si would rather not know!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The more he knew about such secrets, the more dangerous it was for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Fei Si subconsciously glanced at the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain, then realized this action was inappropriate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He frowned, immediately assuring that he would issue orders for a thorough investigation of the frontline and key areas of the Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"But as for the Lava Immortal Palace, I'm powerless." Fei Si then sighed deeply, using a helpless tone to request Zhu Xuanji to follow this lead to the end!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Zhu Xuanji also sighed: "I need to consider comprehensively."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
