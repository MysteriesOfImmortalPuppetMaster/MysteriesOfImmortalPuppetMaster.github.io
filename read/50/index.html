<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Han Ming ate voraciously, completely unlike her previous reluctant self. After finishing all the food, she still wasn’t satisfied. “Anything else?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo said, “Sorry, I’ll bring you more next time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Han Ming nodded. “It’s better to get me some spirit food. Although these mortal dishes taste good, they’re not very useful for cultivators like us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo grunted. “I’ll consider it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Han Ming continued speaking. “By the way, my soul won’t hold on for too long if you keep sucking without restraint. Sooner or later, my soul foundation will all be used up.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">At that time, Han Ming’s soul would scatter, and even becoming a ghost cultivator would be out of her reach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">It was precisely because of this realization that Han Ming chose to compromise and temporarily give in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo nodded. “Do you have any good suggestions?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Han Ming said, “Give me people! As long as I absorb more souls, I can nourish my soul foundation and continuously provide you with soul essence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo smiled. “Actually, I’ve already prepared something for you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Oh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo stood up and left the cell for a moment. When he returned, he was carrying a few monkeys in his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Han Ming’s expression darkened. “I said to give me people. With these monkeys, I can only absorb 30% at most.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo laughed. "I can accept 30% efficiency. I’m not some demonic cultivator who goes around harming people. But beasts and monsters are alright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“There are lots of monkeys on Fire Persimmon Mountain. Killing some of them can also be considered helping the city a little.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Han Ming couldn’t hold back and laughed mockingly. “You’re not a demonic cultivator, you say?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“No, you’re just unsure of my abilities and are afraid that I’ll secretly recover some power after absorbing human souls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Moreover, killing people and killing monkeys are completely different in terms of impact. You’re worried that doing so will result in being exposed sooner!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo smiled. “Thank you for the reminder, Han Ming. To be on the safe side, I’ll monitor you strictly with these mechanical needles.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Seeing Ning Zhuo take out the mechanical needles, Han Ming’s pupils shrank to pinpoints, and anger welled up from within her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">However, she only stared at Ning Zhuo and never uttered a single curse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">In the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Meng Chong couldn’t remember how many times he’d failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">To be precise, the exact number of failures was irrelevant to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He just wanted to rush through!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After clearing the first room, he picked the hanging ring as his reward. Then, he opened the door very slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Meng Chong carefully stretched the hanging ring out into Room 2.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Clang clang clang…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He generously shot out all the colorful diamonds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Innate talent – Ferocious Rushing Thunder!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Spell – One Gust of Air!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Mechanical component – hanging ring!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Three powers joined together as Meng Chong flung the door open and rushed out like a cannonball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">His speed immediately reached new heights. Although the traps behind the door were triggered, they couldn’t stop him in time. The net ended up empty, and the Thousand Jun Heavy Hammer Platform landed on nothing but floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Hahaha!” Meng Chong laughed loudly. Wrapped in bright blue electricity, he rushed to the finish line at blinding speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The floor tiles moved backward rapidly, but they were far from as fast as Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">But suddenly, Meng Chong’s puppet body fell apart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The moment before his vision turned dark, he saw the culprit clearly. There were transparent wires stretching between the walls, extremely thin and extremely sharp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The faster Meng Chong ran, the faster these wires sliced him to pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Countless puppet fragments were scattered all over the floor. Blue electricity crackled in the air for a while, but finally dissipated into nothingness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">After returning to his body, Meng Chong sulked for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Fei Si came over, and after hearing the details, he let out a heartfelt sigh. “I didn’t expect this mechanical arts inheritance to be so difficult! Perhaps we should focus more on this aspect and try solving the traps first before moving on.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“What? You want me to learn mechanical arts? I can’t even learn alchemy or artifact crafting.” Meng Chong clutched his hair and felt deeply troubled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“No, I don’t believe it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“I just couldn’t control myself properly at that speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“As long as I can see clearly, I can get through the wires and reach the end!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Alright, that’s that. Next up, it’s time for some special training. I’m not sleeping for the next three days and three nights!” Meng Chong announced in a loud voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Fei Si showed a hesitant expression and quickly gave some advice. “Young master Meng Chong, this won’t do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“You’ve been overusing your Ferocious Rushing Thunder innate talent recently. Take a look at yourself in the mirror.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Meng Chong looked in the mirror and found that he had deep eye bags, a haggard visage, and slightly sunken cheeks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“I can still rush!” Meng Chong didn’t have any hesitation as he raised his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Fei Si said urgently, “Young master Meng Chong, you should slow down a little. Although the City Lord Mansion can provide you with unlimited resources, it still takes time to replenish your essence, qi, and spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Right now, your rate of consumption is much higher than your rate of recovery. This trend is very worrying.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Meng Chong blinked. “Then how can I quickly replenish my essence, qi, and spirit?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Fei Si said, “That depends on your cultivation technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Young master, you cultivate the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation, and this technique can help you rapidly replenish your qi. But with only three levels, its effects aren’t very strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“As for your essence and soul, without a matching cultivation technique, you can only rely on your body’s natural recovery rate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Meng Chong shook his head when he heard this. “Natural recovery is too slow! I’ll go ask my grandfather. He knows a lot of cultivation techniques. As long as I get a couple to practice, won’t I be able to quickly replenish my essence and soul?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Hahaha, I’m such a genius! I have the Ferocious Rushing Thunder, so my cultivation speed is extremely fast. Cultivating an extra two techniques won’t take more than six days.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Fei Si smiled bitterly. “If only things were that simple!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“Sir City Lord has calculated that the inheritance test for the Qi Refining stage has very strict entry standards. If you cultivate a different technique, your magical power won’t be recognized. You’ll have to completely disperse your power again before you can enter the palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Meng Chong: “Huh?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Fei Si continued, “However, Sir City Lord also calculated that there are most likely two other cultivation techniques in the Lava Immortal Palace that complement the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation. Together, these techniques can allow you to cultivate all three dantians at the same time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Meng Chong sighed. “There’s no point in telling me all this. After all, I can’t even pass Room 2.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Fei Si: …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">In the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Under the aggrieved gaze of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Ning Zhuo opened the door after clearing Room 9.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He walked through the maintenance room and pushed the next door open as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Then, Ning Zhuo’s puppet body arrived in a transit hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Once he walked to the center of the hall, he heard mechanical clicking, and the stone walls fell to reveal three doors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The left door was covered in a pale yellow, auspicious aura. Inscribed on it was the word “Buddha”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The middle door shone with green light. It bore the word “Dao”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The right door exuded a strong stench of blood. Its label was “Demon”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“Well, this is different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“A Buddha door, a Dao door, and a Demon door…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo hadn’t expected this, but he quickly recalled that Three Schools Supreme Sage had practiced Daoist, demonic, and Buddhist techniques during his lifetime. Thus, the current scenario really wasn’t anything strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He touched the Dao door, but there was no reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He then touched the Buddha door, and obtained a technique – the “Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Incantation”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Finally, he touched the Demon door, and obtained another technique called the “Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique”[^1]!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Just like the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation, these two techniques only had the first three levels. But after studying them for a while, Ning Zhuo’s puppet body trembled with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“These three techniques complement each other and allow you to cultivate the three dantians simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Three techniques of Buddhism, Daoism, and the demonic way, each cultivating one dantian and all reaching Foundation Establishment at the same time?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“This method of establishing a foundation is at the top of the world!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">[^1]: Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique – Other translations have simplified this to Demonic Blood Vein Technique, but that’s a mistranslation. The technique’s name is 魔染血筋功, with 魔 meaning Demonic, 血 meaning Blood, and 筋 referring to either veins or tendons. Calling it the “Demonic Blood Vein Technique” erases the 染 character, which can mean “to dye” or “to color”. Usages of the technique in later chapters make it clear that this is an essential part of the technique’s description. “Demonic Dyeing” sounds a bit weak, so I chose “Demonic Pollution” to keep a similar meaning. “Sinew” was chosen as a more general term than vein or tendon. Thus, “Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
