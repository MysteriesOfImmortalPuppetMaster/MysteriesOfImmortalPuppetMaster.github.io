<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Flying Disk Workshop was a small and inconspicuous little workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Inside this simple workshop, Chen Cha frowned as he looked at a semi-finished mechanical construct on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Chen Cha was a black-robed old man with a gray beard and sunken eyes. Currently, he was sitting on a mechanical chair that floated several chi[^1] off the ground. His thoughts turned rapidly, but he couldn’t come up with a solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">His blueprint had encountered another wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Just how long will this one take to solve?” Chen Cha sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">There was no certainty when it came to designing mechanical blueprints. Sometimes, a problem could be figured out after one or two days, while other times, it might take weeks or months. In fact, the last time Chen Cha ran into a problem like this, it took a whole year to overcome it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Chen Cha looked at the account book on his desk, and his expression darkened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Designing an outstanding mechanical construct always required inspiration to come up with creative ideas. Chen Cha had a solid foundation and was particularly skilled in formations, but his creativity was lacking and flashes of insight were rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Back then, he didn’t think that this would be the case, so he had borrowed money to open this mechanical workshop. Unfortunately, reality gave him a hard slap in the face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Not only had he used up his family’s assets, he was even burdened with external debt. When riding a tiger, it’s hard to get off; by now, even if he sold the whole workshop, it wouldn’t be enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">It was too late for regrets. Chen Cha knew that his only way out was to design a breakout mechanical construct. Only something that would sell for tons of money in the market could save him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Knock, knock, knock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">There was a knock on the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Chen Cha frowned slightly: "What is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">A voice came from beyond the door: "Master, a visitor has come and wants to ask you for advice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Chen Cha nodded: "Bring him to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He was currently short of money and desperately needed to pay off his debts. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t take on any consultation requests, but he had no choice now but to make money wherever he could.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">A while later, Ning Zhuo slowly walked into the workshop: “This junior is called Ning Zhuo. I’m here to meet Master Chen Cha.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The old man grunted, appearing dignified but secretly looking Ning Zhuo up and down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo was wearing a clean white robe. His eyes were calm and clear, and his face was tender with youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Chen Cha’s gaze lingered on the jade pendant at Ning Zhuo’s waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">That jade pendant was engraved with a single word – “Ning”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“The Ning Clan?” Chen Cha’s eyes flickered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Fire Persimmon Immortal City had four major forces. The first was the City Lord Mansion; the current city lord was a cultivator in the Nascent Soul stage. The other three were “Formations” Zhou Clan, “Artifacts” Zheng Clan, and “Talismans” Ning Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Chen Cha felt slightly happy as he thought: “Since he’s from a big clan, this young man could be quite rich. I might be able to make a lot. I’ll point out some of his shortcomings later so he keeps asking questions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After signing a business contract, Chen Cha invited Ning Zhuo to take a seat. This contract bound both parties and ensured that they would keep the conversation strictly confidential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Chen Cha took a sip of bitter tea, then asked Ning Zhuo for details with a calm expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo explained that he was designing a blueprint for a mechanical construct and had run into a problem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Chen Cha immediately smiled internally and thought to himself: “You too?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">However, he didn’t take it seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As a mechanical arts cultivator, workshop owner, and purveyor of knowledge, he had encountered many people like this Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Youngsters always think that they’re special.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“But the mechanical constructs they design are unbearably bad! Some even have contradictory structures, causing them to immediately collapse the moment magical power enters them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Of course, these were just Chen Cha’s private thoughts. On the surface, he nodded slightly and indicated for Ning Zhuo to continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo said, “There are always casualties during the annual Fire Persimmon Festival, so I designed a mechanical construct that can pick fire persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“I named it the explosive fire monkey, and the blueprint is almost complete, except for one last thing…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Chen Cha grew impatient and waved his hand. “Okay, okay. Let me take a look.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo took the mechanical monkey out from his storage bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Chen Cha was slightly stunned and couldn’t help but exclaim internally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The explosive fire monkey’s smooth fur was a gorgeous red, drawing Chen Cha’s attention the moment it appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">As a cultivator in the Foundation Establishment stage, Chen Cha naturally had divine sense. He immediately unleashed his divine sense to investigate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">A moment later, his eyebrows were about to rise high, but he barely managed to suppress it in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“This mechanical monkey isn’t simple!” Although Chen Cha’s design skills weren’t very good, there were no problems with his vision. He immediately noticed that this explosive fire monkey had many special features.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Chen Cha reached out and touched the explosive fire monkey’s smooth and sleek fur, admiring internally: “It’s sewn together so tightly, like one cohesive whole. The fur is lined with talisman runes, making it extraordinarily tough. The craftsmanship is exquisite and meticulous, comparable to an old tailor with many years of experience.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He wanted to point out some flaws, but couldn’t.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">All he could do was lightly say: “This basic fur stitching isn’t bad.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement and said: “Mm, I did it according to the traditional spiritual embroidery method, using the pelts of some fire velvet rats. Since the rat pelts were too small, I could only use threads to sew many of them together. Unfortunately, this means that the heat resistance along the seams is much weaker.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Oh, this is your work?” Chen Cha raised his eyes and looked at Ning Zhuo in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Design skill didn’t equate to crafting skill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo was this young, but already so skilled?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Perhaps this is his specialty,” Chen Cha thought to himself as he continued scanning with his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He looked at the mechanical monkey’s skeleton and thought: “Is this sky gold? Sky gold is light, durable, and has certain spatial qualities. Since it’s being used for the skeleton, is it meant to store things?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He continued looking. Noticing the formation patterns on the bones, Chen Cha thought, “Sure enough, this is a storage formation. It’s arranged well, making full use of the skeleton and compressing the formation’s size to the limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Compressing the formation to this extent requires great skill!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Thanks to that, this mechanical monkey can still be upgraded. The creator obviously has big future plans.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Chen Cha gave praise internally. He looked at Ning Zhuo again, then looked back at the mechanical monkey on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">There was nothing to criticize about its skeleton.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Chen Cha thought for a moment and said, “Choosing sky gold for the skeleton is just mindlessly following convention, nothing special. As for the minor adjustments to the formation, they’re merely building on the works of the predecessors, which doesn’t count for much.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Chen Cha was mentally prepared for Ning Zhuo to argue back, but Ning Zhuo just nodded and said, “Actually, my first choice was the hollow snail. I planned on boiling the snail powder and mixing it with iron essence, then molding the mixture into the shape of the bones. This way, the storage capacity would be much greater than it is with sky gold. Unfortunately, hollow snails are hard to get in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Chen Cha was stunned for a moment and thought, “He even knows this stuff?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Indeed, hollow snails mixed with iron essence would be a perfect complement to the fire velvet rat pelt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Chen Cha coughed twice, took a deep look at Ning Zhuo, and calmly said: “It’s good that you know.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Then, he lowered his head and continued to scan with his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Looking at the muscles of the mechanical monkey, he guessed internally: “These muscles are made of petroleum mud in order to increase the heat resistance?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“No, it’s different… This should be a new material made with petroleum mud as the base and refined through alchemical processes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“This… is an original formula? This was actually created by the young man in front of me? What was his name again?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Chen Cha couldn't help but feel a little suspicious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This Ning Zhuo was too young. Could his alchemy skills really be so incredible?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">How difficult was it to create an alchemical formula? Even if it wasn’t a true pill, being able to create a brand-new material was also incredibly rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Chen Cha suppressed his doubts and continued his investigation, sighing internally: “Aside from the material, the skill involved in shaping these muscles is also incredible. Just based on this, it’s enough for the crafter to serve as the second hammer in an artifact workshop. For some minor magic artifacts, being the main hammer isn’t impossible either.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Seeing this, Chen Cha couldn’t help but feel slightly vexed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This mechanical monkey was more or less perfect. No matter how much he wanted to point out some flaws, he couldn’t even find any.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">If he couldn’t find any flaws, how could he expand this business deal?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Many people who came to Chen Cha for consultation ended paid many more spirit stones than they had planned. This was because Chen Cha pointed out many flaws and led them to ask more questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Apart from stressing over the high consultation fees, these people had no other complaints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">After all, Chen Cha’s advice was indeed effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Chen Cha gritted his teeth and continued scanning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He opened the monkey’s hand, and his eyes immediately shone brightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sighing internally, he thought: “This hand is exquisitely designed. Micro-formations are nested within each other, allowing the hand to move flexibly and perform complex finger movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“This combination is quite novel. The one who arranged these formations is very talented!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Was this also done by Ning Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Who is he? A young genius from the Ning Clan? How come I’ve never heard of him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Chen Cha tried to remain calm as he scanned the mechanical monkey’s skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">At this point, he finally couldn’t hide it anymore and revealed a hint of surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The magic artifact inside the skull was actually a set of three stroll bullets!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Stroll bullets are supposed to be offensive artifacts whose trajectory can be controlled at will. But these ones have been modified to fly around each other in the monkey’s brain, acting as receivers for divine sense. I’ve never seen, no, I’ve never even heard of something like this before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“There are also many talisman runes engraved in the monkey’s skull to link up with them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“How original! How creative!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Chen Cha thought about it quickly and knew that this setup would be effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Isn’t this kind of creativity and inspiration precisely what I’m lacking?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Chen Cha felt slightly sour and couldn’t help asking Ning Zhuo: “How did you come up with this idea?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo said: “I had no choice but to turn the stroll bullets into divine sense receivers. After all, this explosive fire monkey is something that needs to make me money. If I equipped each one with a formation disk, the cost would be too high. That’s why I designed it this way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“However, I’ve always felt that this isn’t an ideal solution. There are still unknown hidden dangers and unstable factors.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Chen Cha's eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Cost! Right, without a formation disk, this mechanical construct is extremely cheap to produce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Isn’t this exactly what I’m looking for? With this thing’s performance, it will definitely sell like crazy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Wait a minute…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Chen Cha suddenly looked at Ning Zhuo and felt a little angry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This mechanical construct could be considered flawless. What need was there to come ask him for advice?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">What intentions did this young man have?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Don’t tell me he’s doing this to mock me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">But after the surge of anger, doubts arose in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“Such an incredible mechanical construct… was it really designed by this boy in front of me?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“If I were the one who designed something like this at that young of an age, I would have raised my head up high and proudly paraded it everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“This is an expression of his own ability. It’s not something any ordinary person can compare to!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“But this kid is a bit too humble…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“It’s almost as if he’s feeling guilty about stealing someone else’s work.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
