Facing Sun Lingtong's question, Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and said, "First, the Black Wind Tiger Demon needs to consume a large amount of blood every day. Relying solely on their group's scavenging may sustain them for a short time, but over the long term, it would be impossible. Therefore, they must’ve had help from an insider!"<br/>
<br/>
"When I first saw the Black Wind Tiger Demon, it looked similar to the previous Night Tiger Mountain God. I guessed that the former might be the latter's bloodline, protected and supported by the latter. But then I thought, for a position like the Zheng Mountain God, it wouldn't be difficult to find a good place for an excellent descendant."<br/>
<br/>
"At the very least, they wouldn’t seek out a demon cultivation method. Why would the Black Wind Tiger Demon practice demonic techniques?"<br/>
<br/>
"The fact that the black tiger went to practice demonic techniques instead suggests that there's a big problem with the Night Tiger Mountain God!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong wasn't stupid. He had been away for over ten years, and upon suddenly going out, his mental state was slightly imbalanced, not wanting to think too hard.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, with Ning Zhuo's reminder, he immediately understood: "That's right, the first time we sought an audience with the Night Tiger Mountain God, wanting to ask for help. In the end, that deity didn't even try, only telling us to seek the Fox God. Now it seems, it might not have been laziness, but necessity."<br/>
<br/>
"It's possible that the Tiger God we saw was just someone else in disguise!"<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded and continued his analysis: "After the Fox God was intimidated by the Night Rain Demon Weapon, it told us to go to the valley in Shanxi to investigate, with unclear intentions and a subtle attitude."<br/>
"I guess it wanted to use me to uncover this secret."<br/>
<br/>
"From its perspective, as the mountain god of Cloud Concealment Mountain, it must have long known about the true situation of the Black Wind Tiger Demon, and even the Night Tiger Mountain God. Logically, it should have reported to the officials, seeking help from the Southern Bean Kingdom. It might even have been able to use this to overthrow its superior and get promoted from deputy to full god."<br/>
"But it didn't do so, instead pretending to be ignorant, playing dumb. Obviously, it believed that even if it actively reported to the officials, the result might not be as it expected. What stopped it from reporting?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong chuckled lightly: "Simple! This indicates that the Southern Bean Kingdom is not worthy of its trust, there must be a hidden hand behind the scenes. So, you actively searched around, came to Yugang Mountain, and discovered Meng Zizhong?"<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "The previous Shi surname mayor of Yugang Town, during his tenure, was diligent and managed strictly. To oust him through conventional means would have been difficult."<br/>
<br/>
"But the Meng family did it. A group of fierce bandits led by the Black Wind Tiger Demon rushed into the town and caused havoc, allowing Meng Zizhong to take over and become the current mayor."<br/>
<br/>
"All along, the Tiger Demon group has been looting in the surrounding areas, making the townspeople live in fear. Even though Meng Zizhong repeatedly conducts military training, consuming money and time, he still gained everyone's recognition and praise."<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Zizhong used his military power to prevent the royal family from easily replacing him. He also deliberately loosened surveillance, attracting a large number of rogue cultivators. These rogue cultivators thought they could take small advantages from the mines, but in reality, they were lured in by Meng Zizhong, and many became food for the Demon Tiger."<br/>
Sun Lingtong took a light breath: "How dirty."<br/>
<br/>
"However, this is a good thing for us. Little Zhuo, you want to seek Yugang Mountain, and now we know the secrets of Meng Zizhong and the Tiger Demon. If we use it well, we might be able to succeed!"<br/>
<br/>
"Next, let's continue to collect evidence, make it ironclad."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head and sighed: "It's difficult. The Meng family is a big clan, they must have prepared for a cut-off. Once they detect us, they will surely cut ties like a gecko shedding its tail. Even if we can bring down Meng Zizhong, I'm afraid it won't be our turn, it won't be my Ning family branch's turn to control Yugang Mountain."<br/>
<br/>
"Boss, sometimes evidence isn't that important, it's just an opportunity for justifiable action."<br/>
"If the situation and interests require, even grinding pearls into powder and using them as poison to falsely accuse the other party of poisoning is possible."<br/>
<br/>
"To get a share of the meat, it depends on whether we are strong enough."<br/>
At this point, Ning Zhuo's gaze became distant, his tone complex: "Essentially, we are not much different from the demon cultivators fighting for blood food in the valley."<br/>
<br/>
"Hundreds of years ago, the Supreme Emperor of the Southern Bean Kingdom founded the country. Now, the Southern Bean Kingdom can be considered as the Black Wind Tiger Demon. The Yugang Mountain we are fighting for is just the leftover scraps from this behemoth."<br/>
Sun Lingtong was silent for a moment: "Fortunately, the Southern Bean Kingdom is temporarily on our side. They need to rely on us to maintain the pattern of the Fire Persimmon Immortal City and block the advances of the inner Meng. From this perspective, the Lava Immortal Array being in disrepair is actually a great advantage for us, helping us delay the situation and gain more time to grow stronger."<br/>
<br/>
"With our current identity, if we seek help from the Southern Bean royal family, they might allow us to divide Yugang Mountain, considering the Fire Persimmon Immortal City."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "Not allow, but support. My Ning family branch is just starting, like a baby learning to walk, we need someone to give us a hand."<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go, we'll seek the local prefecture governor."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Floating Magnetic Immortal City!<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong controlled the Ten Thousand Miles Dragon, traversing through void space, arriving at the central location governing the surrounding areas.<br/>
<br/>
Looking from afar, a magnificent immortal city was situated above the Magnetic Stone Manor.<br/>
The immortal city wasn't touching the ground, using incredibly powerful geomagnetic force to float in mid-air.<br/>
Huge black-gray cubic city bricks, each as large as a house, combined to form two or three giant circular rings, slowly rotating around the entire immortal city, creating a spectacular sight.<br/>
<br/>
The cubic wall bricks contained magnetic force, mutually attracting and repelling. Thus, they could be freely disassembled and reconstructed, normally forming circular city walls, but could also become city gates, plank roads, guardrails, etc., with endless variations and wide applications.<br/>
<br/>
The main body of the immortal city wasn't a single entity, but two layers.<br/>
The upper layer was the Yang layer, the lower layer was the Yin layer, with the two layers separated, relying on magnetic repulsion and attraction.<br/>
<br/>
Although the city protection grand formation of the Floating Magnetic Immortal City was partially activated year-round, assisting various surveillance treasures, and city guard cultivators either wearing magnetic clothes or riding magnetic boats patrolling around, they still couldn't detect the Ten Thousand Miles Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Dragons can be big or small, they can rise or fall, and they can manifest or hide. This classic mechanical creation might be unremarkable in battle, but in terms of movement and transportation, it was absolutely powerful.<br/>
"Boss, it's up to you. The Floating Magnetic Immortal City can artificially create mystic force magnetic fields, maintaining invisible magnetic tracks for long periods. If the Ten Thousand Miles Dragon accidentally touches these magnetic tracks or fields, it might be detected." Ning Zhuo said.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong confidently said: "Leave it to me."<br/>
<br/>
He used his innate spirit eyes, borrowing the mechanical parts of the Ten Thousand Miles Dragon, greatly increasing his field of vision, immediately observing many invisible magnetic fields and tracks.<br/>
<br/>
In his unique vision, these magnetic tracks crisscrossed, long and short, interweaving inside and outside the immortal city, jointly weaving a complex route like a bird's nest.<br/>
<br/>
In the gaps of the bird's nest-like magnetic tracks, magnetic fields of various sizes, one after another, some centered on buildings in the city, some centered on magnetic boats or cultivators, moving around within a certain range.<br/>
The Ten Thousand Miles Dragon hid its form, carefully bypassing magnetic fields, avoiding magnetic tracks, finally arriving at the upper layer of the Governor’s mansion.<br/>
<br/>
The government office was located on the central axis of the city, with a large number of magnetic iron nails embedded in the vermilion sunken doors, colored in brass.<br/>
<br/>
Above the door hung the four characters "Floating Magnetic Prefecture" in golden light.<br/>
On both sides of the door, a pair of stone lions sat, looking mighty and impressive.<br/>
The Ten Thousand Miles Dragon silently entered the main gate, saw the ceremonial gate. Past the ceremonial gate, it came to the main hall.<br/>
<br/>
In the center of the main hall was the Governor’s desk, with a large plaque hanging in front saying "Clean Hands", and portraits of famous ministers of the Southern Bean Kingdom hanging on all four walls.<br/>
<br/>
The main hall was empty. The Ten Thousand Miles Dragon, carrying Sun and Ning, quietly entered the second hall.<br/>
The east side of the second hall was the Governor’s study, while the west side was the conference room.<br/>
Past the second hall was the backyard of the government office, the private residence where the Governor’s family lived.<br/>
Sun and Ning didn't need to go deeper, they found the current Floating Magnetic Governor in the study.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo first returned outside the study door, releasing the Heavy Armored Blood Ape: Da Sheng outside the mechanical dragon.<br/>
The Floating Magnetic Governor was shocked and angry: "Who?!"<br/>
<br/>
He was at the Nascent Soul level, suddenly standing up from his position, his magical power gushing out, firmly suppressing Da Sheng.<br/>
Da Sheng struggled to speak, and took out the letter and token.<br/>
<br/>
The Floating Magnetic Governor saw the letter, which described his past official positions, how he started, and how he reached his current position. It analyzed how he, a mere rogue cultivator, could rise rapidly and have such smooth official career, which was due to the favor and support of the Zhu royal family.<br/>
<br/>
In the latter half of the letter, Ning Zhuo finally stated that he had a major case to report.<br/>
The Floating Magnetic Governor then looked at the token, which was specifically given to Sun Lingtong by Zhu Xuanji. After all, according to the talent recruitment order, the Southern Bean royal family would reward those who met the "entry standards". So, they gave Sun Lingtong a token, convenient for him to enter the royal capital in the future and choose a treasure from the royal collection.<br/>
"Indeed, it's a royal token. Friend Ning Zhuo, you can come out and meet." The Floating Magnetic Governor relaxed his force, allowing the Heavy Armored Blood Ape, Da Sheng, to regain freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Only then did the Ten Thousand Miles Dragon reveal itself, its eyes emitting a beam of light that shone on the ground.<br/>
Ning Zhuo followed this beam of light, growing from small to large, finally landing, his body straight, solemnly saluting the Floating Magnetic Governor. He started with an apology and a request for forgiveness, then emphasized that his actions were due to circumstances beyond his control and absolutely necessary.<br/>
<br/>
"'Ten Thousand Miles Dragon', no wonder you could sneak in here..." The Floating Magnetic Governor glanced at the Ten Thousand Miles Dragon, then scrutinized Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"I know you, kid. You were very active on the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, jumping around. But if you think this place is the same, if you want to treat the Floating Magnetic Immortal City like the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, you're making a big mistake."<br/>
<br/>
"Speak up, I want to hear what major case you need to report. If you're exaggerating, don't blame me for punishing you!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, directly reporting on Meng Zizhong, explaining the matter of the Black Wind Tiger Demon, and handed over the imprinted image as evidence to the Floating Magnetic Governor.<br/>
<br/>
When the Floating Magnetic Governor first heard the case, his pupils couldn't help but shrink slightly.<br/>
He felt his scalp tingle, a chill rising from the bottom of his heart. He very much wanted to turn a deaf ear and walk away!<br/>
