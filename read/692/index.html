<paragraph index="1">Wood Attribute transforms into Thunder!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">But immediately, the wisps of lightning in Ning Zhuo's hand dissipated into nothingness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo sighed. "My foundation is still too shallow. Using Wood Attribute spells to condense Thunder Techniques - the gap is too vast."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He could sense that his Wood Attribute Realm was sufficient, but his experience and Realm in Thunder Techniques were far too lacking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo was largely unfamiliar with Thunder Techniques. The closest he had come was using various single-use Thunder Orbs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He tilted his head back and gazed at the sky. "Cultivation Techniques are as vast as the ocean and as profound as the depths of the earth. How many years have I lived? How many years have I cultivated? I haven't even spent a full year traveling the world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"There is still so much I need to learn."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After a brief assessment, Ning Zhuo realized that mastering Wood Attribute Thunder Techniques would require him to delve into the principles of Thunder-based cultivation, at least by studying several related Thunder Arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After all, his Three Dantian were already full, leaving no room to cultivate additional techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The simplest way to master a Thunder Technique would be to choose one and practice it. But back in White Paper Immortal City, when Ning Zhuo needed Myriad Manifestations Magic Power, he had to have Sun Lingtong cultivate the Myriad Manifestations Sutra instead. That path had long been closed off to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">If Ning Zhuo wanted to emulate Lin Jinglong and derive Thunder from the Wood Attribute, he needed to comprehend far more than Lin Jinglong's mastery of Thunder and Wood. Only by surpassing Lin Jinglong's Realm in these elements could he innovate and create something new.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Lin Jinglong didn't need to meet such high standards. As the primary cultivator of the Lin Family's foundational Cultivation Art, the Myriad Wood Spring Thunder Guidance, he simply needed to follow the established path of cultivation. Of course, if he aspired to greater heights, he would need to continuously deepen his understanding of the principles governing the Wood Attribute and Thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This illustrates the true purpose of Cultivation Techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Cultivation Techniques are methods that allow Cultivators to embody and learn the principles governing specific aspects of the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">A Cultivator's Realm represents the degree to which they have mastered these principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo's profound mastery of the Five Elements Realm signified his exceptional comprehension of Five Elements-based Cultivation Arts, Spells, and other techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Having long understood the underlying principles of the Five Elements, Ning Zhuo viewed these techniques and Spells merely as exercises in review.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Thunder Techniques are indeed formidable," he mused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Especially effective against Yin spirits and similar entities, they possess a natural countermeasure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Though Lin Jinglong was no match for Ning Zhuo, the Spring Thunder he displayed still stirred Ning Zhuo's envy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Unfortunately, my study of Thunder Techniques must be temporarily shelved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"This isn't my immediate priority. I have more pressing matters to attend to."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">As Ning Zhuo pondered this, a wisp of lightning coalesced within the surging Wood Attribute Mana flowing from his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This lightning bolt was at least twice as large and far brighter than the previous one, even radiating faint traces of vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">If Lin Jinglong had witnessed this, he would have been utterly astonished!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">With just a single exchange, Ning Zhuo had already deduced some of the essence of Spring Thunder from his Wood Attribute Qi. Such innate talent and aptitude would have earned him the Lin Family's utmost protection, making him a once-in-a-millennium prodigy and the hope for the family's future prosperity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Young Master, your midnight snack is ready," the Old Chef's voice called from outside the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo blinked in surprise. Two hours had already passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Cultivation knows no time," he murmured with genuine sentiment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Lost in his deductions of the Wood Attribute Thunder Method, he had completely forgotten about the passage of time. By the time he was reminded, a considerable period had already elapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Since joining Ning Zhuo's service, the Old Chef had been preparing Spirit Food to aid Ning Zhuo's cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo took his seat first, followed by the Old Chef, Qing Chi, and Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Gongsun Yan surveyed the table laden with delicacies, then glanced at the Old Chef, his heart stirring slightly. "So this elder is actually a Spirit Chef," he realized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Before Ning Zhuo sat a bowl of deep black Fish Jelly, its color resembling dark jade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo first circulated his Cultivation Art, then picked up a jade spoon and scooped out a piece, placing it in his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Fish Jelly melted instantly upon entering Ning Zhuo's mouth, transforming into a frigid current that surged down his throat, through his intestines, and into his stomach. Like a sudden cold wave, it rapidly spread throughout his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo's flesh, tendons, blood, and marrow froze instantly. A layer of translucent Dark Jade Ice Crystals visibly formed across his skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Dark Jade Ice Crystals rapidly melted, vanishing without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Yet during this process, Ning Zhuo's entire Physical Body underwent a profound tempering. His Physical Body's foundation directly improved by a small increment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Although Ning Zhuo's Physical Body foundation was already remarkably strong, the Old Chef's Spirit Food remained effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">While this method of cultivation wasn't as efficient as the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, it was still quite effective. The Fish Jelly not only enhanced his Physical Body foundation but also increased his resistance to extreme cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">This was a request Ning Zhuo had specifically made.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Since elevating his Soul to the Million-Soul Realm, he had reached the limit of his Physical Body's capacity. The Soul's pressure on his body had caused numerous dark green blemishes to appear on his skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo had been consuming the Old Chef's Dark Jade Fish Jelly for some time now. Many of the dark blemishes had turned dark green, and most had faded significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Each person at the table had a main dish before them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Before Qing Chi lay a roasted pigeon. Its entire body was crimson red, its skin glistening like glazed glass, radiating intense heat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Qing Chi tore off a leg and brought it to her mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Crunch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">With a crisp crack, Qing Chi bit down, and the pigeon leg's skin split open. The tender, juicy flesh within, brimming with the potent essence of the Fire Element, was relentlessly torn and ground between her teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">A pure, domineering torrent of fiery energy surged through Qing Chi's limbs and bones, then crashed into her dantian, stirring it into a frenzy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Her spiritual energy ignited, erupting into a roaring blaze that rapidly expanded within the scorching flood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Old Chef's main course was a pot of thick soup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The viscous, grayish-black broth simmered with tiny bubbles that constantly rose and burst. The ingredients within were indistinct, their forms flickering in and out of view.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Old Chef scooped up a spoonful of the murky soup, slowly brought it to his lips, savored it deliberately, and swallowed with satisfaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Noticing Gongsun Yan hadn't touched his food, he smiled and prompted him to eat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Gongsun Yan had been observing Ning Zhuo and the others, hesitant to pick up his chopsticks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">While the others' main courses looked passable, the dish in his bowl was a dark, viscous mass emitting an indescribably bizarre odor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">To describe the smell, it was akin to a thousand-year-old medicinal dregs mixed with aged soil, fermented animal blood, and a hint of rancidness and burnt char.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Gongsun Yan held his breath, suppressing his nausea, and forced himself to pick up a small piece. He shoved it into his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Just before putting it in his mouth, he reassured himself: Maybe it just looks bad, but it might actually taste good!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ugh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">This is awful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The moment it touched his tongue, Gongsun Yan felt an overwhelming urge to vomit, nearly spitting it out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">A nauseatingly strange flavor, a mix of bitterness, fishiness, earthiness, and burnt notes, exploded in his mouth like a bomb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">His face instantly turned from pale to green, veins bulged at his temples, and his throat convulsed violently. Just as he was about to break down, the viscous substance in his mouth suddenly transformed into an unimaginable, irresistible surge of warmth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">This warmth contained no trace of violence. Instead, it felt like the gentlest, purest elixir of life, instantly spreading to every corner of his body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">It particularly targeted the stubborn internal injuries, meridian blockages, and hidden organ pains caused by improper cultivation, innate flaws, or the lingering effects of brutal battles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Like ice melting in spring, these blockages slowly dissolved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">An unprecedented sense of lightness, comfort, and vitality replaced all the previous pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Gongsun Yan's eyes snapped open, his pupils trembling violently!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He could clearly feel his body - once riddled with wounds and flickering like a candle in the wind - being repaired and nourished!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"So powerful! This Spirit Food is incredibly potent!" Gongsun Yan exclaimed sincerely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Old Chef smiled. "This is Ghostly Primordial Organ, which possesses some healing properties."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He offered only a brief explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Gongsun Yan's expression toward the Old Chef completely changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Old Chef, your culinary skills are truly divine!" He stood up, clasped his hands in a formal salute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Old Chef slowly rose to his feet, accepted the salute, and then said, "You should thank Young Master instead. It was Young Master who cared for me. You've been using Heartfire too frequently, and your Five Elements are barely balanced. You need to strengthen your foundation and nourish your vital energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Gongsun Yan turned to Ning Zhuo and bowed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo glanced at Gongsun Yan, then at the Old Chef, who quickly inclined his head slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Understanding dawned in Ning Zhuo's eyes. He smiled faintly and said to Gongsun Yan, "Sit down and finish your meal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Gongsun Yan and the Old Chef resumed their seats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Crunch, crunch...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Qing Chi, cradling a roasted pigeon, was devouring it with gusto.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">After supper, Ning Zhuo summoned Gongsun Yan to the cultivation chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Five Elements Life-Death Fan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">With a gentle wave of his Natal Magic Artifact, Ning Zhuo manipulated the Five Elements, causing Gongsun Yan's bronze skin to glow as if breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">With each pulse-like flicker, Gongsun Yan's bronze complexion dimmed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo gazed intently at Gongsun Yan. "I need to examine your entire body. May I?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Without the slightest hesitation, Gongsun Yan nodded. "Please, Young Master, proceed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Only then did Ning Zhuo unleash his divine sense, enveloping Gongsun Yan's entire body and scanning every inch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Gradually, a clear picture of Gongsun Yan's internal condition formed in Ning Zhuo's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The medical treatment he had provided earlier had already brought significant relief. However, after consuming the Ghostly Primordial Organ, while it had healed many of Gongsun Yan's hidden injuries, it had also disrupted the balance of his Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">But just now, when Ning Zhuo used the Five Elements Life-Death Fan for the second time, he had once again harmonized Gongsun Yan's Five Elements into perfect alignment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">That Old Chef took matters into his own hands... Ning Zhuo chuckled inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The Old Chef's claim that "Young Master Ning Zhuo specifically arranged for me to prepare the Ghostly Primordial Organ for you" was, of course, a fabrication. The Old Chef had concocted the story on the spot, right in front of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">His purpose was to demonstrate his power and intimidate Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Under Lin Jinglong's command, Gongsun Yan had held a position of considerable influence. As a newcomer joining Ning Zhuo's ranks, he would naturally need to adjust his standing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">After all, who wouldn't want to climb higher?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Old Chef acted preemptively, using Spirit Food to subtly discipline Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He demonstrated his strength to ensure Gongsun Yan wouldn't challenge his position. This was Old Chef's intention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo was pleased with this outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Firstly, his bond with Old Chef was far deeper than his connection with Gongsun Yan. Secondly, Old Chef's loyalty and gratitude had been clearly demonstrated in White Paper Immortal City, earning Ning Zhuo's trust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Finally, Old Chef's intimidation of Gongsun Yan would make the latter realize that Ning Zhuo's power extended beyond his personal abilities. This would further solidify Ning Zhuo's authority.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Thus, Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Old Chef's experience allowed him to act preemptively, eliminating potential threats. Truly commendable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo secretly raised his evaluation of Old Chef by another level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Dismissing these thoughts, Ning Zhuo turned to Gongsun Yan. "Attempt to activate your Heartfire and let me observe it closely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Yes, Young Master," Gongsun Yan replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo studied the Heartfire, gaining new insights, and then discussed Fire Attribute Cultivation Techniques with Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">As their conversation progressed, Gongsun Yan grew increasingly astonished, his admiration for Ning Zhuo deepening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo said, "Even with my Innate Dharma Fan to help you regulate the Five Elements, the inherent flaws of Heartfire remain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Therefore, my method is fundamentally no different from Thunderstruck Wood - Spring Growth. Both offer only temporary relief, not a permanent cure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Gongsun Yan replied, "Young Master, I understand this perfectly. I've had opportunities to resolve the Heartfire's flaws since long ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"It's simple: choose a Buddhist cultivation technique and practice it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Most Buddhist techniques can quell my anger, restlessness, and other negative emotions. Some, like the Immovable Wisdom King Sutra, even allow one to cultivate using anger itself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"But for the sake of my achievements in artifact refinement, I chose a Fire Attribute Cultivation Technique instead of Buddhist Dharma."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"I've long been mentally prepared for the drawbacks of Heartfire, knowing it was a necessary price for pursuing greater heights in artifact refinement!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Gongsun Yan refused to settle for mediocrity, driven by a burning desire to achieve greatness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, falling into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Since Gongsun Yan chose to focus on a Fire Attribute Cultivation Technique, he can no longer practice Buddhist techniques. Unless he gets lucky and finds a Buddhist Dharma that perfectly complements his cultivation, allowing him to cultivate both his Upper Dantian Divine Sea and his primary technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"In fact, I possess a permanent solution: the Fire Element Heart Temple!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo's Five Elements Spirit Transformation Art allows him to reshape the five vital organs, transforming himself into a living god within his own body, granting him complete control over the Five Elements within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">This was precisely the solution to Heartfire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"But for now, it can't be used directly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo had just examined Gongsun Yan's body and discovered that his heart was unlike that of ordinary people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo's Fire Element Heart Temple was designed based on his own body and the physiology of ordinary people, so it wouldn't be a perfect fit for Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Perhaps I can modify this Divine Art to make it suitable for Heart-Melting?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo kept this idea to himself, not voicing it aloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">He dismissed Gongsun Yan and retrieved Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Yuan Dasheng was trapped in a block of ice, while Meng Yehu was covered in layers of earth and dust, both inside and out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo activated his Innate Dharma Fan again, channeling the Five Elements Spirit Transformation Art. No matter how fiercely he fanned, neither Mechanical Puppet showed any response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Sigh..." Ning Zhuo sighed, his repeated failures finally extinguishing his hopes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">These two Mechanical Puppets possessed Golden Core-level combat power, and Ning Zhuo needed to repair them quickly to restore his own fighting strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">At the same time, he harbored a deeper concern: "Although Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu have long possessed full spiritual energy, their current severe damage means that, if left unattended for too long, even their full spiritual energy might not withstand the constant erosion and eventually dissipate completely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"I must repair these Mechanisms as soon as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
