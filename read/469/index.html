<paragraph index="1">Soldiers Sharing One Helmet!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This was a precious treasure, and also an army that marked history with its tenacity, as well as a defensive battle that could be called great!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The main general, Tian Han, was born into an ordinary peasant family. When he was young, due to poverty, he joined the army early.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">His character was steady and reliable, and he treated others kindly. As his military achievements accumulated and he became a leader, he still blended in with the soldiers in the simplest manner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He trained and worked together with the soldiers, gaining their support and admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">At the time of foreign invasion, as a defending commander, he resisted tenaciously and led his army in brave combat. He always insisted on going to war for the people, prioritizing their livelihood and safety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He advocated the idea that “the army’s strength comes from the people’s hearts,” always believing that the army’s power originated from the people’s support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">During the stationing period, he also led his subordinates to do many practical deeds for the farmers, such as digging wells and ditches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Therefore, the Iron Guard Army he led enjoyed high prestige among the people. Whenever war broke out, the common folk would voluntarily support his army, providing food, shelter, and even personally coming forward to help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The enemy forces were strong and occupied large areas of territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In many battles defending against foreign invasions, Tian Han always personally went to the front line, unafraid of danger. No matter how perilous the fight, Tian Han always led his soldiers in the charge, personally directing, and leading by example.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Finally, in one intense defensive battle, the situation was extremely dire. Tian Han fought alone to block a breach, and as a result of numerous attacks, was killed by a secretly launched poisoned arrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">His subordinates wept and wanted to carry him down, but he stopped them, saying, “I know this poison. I cannot be saved! Let me stand a while longer. The enemy is intimidated by me. If I stand a while longer, the enemy will need more time to prepare, and thus you will have more time to breathe.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“General!” The subordinates wept.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Tian Han stood from dusk until night. The enemy, seeing him always standing firm on the front line, did not dare to act rashly and chose to rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Tian Han used the last of his life to continue fighting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Although he died in battle, his army’s morale reached its peak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The soldiers swore to avenge their commander, and with their homeland right behind them, they had no path of retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Without the general, tomorrow the enemy will surely have their morale boosted and forcefully break in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Why not…” one soldier proposed to create the illusion that Commander Tian Han was still alive, and the others agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">They selected the strongest among them to don Tian Han’s full armor and play his role, fighting to the death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">A few days later, this impersonator also died of severe injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Soon, they selected a third impersonator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">In this way, they impersonated him multiple times. Although “Tian Han” grew weaker and weaker, he still fought stubbornly. No matter what treacherous schemes the enemy employed, he never showed signs of falling. This kept the enemy’s morale persistently low, preventing them from fully exerting their strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Iron Guard Army was few in number, yet by relying on peak morale, skilled battle formations, and the advantageous terrain they had cultivated over many years, they firmly defended their position and blocked an enemy force tens of times greater.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The enemy commander cursed. After changing three main generals in succession, they still could not break through this seemingly thin defensive line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Even their own capital was besieged, yet this line of defense had not been breached.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Their provisions were long gone. The Iron Guard Army ate horses, ate grass bark, and gnawed on leaves. Their crossbow carts had long since broken. Although the cannons remained intact, they had run out of ammunition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Cut off from their water supply by the enemy, they drank their own urine, yet did not retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">By the later stages of the battle, the enemy saw through the Iron Guard Army’s disguise. When they realized that the real Tian Han had long since fallen, they were utterly shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Because, in their eyes, “Tian Han” had truly been fighting all along!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Only then did an old enemy general, well-versed in the art of war, suddenly understand: “This armor has gained a spirit. This spirit was not created solely by Tian Han himself, but also by the unified spirit and will of this entire army!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“All our investigative methods, though thorough, were deceived, because we are facing this army’s extremely condensed will and spirit!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Tian Han longed for someone to replace him, to lead the big picture and continue the fight. The soldiers, on the other hand, longed for ‘Tian Han’ to remain, intimidating the enemy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“All their thoughts were focused on this suit of armor, so when its spirit was born, it was extraordinary!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“We were all deceived.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“What a most admirable army this is.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The old general sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">When the Iron Guard Army was reduced to only a dozen or so men, the enemy voluntarily abandoned further confrontation with them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">When passing by the hills, the enemy officers and soldiers would pay them attentive salutes, even full military salutes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">They gave up on breaking through the line of defense and bypassed it from both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Even as enemies, they felt a strong sense of respect and admiration for this army, united as one in both heart and mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">That suit of armor, worn by nearly everyone in the entire army, was named —Soldiers Sharing One Helmet!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Afterward, this spirit-filled war treasure, nurtured on the battlefield, drifted out into the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sometimes, this treasure of war was worn by outstanding generals; sometimes, because of its unremarkable appearance, it was overlooked and worn only by ordinary soldiers; and sometimes, it became part of a knowledgeable collector’s holdings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The once-complete full-body armor had long since been scattered by the vicissitudes of fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Time and war had ground it down, leaving countless marks of damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Because of its extremely unique origin, it was difficult to repair!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Therefore, at this moment, what Ning Zhuo saw Lu Hongtu take out was only a helmet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The helmet’s shape was sturdy, without any superfluous decoration. Simple lines outlined an elegant and dignified war helmet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Its overall shape was slightly hemispherical, with a wide faceplate that effectively protected the wearer’s face and neck. Unlike traditional battle helmets, its design seemed somewhat heavy, yet it did not lose its intimidating presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The helmet’s top curved slightly upward at the back, like a phoenix about to spread its wings, symbolizing the source’s spirit—soldiers united as one, pressing forward no matter how many times they died, able to “be reborn” once more!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The helmet’s main material was ancient refined iron. After multiple smeltings and forgings, it bore a bronze-like luster, carrying a hint of time’s sedimentation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Its surface had many scratches and dents—battle scars bearing witness to countless instances of steadfast defense and sacrifice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Originally, there had been padding inside the helmet, but after so long, the lining had completely disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo’s gaze was drawn to it. This rare treasure of war was very suitable for him now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After some deep thought, Ning Zhuo spoke in a hoarse, forceful voice: “This method of conducting the transaction is indeed not bad. But I must have the final say in lending ‘Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings.’ In other words, even if the Thousand Peaks Forest faces life or death, as long as I deem the timing unsuitable, I will not lend it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo said this deliberately to gain bargaining chips for the negotiations that followed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Because of this condition, even Sun Lingtong felt it was excessive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">If the “Old Monster in the Stone” found it inappropriate and did not lend it, he could simply fail to carry out this contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">However, Lu Hongtu narrowed his eyes and fell into thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After a moment, he actually nodded with a smile, indicating his agreement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Alright, I agree to this condition.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Even after both parties signed the contract, both Sun and Ning still felt somewhat dazed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“What on earth was going on?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Lu Hongtu was actually so agreeable?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Not just agreeable, he was practically stupid!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“No, that’s not right. There must be something we’re overlooking.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Lu Hongtu, carrying a large amount of military equipment, turned into a beam of rainbow-like light and flew toward the main gate of the Six Caverns Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“This time, the Old Monster in the Stone no longer had any of that Soul Formation aura.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Impressive!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“This shows that he has most likely fully digested and mastered his power, and then completely disguised himself as a Nascent Soul-level cultivator.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“However, he is still very cautious, not wanting to expose himself too early before the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King, preventing the other side from seeing through him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Therefore, he won’t even meet with Lord Long, only contacting me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“This old monster is truly far-sighted. He wants to use me as a bridge to form a cooperation with the Dragon King’s forces to jointly resist the Two Note Kingdom’s great armies!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“Then, step by step, he will carry out his plans…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Unlike the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King, he stands alone, with no forces serving him. That’s why he wants to support me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“On one hand, I have long been enemies with the Dragon King. From a certain angle, the Dragon King was once our mutual enemy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“On the other hand, he wants to befriend me through trading captured military equipment, laying the groundwork for his future struggle with the Dragon King.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Good, good, good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Old Monster in the Stone, I underestimated you in the past.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“You are truly outwardly clumsy yet inwardly refined, and very far-sighted indeed!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Thinking of this, Lu Hongtu’s lips curled into a slight smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Hmph!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“For the Old Monster in the Stone to act so cautiously and carefully, he is probably planning to contend with the Ginseng-Bearded Dragon King for the territory of the Thousand Peaks Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Whether it’s because of the ten-thousand-year earth essence’s nature or the extremely high value of the Thousand Peaks Forest, it all means that these two Soul Formation beings must engage in fierce competition.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“After driving back the Two Note Kingdom’s armies, we of the Six Caverns Sect may be able to profit from these two sides.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“Based on my current relationship with both sides, this is highly feasible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Great, this is wonderful!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun and Ning did not immediately return the way they came.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">They were both made uneasy by Lu Hongtu’s strange attitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">After all, the other side was at the Nascent Soul level, and Ning Zhuo’s “Life Hanging by a Thread” technique could not be placed over his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Carrying this doubt, the “Old Monster in the Stone” deliberately circled the Thousand Peaks Forest several times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“Could it be that he has already discovered we are impostors?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">After confirming that there was no pursuit, only then did Sun and Ning enter a cave, put away the stone sphere, and use the Ten-thousand Li Traversing Dragon to return to Green Forest Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
