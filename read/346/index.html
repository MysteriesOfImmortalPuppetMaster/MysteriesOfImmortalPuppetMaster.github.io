<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 346: Tiger Demon vs. Meng (Third Update, Requesting Monthly Votes)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
In the next moment, with a thunderous sound, the pile of rolling stones was shaken by a tremendous force, scattering and flying out in all directions. Some were even directly shattered. The Black Wind Tiger Demon leaped out with great ferocity.<br/>
<br/>
It had the head of a tiger and a human‚Äôs body, its physique now a circle larger than before, even more imposing and majestic, with a powerful aura rolling off in waves.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, it had employed a transformation technique.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn't discern the foundations of the transformation technique, so he opened his mouth to inquire of those around him: "What kind of transformation technique is this?"<br/>
<br/>
Transformation techniques are a broad category, with various sub techniques. Compared to general spells, transformation techniques are much more difficult to cultivate.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this is simple.<br/>
When it comes to changes in one's own body, the application of magical power must be more precise, not exceeding limits, otherwise the consequences can be severe.<br/>
<br/>
For example, with a flame-spewing spell, even if a cultivator uses too much magical power, the flames will just be a bit hotter or more abundant. In many cases, when burning enemies, the only drawback is a bit more magical power consumption.<br/>
<br/>
But in transformation techniques, if too much magical power is used, it can cause one's physical body to explode, resulting in a sudden burst with flesh flying and bone fragments scattering.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God said: "From what we can see now, it's just a simple giant transformation technique, along with a great increase in strength."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong‚Äôs pupils flashed with mysterious light, clearly using his innate abilities to observe. He quickly shook his head: "Demonic energy is surging outwards, the internal flesh and blood are in chaos, I can't see clearly."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said: "The books say that if the giant transformation technique is only at a rudimentary stage, it merely increases strength greatly, consuming much physical energy. Speed decreases, and after the body size increases, it becomes easier to suffer attacks and sustain more damage."<br/>
<br/>
"At present, what level is this Black Wind Tiger Demon's giant transformation technique at?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's practical combat experience was far less than his book knowledge. Almost all of his knowledge came from books and classics.<br/>
<br/>
He had very little actual combat experience, especially involving Golden Core level battles.<br/>
<br/>
Even in the final stage of the Magma Immortal Palace dispute, when he fought against Golden Core cultivators, he mostly relied on mechanical constructs, and his opponents had various restrictions and constraints.<br/>
<br/>
Unable to figure it out himself, Ning Zhuo immediately sought advice.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shook his head, as he was only a Foundation Establishment cultivator who had long been stuck in the black market, confined within Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Although he had traveled far and wide with his master before, his experience with Golden Core level combat was still very limited.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God was also not particularly experienced in this area. After all, before becoming a god, she was only at the Foundation Establishment level. After becoming a god, although she reached a level equivalent to a human's Golden Core stage, her range of activity was limited to Fog Concealment Mountain, confined to one area.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment of silence, the Fox God said: "How well the giant transformation technique has been cultivated is difficult for me to discern just by looking. The upcoming actual combat will surely verify the Black Tiger's proficiency in this spell."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn't learn much, feeling slightly disappointed. He calmed his mind and continued to observe the battle.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong, seeing the Black Wind Tiger Demon grow to twice its size, his pupils contracted slightly. He immediately increased his magical power, employing various earth-based spells.<br/>
He continued to maintain the flying sand and rolling stones, trapping the Black Wind Tiger Demon within, then added a petrification spell.<br/>
<br/>
A grayish-white color spread over the Black Wind Tiger Demon's entire body.<br/>
<br/>
Its flesh, skin, and fur were all being eroded by the spell, turning to stone.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon shook its body, shedding its fur and directly dissolving the surface layer of flesh.<br/>
<br/>
After this self-mutilation, it was a bloody mess, but it had also escaped the petrification spell.<br/>
<br/>
A breath later, it grew new skin, flesh, and tiger fur, especially the thick black tiger fur, which was even more lush than before.<br/>
<br/>
Flesh and Blood Devouring Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators of this demonic technique have extremely powerful regenerative abilities.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon, relying solely on the characteristics of its technique, had nullified Meng Zizhong's petrification spell.<br/>
Seeing it wasn't successful, Meng Zizhong immediately canceled the petrification spell and cast a falling rock spell instead.<br/>
<br/>
Earth-based magical power surged from his body, rushing high into the sky. In this process of leaving his body and soaring upwards, the earth-based magical power also swept up the surrounding earth energy and elemental earth power, finally condensing into huge stone blocks in the space above their heads.<br/>
<br/>
Gray stone blocks rapidly took shape, as large as houses.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong's thoughts moved rapidly, and the giant rocks fell one after another, crashing down from above towards the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon's entire body's muscles tensed, driving its enormous body to dodge left and right with swift movements.<br/>
Many of the giant rocks missed, with only a few hitting their mark.<br/>
<br/>
It took great strides, charging furiously towards Meng Zizhong. Each step it took on the ground was powerful and heavy, causing the ground to tremble slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong retreated while continuing to cast the falling rock spell.<br/>
<br/>
However, this time, he gathered power without releasing it, concentrating his magical power in one place.<br/>
<br/>
In midair, a stone block rapidly condensed, its size continuously expanding, far surpassing its surroundings!<br/>
<br/>
Whoosh.<br/>
<br/>
A fierce wind suddenly arose.<br/>
<br/>
The stone block, now like a small hill, cast an enormous shadow on the ground, crashing down towards the Black Wind Tiger Demon with crushing force.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon let out a low growl, suddenly planting its feet firmly. Its entire body's muscles undulated like waves, surge after surge, starting from the heart and rolling out to its limbs, finally concentrating in its hands and feet.<br/>
<br/>
During this process, its body size changed again, growing to a height of about ten feet.<br/>
<br/>
Its tiger claws and paws, having accumulated too much blood energy and demonic power, swelled up like huge lumps. The fur revealed a strange red color, reminiscent of a volcano about to erupt!<br/>
<br/>
As the hill-sized boulder crushed down, the Black Wind Tiger Demon raised its arms excitedly, lifting its claws and fiercely meeting the giant rock.<br/>
<br/>
Bang!!!<br/>
<br/>
The powerful air waves from the collision rapidly spread in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the terrifying weight of the giant rock, the Black Wind Tiger Demon's body suddenly sank, all the way down to its thigh roots, before finally stopping.<br/>
<br/>
Its entire skeleton creaked and crackled, and the power accumulated in its claws and paws suddenly burst forth, forming a cloud of demonic energy like black blood, surging and gushing out wildly.<br/>
<br/>
From its heart position, dense blood energy once again burst forth, pushing the entire skin and flesh to surge like waves.<br/>
<br/>
The Tiger Demon's claws and paws were already torn and mangled, but it felt no pain at all, mustering all its strength like a pillar supporting the sky, and viciously tore at the rock.<br/>
<br/>
The bright red blood energy permeated into the giant rock, disintegrating it from within.<br/>
<br/>
With a thunderous sound, the giant rock suddenly collapsed, directly torn into countless pieces by the Black Wind Tiger Demon. The residual blood energy formed two sharp claws in midair, moving at high speed towards Meng Zizhong.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong had been maintaining the falling rock spell and was just catching his breath, unable to cast another spell.<br/>
<br/>
He decisively used his divine sense to ignite a talisman in his possession.<br/>
<br/>
The talisman activated, the ground churned, raising a thick earthen wall around him.<br/>
<br/>
The earthen wall blocked the blood claws, and both disintegrated.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong took the opportunity to catch his breath, looking at the Tiger Demon whose claws and paws had returned to their original state, his eyes revealing even more wariness.<br/>
<br/>
Having witnessed the Tiger Demon's formidable strength firsthand, he became more determined in his tactic of weakening the opponent with spells.<br/>
<br/>
"Stab its vital points!" Meng Zizhong shouted wildly.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, earth spikes shot out from the ground around the Black Wind Tiger Demon, directly stabbing at the demon's buttocks, anus, and the sack beneath its belly.<br/>
<br/>
The Tiger Demon dodged left and right, but was still stabbed in the buttocks and inner thighs. Although it avoided the vital points, the puncture wounds continued to bleed.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon, stimulated by the pain, became even more ferocious, its eyes turning blood-red.<br/>
Fierce winds swirled around its entire body as it opened its stride, ready to charge forward violently.<br/>
It hadn't thought about defending, but instead wanted to attack head-on, accelerating to assault Meng Zizhong. Its ferocious aura was truly heart-stopping.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong's heart skipped a beat, knowing he absolutely couldn't let the Tiger Demon charge up to him.<br/>
He took a deep breath, forcing himself to cast another spell.<br/>
<br/>
Earth-based magic - Earth Python!<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, two giant pythons suddenly formed from the ground at the Black Wind Tiger Demon's feet.<br/>
<br/>
The giant pythons were yellowish-brown all over, as thick as ancient tree trunks, heavy yet agile. They directly coiled around the Black Wind Tiger Demon's lower legs. Then, they quickly moved upwards, coiling around its thighs, waist, and finally wrapping around its chest, locking the Black Wind Tiger Demon's two arms.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon's momentum was instantly halted, temporarily bound in place.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had been watching the battle intently, his eyes gleaming with excitement.<br/>
<br/>
One insight after another accumulated in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
"From what we've seen so far, the confrontation between the Black Wind Tiger Demon and Meng Zizhong is a typical close combat versus ranged attack battle."<br/>
<br/>
"The Black Wind Tiger Demon practices the Flesh Tank Blood Swallowing Technique, which determines its main fighting style to be close combat. If it gets close, Meng Zizhong will definitely be at a disadvantage."<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Zizhong is aware of this, which is why he's been avoiding close combat and using spells for ranged attacks."<br/>
<br/>
"He initially used the Flying Sand Spell and Rolling Stone Spell. The former weakens the Tiger Demon and limits its movement, while the latter crashes into it and compresses the battlefield space, further restricting its position."<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Zizhong used verbal incantations, quickly activating two spells, showing that he has clearly put effort into practicing this method of casting spells quickly."<br/>
<br/>
Verbal incantations, body seals, and mind seals are the three most mainstream methods for quick spellcasting.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo can use the Buddha's Heart Demon Seal to cast mind seals on mechanical constructs, controlling them remotely.<br/>
<br/>
For Meng Zizhong, verbal incantations assist in activating spells more quickly. The Flying Sand Spell and Rolling Stone Spell were activated very quickly, successfully allowing Meng Zizhong to seize the initiative in battle.<br/>
<br/>
"This initiative might seem insignificant, but it's actually very important. If the Black Wind Tiger Demon hadn't lost the initiative, it might have already dragged Meng Zizhong into close combat by now."<br/>
<br/>
"Seeing that the Flying Sand Spell and Rolling Stone Spell weren't very effective, Meng Zizhong immediately combined them into the Flying Sand and Rolling Stone Spell, greatly increasing its power. This is the technique of combining spells."<br/>
<br/>
"The Black Wind Tiger Demon used the Giant Transformation Technique, greatly increasing its battle power, trying to break free from the restrictions. Meng Zizhong then cast the Petrification Spell, Falling Rock Spell, as well as the Earth Spike Spell and Earth Python Spell."<br/>
<br/>
"Using the Petrification Spell was an attempt to erode the Black Wind Tiger Demon, but it was easily countered by the demon's minor self-mutilation."<br/>
"The Falling Rock Spell was used to crush and suppress, but the Black Wind Tiger Demon endured it. The Earth Wall Spell was used to defend against the blood claws, successfully protecting himself."<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Zizhong found that attacks like the Falling Rock Spell were ineffective, so he decisively adopted different attack strategies. Afterwards, he used the Earth Spike Spell to attack specific points, which did have some effect, but not much, and instead almost caused the Tiger Demon to go berserk."<br/>
