<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Sunlight filtered softly through the dense foliage, casting dappled shadows on the mountain path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo carried a wine jug, walking at a leisurely pace, brushing past branches as he went.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Birds chirped in the forest, their clear songs pleasant to the ear. The air was fresh, mixed with the fragrance of soil and vegetation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"I've come to this place again," Ning Zhuo said as he reached a deep pool, the place where he first met Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The pool water was crystal clear, with fish swimming in it. Suddenly, one leapt out of the water, creating ripples that shattered the golden sunlight on the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo continued on, circling to the mountain path behind the waterfall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">To his left, the waterfall roared, water splashing everywhere, sunlight reflecting off it to create a rainbow across the sky. To his right, the mountain wall was covered in moss, silent and deep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The contrast between movement and stillness created a beautiful harmony of yin and yang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After walking along the mountain path, Ning Zhuo stopped in front of the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He didn't enter directly, but instead used his magical powers to create a flying message on a talisman paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The message floated gently into the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Soon after, Linghu Jiu emerged from the cave holding the flying message, a smile on his face, coming to greet him personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">At this moment, the two finally met face to face for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Linghu Jiu was tall and thin, dressed in a blue robe with wide sleeves that fluttered in the wind, exuding the air of a wine immortal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo wore a white robe with wide sleeves, his eyes as clear as water, his face like a spring breeze, as radiant as the morning sun, refined and polite, immediately inspiring goodwill in others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Upon seeing Linghu Jiu, Ning Zhuo thought to himself: "What an extraordinary person indeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Recalling the intelligence reports and how Linghu Jiu had sent him the Golden and Fire Enlightenment Diagrams, Ning Zhuo felt increasingly that Linghu Jiu was no ordinary person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Today's meeting, I must get a clearer understanding of this person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Linghu Jiu had a high reputation in the Myriad Medicine Sect, his position unshakeable, surely a core figure of power in the sect, perhaps even the next sect leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Linghu Jiu silently marveled: "What a fine young man! Handsome and talented, truly a gentleman of this turbid world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Though favored by his family elders, his attire is simple and modest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Before meeting, Ning Zhuo had many speculations about Linghu Jiu. At first glance, he found Linghu Jiu's demeanor exceptional, confirming his guesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Linghu Jiu likewise had many guesses about Ning Zhuo, and at first glance, found Ning Zhuo's appearance even more impressive than he had imagined. His simple and clean attire made him feel favorably disposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Both had been looking forward to meeting the other, and at first sight, both felt goodwill towards each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Linghu Jiu smiled and said, "Young Master Ning, our sect has already received a flying message about your arrival. I've heard that you've been winning consecutive victories on Small Contest Peak recently, your fame unmatched. Even I, secluded in this deep cave, have heard of it. Please, come in quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo first set down the wine jug he was carrying, using his magical powers to keep it floating in mid-air. He clasped his hands in greeting and said seriously, "I've long heard of Brother Linghu's great reputation. It's truly my good fortune to meet you today. I've come uninvited today, bringing a humble jug of wine. I hope you won't refuse it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Linghu Jiu sniffed, his eyes fixed on the floating wine jug. He laughed heartily and made a welcoming gesture: "Young Master Ning's generous gift, I humbly accept. Please, come inside and allow me to be a proper host."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The two entered the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The cave's furnishings were simple: a stone table, stone chairs, and a stone bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Linghu Jiu invited Ning Zhuo to sit down: "This mountain cave is crude, I'm afraid it's a poor reception for such an honored guest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">But Ning Zhuo said, "The mountain scenery is uniquely beautiful, ancient and serene. Moreover, to be able to drink with Brother Linghu today must surely be one of life's great pleasures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Linghu Jiu took out stone bowls, looking expectantly at the wine jug.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">His nostrils flared again: "To be honest with Young Master Ning, I have a nose for wine, skilled at smelling wine's fragrance. Just from this wine's aroma, I can tell it's no ordinary drink. It's already stirred my heart!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">According to the intelligence reports, Linghu Jiu's love for wine had been heavily emphasized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But after meeting him, Ning Zhuo realized that Linghu Jiu's passion for wine was even stronger than what had been described in the reports.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo poured the wine while introducing its origins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This was Ice Jade Wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Produced from the Ice Heart Jade Gourd, it was a treasure passed down in the Ning family. Those who practiced the Ice Heart Technique would benefit greatly from drinking this wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo first filled Linghu Jiu's stone bowl, then poured some into his own crystal cup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo raised his crystal cup with both hands: "In visiting today, I must first thank Brother Linghu. Previously, when Lao De and others misunderstood me, it was all thanks to Brother Linghu's intervention that resolved my difficulties."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Lin Shanshan is pure-hearted and hospitable, helping me many times, even to the point of being confined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"The kindness of a friend weighs heavily on my heart, and I will surely repay it generously in the future!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Linghu Jiu stared at Ning Zhuo with drunk eyes, his breath heavy with alcohol.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Yet at this moment, Ning Zhuo felt as if Linghu Jiu could see right through to the bottom of his heart, leaving nothing hidden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Linghu Jiu pointed at Ning Zhuo: "Good lad, those are truly heartfelt words!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Hehe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He threw back his head and laughed, his eyes growing moist. Disregarding his image, he wiped away a tear in front of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Linghu Jiu's emotions were complex and hard to express.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">On one hand, he felt relieved. The junior sister he cared for had not been pursued by an outsider.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">On the other hand, he felt a bit disappointed and wronged. The junior sister he cared for had given so much, yet still hadn't caught the eye of this outsider!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Seeing Ning Zhuo silent and confused, Linghu Jiu sighed deeply: "My apologies, Young Master Ning. I have a special talent called 'Drunken Moon Seeking Immortals.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"As long as I drink heavily and enter a drunken state, my thoughts become clear, inspiration flows endlessly, and I can see through worldly affairs with piercing insight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Just now when I asked that question, I used this talent and knew that you spoke the truth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"To be honest, it wasn't just Lao De and the others who misunderstood you, even I misunderstood you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "'Drunken Moon Seeking Immortals'?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"In any case, being able to clear up this misunderstanding is a great fortune for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Brother Linghu, there's no need to apologize. On the contrary, I should thank you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Saying this, he raised his wine cup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Linghu Jiu also picked up his wine bowl, and they clinked their vessels together, both drinking in one gulp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Linghu Jiu looked Ning Zhuo up and down, suddenly sighing: "Now I know why my little junior sister favors you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He pointed at Ning Zhuo: "My junior sister respects my master the most, who is also her father, the leader of our sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Your manner, so proper and upright, is very much like my master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo hurriedly expressed humility, saying he didn't have the qualifications to be compared to a great Nascent Soul cultivator like Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Linghu Jiu suddenly stood up: "Wait a moment, let's not rush to finish the Ice Jade Wine. I'd like to treat you to a drink as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He took a few large steps to the stone bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He felt around the edge of the bed and pulled out a jug of wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Linghu Jiu returned to his seat, placed the wine on the stone table, and couldn't help but boast proudly: "I've been confined here many times, so I had someone set up a secret storage formation here to hide some good wine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Whenever I feel lonely and unbearably thirsty, I take out a jug to quench my thirst."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"This wine is called 'Meditative Brew,' and it will be quite useful for you, Young Master Ning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Linghu Jiu picked up the wine jug and poured some for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He introduced it: "The main ingredients of this wine are water from the Yellow Springs and night-wandering grass, with supporting ingredients of moon dew, netherworld jade, and nine-tailed fox tears."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"After drinking it, one's thoughts can extend down to the netherworld, gaining insights from the wisdom of ancestors and receiving guidance from the unseen realm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Linghu Jiu sighed and continued: "Because of my 'Drunken Moon Seeking Immortals' talent, my master specially invited a spirit chef to brew this wine for me. My cultivation has benefited greatly from this wine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo's curiosity was already greatly aroused. He solemnly picked up the wine cup and examined it carefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He saw that the Meditative Brew was deep blue in color, with tiny specks of light flickering within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Bringing it close to his nose for a careful sniff, the wine's fragrance was so faint as to be almost nonexistent, but it immediately made Ning Zhuo's mind clear and peaceful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Boss, I'm going to drink it," Ning Zhuo transmitted mentally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Inside the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingtong swallowed hard: "You brat, eating and drinking well out there while I have to look after you. Remember to save some for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo calmed his mind and took a small sip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">As the wine slid over his tongue, its sweetness was mixed with a hint of bitterness, like the ups and downs of life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">After the wine entered his stomach, a warm feeling spread from within, outward. The mysterious power of the spirit wine flowed through his body, bringing an unprecedented sense of tranquility and serenity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In an instant, Ning Zhuo "saw" a person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Behold, I am the Five Elements Divine Lord! The mysteries of the Five Elements are all in my hands. The Five Spirits and Five Gods obey my commands and dare not disobey!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Little descendant, do you want to learn my Five Organs Temple Divine Art?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Hahaha, listen well!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"The Five Elements are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth; the Five Organs are Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, and Kidney. The Five Elements correspond to the Five Organs, each with its own function, generating and restraining each other in an endless cycle..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo concentrated intently, listening carefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">However, the Five Elements Divine Lord's words grew fainter and fainter, and finally even his figure disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"What's going on?" Ning Zhuo's eyes snapped open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The wine's effect had worn off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo felt a sense of loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Linghu Jiu laughed heartily: "It seems Young Master Ning has experienced the benefits of this wine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo, without any courtesy, eagerly said: "Please, pour more wine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">After drinking another cup, he once again saw the Five Elements Divine Lord with his ancient appearance and divine aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Divine Lord continued to recite his Five Organs Temple Divine Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This time, after speaking a small portion, he disappeared again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo's eyes opened: "More, I need more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Linghu Jiu laughed loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo directly took away his own crystal cup and looked at Linghu Jiu: "Elder Brother, do you have a bowl?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
