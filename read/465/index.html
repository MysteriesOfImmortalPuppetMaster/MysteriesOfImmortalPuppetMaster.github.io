<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhang Zhongyi stood up, directly berating angrily: “Sun Gan, I never thought you were such a despicable person!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Sun Gan gave a cold snort: “Zhang Zhongyi, you useless trash, what are you shouting about? If you dare raise your voice again, I will immediately impersonate the Old Stone Monster and strike you all down. Who in the Red Flower Camp can stop me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“You!!!” Zhang Zhongyi was choked with anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Gan then looked at Mu Lan: “Little girl, think it over carefully. I’m not in a hurry, hehehe.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Mu Lan clenched her fists tightly, the veins on her knuckles bulged, and her entire body trembled with rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">After speaking, his figure slowly disappeared without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">She was born in the Grand Marshal’s House and naturally possessed the pride of a noble family. Now, forced into such a predicament, to her, it was simply an immense humiliation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Want to use me as a stepping stone, seizing the Grand Marshal’s Seal, what kind of beautiful dream is that?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“I would rather die than submit.” A resolute light flickered in Mu Lan’s eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Hearing these words, Zhang Zhongyi immediately became nervous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He had joined the army out of gratitude, even offering almost all his possessions. He had not come to witness, with his own eyes, the downfall of the Grand Marshal’s House.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This was far too cruel for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">If Mu Lan died, it was absolutely something he did not wish to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">So, Zhang Zhongyi hastily advised: “Niece, do not act out of impulsiveness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“If you die, and Old General Mu hears the bad news, wouldn’t he be so stricken that he might pass away in illness?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“You have already grasped divine abilities at the Golden Core stage, your talent is so extraordinary. Would it not be too great a pity to perish early?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“If those enemies of the Grand Marshal’s House learn that you died so easily, they will surely laugh themselves silly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">They had interacted for these many days, and Zhang Zhongyi understood Mu Lan quite well. Thus, this persuasion touched the depths of Mu Lan’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">She stood still for a long time, her expression gradually calming down, and her clenched fists slowly relaxed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The female general took a deep breath, her voice cold and detached: “Uncle Zhang, your previous suggestion was correct.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“I must find someone to dual cultivate with, to resolve the hidden dangers in my body!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“That Ning Zhuo is not bad. I wonder if he has thought it through?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“I must trouble you to run this errand again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zhang Zhongyi nodded repeatedly: “Alright, stabilize your injuries first, and I shall immediately seek his assistance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Hearing this, Mu Lan’s eyelids twitched slightly, and she suppressed a dull anger in her heart. Since when had the daughter of a Grand Marshal, a scion of a martial family, even needed to seek someone’s help for dual cultivation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Utterly absurd!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhang Zhongyi also knew that time was pressing, so he tried his best to accelerate the healing process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A moment later, he quietly left the Red Flower Camp and arrived near the Three Generals Camp, sending out a flying message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“May I ask Young Master Ning Zhuo to save our general once more!” Zhang Zhongyi bowed in salute to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo secretly welcomed Zhang Zhongyi into his own tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo was astonished and quickly helped support Zhang Zhongyi: “Lord Zhang, how could it come to this? You helped me treat my illness, and this junior benefited greatly. As long as this junior can help, I will never refuse. Please speak plainly!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Zhang Zhongyi then spoke of the matter of dual cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo frowned tightly and sighed: “In this matter, forgive me for being powerless.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Before this, I had already sent a letter to my family inquiring about it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“It turns out that my family’s old ancestor has already arranged a marriage for me, with a princess from the Southern Bean Kingdom’s royal family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“My Ning Family has already taken root in the Southern Bean Kingdom. In the future, if I marry into the Zhu Family of the royal house, I will surely be able to lead the Ning Family to greater heights.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“It is this junior’s misfortune that I am not worthy of General Mu Lan, missing such a good opportunity, truly a regret!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zhang Zhongyi was stunned for a moment, disappointment all over his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Yet after some thought, still unwilling to give up, he asked: “Young Master Ning Zhuo, sometimes dual cultivation and marriage are not related. We only seek dual cultivation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Could it be that the marriage contract with the princess of the Southern Bean Kingdom’s royal family stipulates that you must preserve your primordial yang?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Preserving one’s primordial yang is a gesture of importance and respect towards the Zhu Family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo hesitated for a moment, then answered: “That is not the case.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“According to what I know, that noble daughter of the Zhu Family also has preserved her primordial yin.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“If I were to prematurely lose my primordial yang here, it would be very awkward.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“It might even cause the Zhu Family to misunderstand and lead to the failure of this marriage that concerns the entire family. If that happened, the fault would be enormous! Sigh.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhang Zhongyi fell into a long silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo asked again: “By General Mu Lan’s strength, it should be impossible to lose to General Zhang.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“When it happened, I already suspected that it might be a recurrence of General Mu Lan’s old injuries.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“In my estimation, General Mu Lan is truly in danger this time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He did not hide anything from Zhang Zhongyi. He told him everything about how Shuang Jing had invited him twice, and how, during the second early tea meeting, he learned of Shuang Jing’s conspiracy against Mu Lan, and immediately refused the recruitment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Hearing this, Zhang Zhongyi clasped his hands in salute to Ning Zhuo: “I knew I did not misjudge Young Master Ning. Your character is noble and upright, consistent in word and deed, and your actions are open and honorable. If it were a common man, he would have long been swayed by intrigue and temptation, falling into the trap. But you have always adhered to your principles, unmoved by any lure. Truly a noble spirit, a gentlemanly demeanor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo smiled and hastily waved his hand: “Senior overpraises. It is merely because this junior has always been taught thus by my elders.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Senior Zhang, this junior also has some ability with the metal element. Although I cannot agree to dual cultivation, I can still do a small part here, assisting you in treating General Mu Lan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zhang Zhongyi’s eyes lit up upon hearing this, and the previous experience of working with Ning Zhuo to heal Sun Lingtong surfaced in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He could not help feeling excited: “Could it be that Young Master Ning Zhuo’s comprehension in the metal element can rival your understanding of the earth path?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo smiled: “Not too far off.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhang Zhongyi was stunned and looked at Ning Zhuo again with new respect: “Young Master Ning Zhuo is truly a seed of cultivation, a genius bestowed by the heavens.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo said: “It is only that treating General Mu Lan’s injuries has three difficulties.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Zhang Zhongyi: “Oh? I would like to hear the details.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo raised his left index finger: “First, the ‘Profound Gold Armor-Breaking Art’ is a family-inherited technique of the Grand Marshal’s House. If I want to assist General Mu Lan, I fear I must understand the whole text thoroughly, which may violate the principle of a family’s secret art.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He raised his left middle finger: “Second, General Mu Lan’s condition differs from our previous cooperation. Her injury is a conflict between the technique and her female body, not a wound caused by external reasoning. Thus, I have no way to estimate how effective the treatment could be.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He then raised his left ring finger: “Third…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo hesitated a moment before continuing: “In the previous ambush, General Mu Lan kicked over the Horse Flying Legs to my army. Although this junior can understand her reasoning, my soldiers are still resentful. This time, the uproar caused by General Zhang in the Red Flower Camp is not just about the clash of soldiers, but also stems from old grudges.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“This time, if I lend a hand, it would be only on account of Lord Zhang. Although General Mu Lan is extraordinary in strength and well-versed in military strategy, an excellent commander, to be honest, she is not a close friend.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Therefore, although I am willing to help, I must also consider the feelings of Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang, as well as the large number of soldiers in the Three Generals Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“If you want me to take action, General Mu Lan must personally come to request it and apologize for what happened during the previous ambush.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo finally said: “It is not that I am unreasonable, but I am the military advisor and ceremonial official of the Three Generals Camp, and I have always been on harmonious terms with Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang. I do not wish to make the three generals feel uncomfortable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhang Zhongyi sighed deeply: “So there are so many difficulties!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He was a famous doctor, but his strategic thinking was shallow, and he often acted on impulse and emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">If not for that, back then, he would not have offended the monarch in the royal capital and faced punishment, dropping from the Nascent Soul stage to the Golden Core stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">If not for that, he would not have rushed to join the army and handed over almost all his wealth as soon as he learned that Mu Lan and the Red Flower Camp were in trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Therefore, Ning Zhuo’s analysis broadened Zhang Zhongyi’s perspective and helped him understand the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Zhang Zhongyi clasped his hands to Ning Zhuo: “I must report these matters to General Mu Lan and let her decide.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo smiled: “I will see you off, Lord Zhang.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The two of them quietly left the camp again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Meanwhile, inside the main general’s tent, Liu Er was pacing quickly, unable to contain his excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“Dual cultivation?!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“So that’s it, that’s it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“So Teacher entrusted the YinYang One Qi Kettle to me for this matter!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Liu Er was a human-demon hybrid, with the bloodline of a six-eared macaque. Therefore, he possessed a natural talent since childhood, called Spirit-Sound Pulse-Probing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">When he activated this talent, his hearing became extraordinary, allowing him to hear distant sounds, trace the sequence of events, and distinguish right from wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">When he was stationed at the camp, he often used this talent to eavesdrop on the soldiers’ discussions, thus knowing their thoughts and treating their ailments accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">This included Guan Hong and Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Therefore, Liu Er understood those two far more deeply than they estimated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">As they got along with Liu Er, Guan Hong and Zhang Hei found the relationship increasingly harmonious, and this was part of the reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This time, Liu Er had heard a very crucial piece of information from Zhang Zhongyi and Ning Zhuo’s conversation, a revealed secret!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Liu Er now knew of Mu Lan’s hidden injury, and that she urgently needed dual cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“It is often said that yin and yang are two energies. With my YinYang One Qi Kettle, if I lend it to Mu Lan to use, she can convert her own yin energy into yang energy, so that cultivating the Profound Gold Armor-Breaking Art would no longer have hidden dangers, and she would become even more compatible. Her cultivation speed would surely soar!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Mu Lan’s predicament caused the ambition in his heart to flare up like a blazing flame!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Only…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Within Liu Er’s upper dantian Divine Sea, countless thoughts rose and fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“That Sun Gan wants dual cultivation, using this relationship as a means to seize the Grand Marshal’s Seal.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“It must be said, this is a potentially successful method.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“The Grand Marshal’s Seal… Old General Mu spent almost a lifetime of hard work to gain this authority. If I could obtain it, how many years of detours would I avoid? How many years of struggle would I save?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Thinking of this, Liu Er could not help licking his dry lips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“I also have primordial yang!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Why can’t I dual cultivate with General Mu Lan as well?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“Not only would I dual cultivate, I could also scheme to seize the Grand Marshal’s Seal, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Liu Er pondered deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Very soon, he shook his head with some difficulty: “This is hard.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“I am a human-demon hybrid, and my status is worse than Ning Zhuo’s.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“From what I’ve just heard Zhang Zhongyi say, that Sun Gan, a grand Commander of the Imperial Guard, tried to coerce her.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“My status is even inferior to his.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“What should I do?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Liu Er paced back and forth for a moment and suddenly slapped his forehead: “Why not just ask the military advisor! He has a marriage contract and cannot dual cultivate with Mu Lan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“Moreover, the military advisor has a clever mind and is on good terms with Zhang Zhongyi, and even Mu Lan values him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“With his assistance, my chances of success would definitely increase!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
