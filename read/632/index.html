<paragraph index="1">"What?!" The Scarlet Ghost General, who had arrived moments later, could hardly believe her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Among the six Ghost Generals who had breached the Immortal City, the Long Axe Ghost General was considered one of the strongest. Yet he had been slain without even blocking a single strike!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Terrifying!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Just moments ago, the Scarlet Ghost General had shared the same murderous intent and grand ambitions as the fallen Long Axe Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Now, her heart filled with terror, her Wailing Soul trembling, she turned tail and fled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In the next instant, she truly did turn tail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Scarlet Ghost General perished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Mother!" Ning Zhuo cried out urgently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He grasped Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's free hand, his face etched with worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He knew all too well that Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's condition was precarious. This "awakened" state came at a severe cost to her spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo would rather endure the bitterest of battles himself than see his mother's spiritual energy damaged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">As if reading his thoughts, Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin smiled reassuringly. "This Paper Giant was my creation," she explained. "I'd laid preparations here, so when activated, it 'awakened' me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"This state won't last. I must return to 'slumber' to immerse myself in Strange Path cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo's curiosity got the better of him. "Mother, you're cultivating Strange Path?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin nodded. "Exactly. Only by mastering this path can one cure Dao injuries. The spiritual energy within me now far surpasses what I remembered in my past life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"I suspect it must be the Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra, isn't it? Did you learn it from the Lava Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo nodded. "Mother, you guessed correctly! Though I haven't fully become the mastere of the Lava Immortal Palace yet, I've devised a plan. I haven't brought shame upon you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin smiled warmly. "My dear child, we owe everything to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"As a mother, I too have never abandoned my efforts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo's eyes reddened, his voice thick with emotion as he choked back tears. "Mother, I'm doing well. For you, I'd do anything!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Buddha Doctor nodded again. "I've just used the scythe, which counts as practical application of Strange Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"This path is indeed extremely difficult to cultivate, but I've made some progress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"My son, I truly need you to gather spiritual energy for me. The main area I operated in during my lifetime was the Flying Cloud Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"The Myriad Manifestations Sect was my sect. If you could join them, that would be ideal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo suddenly remembered something crucial. His brow furrowed as a murderous intent surfaced. "Mother, I encountered the Chaos Fate Sect! Were they the ones who harmed you? I'll avenge you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin said, "Indeed, there are my enemies within the Chaos Fate Sect. I perished due to one of their schemes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"I cannot reveal this person's name yet. The time is not right. With your current Foundation Establishment cultivation, you're still too weak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Early knowledge would alert them - highly inadvisable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Moreover, you must avoid all matters related to the Chaos Fate Sect. Keep your distance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Mother," Ning Zhuo asked, "when will I be strong enough to avenge you? When can I actively confront Chaos Fate Sect affairs?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin first furrowed her brow, then counted on her fingers. A mysterious smile appeared. "This moment will arrive sooner than you imagine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"It will refine you further, granting you profound breakthroughs in temperament."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo's eyes widened. "Mother! You understand Destiny Dao? How come I didn't know? Can you teach me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He tilted his head, his black-and-white eyes brimming with scholarly curiosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Seeing Ning Zhuo's eager anticipation, Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin chuckled. "Not everyone can grasp Destiny Dao, you know."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Little Zhuo, your life is exceptionally unique. Destiny Dao itself shies away from you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo, not understanding, asked, "Shies away? Destiny shies away from me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin gently stroked Ning Zhuo's large head once more. "To be precise, it's Destiny Dao that's avoiding you. The destiny of Heaven and Earth has its own arrangements. It won't let you learn about Destiny Dao, lest it bring terrifying consequences."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo's eyes widened. "Huh?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He quickly reconsidered. "But I really want to learn! Why can't I? Hmph, I'll just follow the example of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. What's wrong with defying fate occasionally? Every bit of knowledge gained is worth it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin laughed heartily. "What ambition! You truly live up to being my child. You're right - even if life goes smoothly, it would become boringly predictable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Go ahead and try. I believe that through persistent effort, you'll eventually achieve your goal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo nodded vigorously. "Right!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His mind was bursting with things he wanted to tell his mother, but when the moment came, his thoughts tangled like a knotted rope. Overwhelmed by joy, he even forgot they were on a battlefield!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, however, remained vigilant. "Little Zhuo, this isn't the time for mother-son chatter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"This incident concerns the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme. If he succeeds, it will bring calamity upon all living beings. The entire Ghostly Black Marshlands would fall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Let me take the main formation position. I'll deal with the two obstructive Dead Bone Giant Spirits outside first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo immediately stepped aside. "Alright, Mother, I'll stand guard for you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin sighed. "You've truly grown up. Now your mother can rely on you. However, while you're standing guard, prepare the Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra. When the time comes, you must burn this Paper Giant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo: "Huh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin didn't explain further. With a solemn expression, she slowly closed her eyes, focusing completely on controlling the Paper Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">From within the Paper Giant emerged numerous Paper Puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Under Meng Yaoyin's manipulation, these puppets began working together to repair the Formation inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo's divine sense detected this scene, causing his heart to pound violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This was far too difficult!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Even if Ning Zhuo himself tried with full effort, he couldn't understand the Formation, let alone repair it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Of course, this Paper Giant had been set up by Meng Yaoyin during her lifetime, so she naturally understood these Formations. But she was actually controlling over a hundred Paper Puppets simultaneously while repairing the Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The difficulty of such operation, the mental energy consumed, and the depth of Formation mastery required were all incredibly massive!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Even if I understood the profound principles of these Formations, I could only control two Paper Puppets for repairs at most!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Mother's mechanism control skills are actually this high? It's almost terrifying."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo was awestruck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At the same time, new worries flooded his mind—such astonishing manipulation by Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin must be draining her spiritual energy to catastrophic levels!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Mother, is this truly worth it?" he asked from the heart, unwilling to see his mother exhaust herself so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Formation within the Paper Giant was swiftly restored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">On one hand, this demonstrated Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's astonishing mastery of mechanisms and Formations. On the other, it benefited from the Long Axe and Scarlet Ghost Generals' single-minded focus on breaking through from within—by capturing the king first, they had neglected to destroy the Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Formation hummed to life, its power coalescing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">On the battlefield, the Paper Giant strained to rise, its chest heaving as it regained its footing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A faint white glow enveloped its body, the previous breaches rapidly mending until it stood flawless once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This spectacle immediately drew the Underworld Army's attention!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In Luo Si's command tent:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Disaster!" Xie Sichao's face paled. "The names of the Long Axe and Scarlet Ghost Generals have been crossed out in the military roster."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The two generals had fallen in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Luo Si barked orders: "Deploy the remaining Dead Bone Giant Spirits against the Paper Giant. Have the Vanguard General and others concentrate their full strength on it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The remaining two Dead Bone Giant Spirits continued their destructive rampage, waiting for the Long Axe and Scarlet Ghost Generals to collapse the Paper Giant from within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The sudden demise of the two generals caught the Underworld Army completely off guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">After all, they had assumed that even if the Paper Giant's defenses proved exceptional, once the Long Axe and Scarlet generals fell into disadvantage, reinforcements would be ready to assist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's sudden awakening unleashed devastating combat prowess, instantly eliminating the two generals and plunging the Underworld Army into strategic disarray at this critical point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Luo Si's command was flawless and impeccably timed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The two Dead Bone Giant Spirits lumbered forward, their footsteps shaking the earth with thunderous booms as they closed in on the Paper Giant from either flank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Simultaneously, Nascent Soul-level enemies led by the Vanguard General launched their assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Disaster!" Tie Guzheng's eyes blazed with fury, but there were no troops left to deploy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The City Lord's Paper Puppet Avatar had been driving the Four Ghost Generals into retreat. Glancing back at the endangered Paper Giant, she whirled around and poured all her strength into a desperate strike against the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Qing Chi, leading the Qing-Jiao Army, was locked in a bitter struggle with the Headless Ghost Riders. When she spotted the Paper Giant's peril, panic and fury surged through her as she raced to the rescue. But the saying held true - distant waters cannot quench immediate fires.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">As the Paper Giant teetered on the brink of destruction, Ning Zhuo involuntarily held his breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's divine sense transmitted a thought: "Little Zhuo, observe carefully now. This technique is called the Cloud Net Demonic Garment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">In the next instant, the Paper Giant's body erupted with blinding white radiance. The luminous beams pierced the heavens, triggering celestial phenomena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Clouds materialized from nothingness, swirling and surging toward the colossal figure. They rapidly coalesced into a Cloud Net Demonic Garment - a celestial attire that defied classification. Neither mist nor gauze, it shimmered like ice silk yet harbored needle-like prisms within its fabric.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">As the Paper Giant moved, the cloud garment flowed in tandem - embodying both the softness of drifting clouds and the sharpness of piercing needles!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Paper Giant's aura surged violently, its combat prowess exponentially increasing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin secretly instructed Ning Zhuo, "This is the Cloud Net Demonic Garment. Its white clouds serve as fabric, while Profound Needles form its essence. When gentle, it cascades like the Milky Way's silver stream; when enraged, it blankets the heavens with demonic energy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"To cultivate this technique, two key principles must be mastered:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"First, the Nine Transformations of the Cloud Sea: Gathering, Dispersing, Surging, Falling, Flowing, Condensing, Rupturing, Burning, and Annihilating. By channeling cloud intent into your meridians, the demonic garment can breathe life into the heavens. When struck, it absorbs massive forces like cotton; when counterattacking, it crushes enemies like a raging river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Second, manipulating demonic energy. By infusing any type of demonic energy into the cloud network, each strand can condense into a Profound Needle - razor-sharp and barbed like a hedgehog's quills, achieving perfect unity between offense and defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Little Zhuo, once you enter the Myriad Manifestations Sect, you may study the Cloud Chapter and Condensing Garment Art, then apply these principles with demonic energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"The Cloud Chapter states: 'Ride the righteous currents of the Nine Heavens' drifting clouds, let the ever-changing clouds manifest three thousand forms...'</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"The Condensing Garment Art contains a verse that says:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"With soul as shuttle, I draw the heavenly wind,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Extracting thunder fiends to weave my pattern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">A single thought summons clouds to veil golden halls,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">A thousand calamities guard the spiritual core."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">"So, the Cloud Net Demonic Garment is fundamentally not a spell, but a divine art! It merely employs fiendish energy, making it appear like a spell on the surface."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"The most crucial part is the Cloud Net Grand Canon, left behind by the ancient sage of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Cloud Demonic Daoist. He said: 'The Cloud Net is no net, but the manifestation of Heavenly Dao's compassion. The Demonic Garment is no garment, but the transformation of Heaven and Earth's inverted scales!' This single statement already reveals the core secret of the Cloud Net Demonic Garment!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Ning Zhuo unconsciously pricked up his ears, listening intently and committing every word to memory without missing a beat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">As the teachings continued, the Dead Bone Giant Spirit had already closed in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Under Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's control, the Paper Giant first met the attack by moving to the left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">It didn't dodge at all, countering attack with attack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">When the Dead Bone Giant Spirit's massive fist struck the Cloud Net Demonic Garment, it immediately triggered the flowing cloud layers to stretch and contract, guiding, diverting, and absorbing the enemy's tremendous force. In the end, only ten percent of the original power reached the Paper Giant's True Form, which then distributed the impact across its entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">On the Paper Giant's fists, the Cloud Net Demonic Garment had concentrated a large amount of fiendish energy Profound Needles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Two fists struck the Dead Bone Giant Spirit, shattering its skeletal frame like dry reeds. The Profound Needles pierced through the giant's bones effortlessly, followed by immense force that crushed the entire skeleton.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Both fists tore completely through the Dead Bone Giant Spirit's body, sending it staggering to the ground in critical condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">A fierce wind whipped at their backs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">The Paper Giant Colossus turned to evade, then seized the opportunity to counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">With a sweeping arm motion, the Demonic Needle shifted instantly to its forearm, slicing through the Dead Bone Giant Spirit's torso like a guillotine blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">The Vanguard General and other Nascent Soul cultivators stared in disbelief at this sight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">The Paper Giant Colossus's combat capabilities had undergone an astonishing transformation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">What exactly was happening here?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">The Paper Giant Colossus planted its foot on the Dead Bone Giant Spirit's head, grinding it into dust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">The Cloud Net Demonic Garment billowed around the colossus, white clouds swirling like a ceaseless river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Both sides of the battlefield turned to stare in awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">"Excellent!" Tie Guzheng exclaimed, delighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Yang Sanyan also let out a sigh of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">"Truly worthy of Little Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">"My Jiao Ma is the best!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Sun Lingtong and Qing Chi's faces lit up with joy, all traces of worry vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">The Paper Doll Clone's eyes flashed with lethal intent, forcing the four Golden Core Ghost Generals into a desperate struggle, their backs drenched in cold sweat as they narrowly avoided destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">The Paper Doll Clone seized the opening, repelling one of the generals and finally charging in to strike down the immobile Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">A Nascent Soul-level Ghost General intervened at the critical moment, blocking the Paper Doll Clone's path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">The Paper Doll Clone burned with fury!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">She knew that had been a high-grade opportunity. Missed now, it would likely never come again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">As expected, the Vanguard General also reacted, immediately dispatching reinforcements to support the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">Ning Zhuo's gaze turned toward the situation. "Mother, we should swiftly eliminate that Ghost Cultivator controlling the candle. Cut off their teleportation route!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">Ning Zhuo wanted to provide support, but Buddha Doctor - Meng Yaoyin said, "I need to conserve my strength, Little Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">"We've already suppressed the enemy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">"If I exert myself too much, my remaining conscious time will drastically shorten."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">"Don't worry about that. The City Lord's True Form will inevitably act!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">"You can begin preparing your spell to burn down this Paper Giant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">"Already?" Ning Zhuo exclaimed in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">In the next moment, the entire city shook as a flood surged forth. The Ink River roared, and the Yin Tide surged violently!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">The South City Gate suddenly closed, and the White Paper Immortal City began to ascend!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
