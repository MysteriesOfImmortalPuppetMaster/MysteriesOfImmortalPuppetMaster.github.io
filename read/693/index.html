<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The solid ice imprisoning Yuan Dasheng originated from a technique wielded by one of the Forbidden Army Commanders of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This ice wasn't merely of the Water Element; it also embodied the principles of Profound Yin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo could penetrate the ice using his Water Element mastery, but his understanding of Profound Yin remained limited. Consequently, he couldn't devise a spell to counter the ice based solely on the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Meanwhile, the Yellow Dust enveloping Meng Yehu's entire body, though of the Earth Element, stemmed from a Divided Spirit of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This meant it was no longer pure Earth Element, but retained the divine power of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Divided Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan couldn't shake this divine power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After all, it was merely a Magic Artifact, not a Magic Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo possessed the materials to craft a Magic Treasure, but his natal magical technique hadn't yet matured. Even with a Magic Treasure-grade vessel, it couldn't unleash the full power of a Magic Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In fact, the inherent potency of a Magic Treasure might interfere with and erode the talismanic imprints of his natal magical technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Only when Ning Zhuo's Three Dantian all reached the Golden Core-level could he possess a Lifebound Treasure, rather than his current Lifebound Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">With the Five Elements approach proving ineffective, Ning Zhuo examined his possessions, searching for a breakthrough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Buddha Heart Demon Seal had always resided within Ning Zhuo's divine sea, bringing him unexpected joy during the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts Battle and the Lord of the Forgetful River Battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">However, its rank was too high and its nature too mysterious for Ning Zhuo to truly control it yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"But as my cultivation level rises, the power of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal's passive counterattacks has also increased significantly. After all, it relies on my strength to function."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Magic Artifacts, Magic Treasures, Spirit Treasures, Dao Treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Based on its current performance, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal clearly lacks sufficient spiritual energy to qualify as a Spirit Treasure. It likely belongs to the highest tier of Magic Treasures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">There were vast differences even among Magic Treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Generally, Golden Core and Nascent Soul-level cultivators used Magic Treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The disparities between Magic Treasures mirrored the gulf between Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivatorsâ€”sometimes as vast as heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In terms of quality, the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat possessed greater spiritual energy and could be considered a quasi-Spirit Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo primarily used it to cultivate his Physical Body. This was largely thanks to the unorthodox methods developed by Sun Lingtong, which made the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat's body refinement techniques exceptionally efficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"I need to find an opportunity to repair the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat remained damaged, its surface riddled with cracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">In the past, Ning Zhuo lacked both the ability to repair the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat and the inclination, thinking, "I'll burn it eventually anyway, so as long as it works, there's no point in fixing it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">But now, Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin had explicitly instructed him in the Jade Slip message to preserve the Spirit Boat and not destroy it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">This completely altered Ning Zhuo's plans for the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Over the past few months, Ning Zhuo had used the Spirit Boat more than any other magic treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He had no choice; his physical body needed to be strengthened to withstand the immense pressure of the Million-Man Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">If left unchecked, this pressure would continuously damage his body due to the strain on his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Besides the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, he also used several other magic treasures for cultivation, including the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor, the Evil Ghost Reversal Cauldron, and the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Strictly speaking, the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor was a Military Treasure. Whenever Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong used it, they paired it with the High Victory Legacy, achieving remarkable results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">However, this cultivation method had a drawback: each stage of comprehension had to be fully mastered before progressing to the next. Otherwise, even if they gained some understanding, it would differ little from their previous insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Old Sun can move on to the next stage now," Ning Zhuo thought. "He's already fully grasped the Light Body Swift Wind Formation. But I'm still a ways behind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo had previously comprehended the Hero's Return Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This military strategy was exceptionally effective, far surpassing the Light Body Swift Wind Formation. Fully mastering it would still take some time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"While this strategy is powerful, it has its limitations. For instance, during the battle in the Forgetful River Prefecture, the Qing-Jiao Army suffered minimal losses, leaving me with no opportunity to gain any enhancements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"What I truly need is a Mechanical Army!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Securing this would be no easy task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo had successfully established an army once before, but the Qing-Jiao Army's creation had been a result of perfect timing, with the heavens and earth aligning and multiple forces lending their support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He had already emptied his coffers for that endeavor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Now, simply being the Qing-Jiao Army's deputy commander wouldn't allow him to integrate a Mechanical Army into its ranks. The army's established Military Seed already precluded such a possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Unless Ning Zhuo joined an army whose Military Seed recognized mechanical constructs, or, like in the Two Note Kingdom, directly enlisted in the national army, achieving his goal in one step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Hungry Ghost Reversal Cauldron was a soul-path magical treasure that could consume ghosts to produce Soul Essence in bulk. When combined with the other three treasures, it could significantly enhance one's Soul foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">In White Paper Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had used these treasures to elevate his Soul cultivation to the Million-Man Soul realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Currently, however, he couldn't use them. Ning Zhuo had temporarily halted his Soul cultivation to focus on strengthening his Physical Body foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">As for the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle, it was a Demon Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Only cultivators with demonic blood could truly unleash its power, making it incompatible with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">During a gamble of fate, Liu Er had been forced to gift this treasure to Ning Zhuo. Originally, Ning Zhuo had intended to explore the kettle's mysteries and devise a method for self-Dual Cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">However, upon arriving at White Paper Immortal City, he discovered that the current White Paper City Lord coveted this Demon Treasure far more than he did!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">In the future, Ning Zhuo planned to use this treasure to convert the White Paper City Lord's Yin Qi into Yang Qi. With this Yang Qi as leverage, the City Lord would have no choice but to comply with his demands, ensuring his inevitable success!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">This would serve as Ning Zhuo's ultimate trump card to control the White Paper City Lord, exert continuous influence over her, and even dominate the Ghostly Black Marshlands!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The remaining magic treasures included the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, the Golden Light Collar, the Azure-White Jade Ring, and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Great Primordial Dispersal Scale was a Legacy Treasure of the Profound Primordial Scholar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">It had first been seized by Luo Si, who then gifted it to Ning Zhuo. During the Black Cloud Battlefield, Ning Zhuo had comprehended the arrangements of Fate and used the scale to shatter the Yellow Dust Barrier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Great Primordial Dispersal Scale had played a crucial role in his success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">After the great battle in the Underworld Prefecture, Ning Zhuo attempted to refine the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, but was disappointed to find he had made absolutely no progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"I still haven't found the key," he mused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"The Profound Primordial Scholar was a Void Refinement-level powerhouse. His construction of the White Paper Immortal City, the legacy treasures he left behind, and his secret deployment of the Paper Person army must all serve a purpose."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo felt that unless he could decipher this purpose, he would never find the key to refining the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">For now, however, his status as Vice City Lord of the White Paper Immortal City allowed him to freely wield the treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Therefore, whether he could refine it or not was of little immediate consequence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">As for the Golden Light Collar and Azure-White Jade Ring, both were defensive magic treasures Ning Zhuo had acquired on the battlefield of the Two Note Kingdom, expending his accumulated war merits to obtain them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He hadn't needed them during the subsequent Lord of the Forgetful River Battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The reason was simple: even activating both treasures simultaneously wouldn't provide enough additional defense to withstand a single strike from his enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">During that great battle, Ning Zhuo had relied primarily on the Azure Iron Han Armor - Golden Swallow, leaping and dodging along the razor's edge between life and death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">It was only during his battle with Lin Jinglong that Ning Zhuo finally deployed the Azure-White Jade Ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">And it proved quite useful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lin Jinglong no longer used his magic treasures. Relying on the Azure-White Jade Ring, Ning Zhuo had become virtually invincible. No matter how Spring Thunder bombarded him, his body remained unshaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In addition to these defenses, he also possessed the Bone-Piercing Crocodile's stomach pouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Qing Yan had gifted Ning Zhuo the stomach pouch aboard the ship. Since it was made from Golden Core-level materials, the pouch itself qualified as a magic treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The stomach pouch was designed to enhance the foundation of one's soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">By projecting one's soul into the pouch, enduring its corrosive effects, and then recovering, one could greatly strengthen the soul's resilience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">However, the pouch had a limited number of uses, making this Golden Core-level magic treasure among the lowest tier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo had accepted it but never found time to use it. By the time he had the opportunity, he had already acquired Old Chef's Dark Cuisine and, shortly after, the Four Treasures of Soul Cultivation from the White Paper City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Compared to these, the stomach pouch's cultivation benefits paled in comparison. Ning Zhuo had never used it once, relegating it to the bottom of his storage chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Other unused items included the Dragon Qi Jade Pendant and the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo retrieved the Dragon Qi Jade Pendant, examined it briefly, and then put it away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"This was a gift from Li Xiangshang. It cracked when I ascended the Sacrificial Altar to seize the Innate Talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"It must have played a crucial role, providing me with immense assistance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"It's a pity that by the time I led the Qing-Jiao Army back to the Yang World, Li Xiangshang had already left White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"However, he's cultivating along the Cang River, serving under the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign. If the opportunity arises, I'll seek him out for a discussion. Perhaps I can uncover the true purpose of the jade pendant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">As for the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal, it was utterly useless to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Perhaps I could use it to trade with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord in the future?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"I'll wait and see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Unless the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord weakens to a critical point, I won't use this seal to bargain with him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Forgetful River Prefecture was currently under a full-scale assault from the Ghostfire Prefecture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo chose to observe the situation quietly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I can't allow the Ghostfire Prefecture to completely conquer the Forgetful River Prefecture. If they annex such a vast territory, their power will expand exponentially."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"The Ghostly Black Marshlands would then face not the relatively familiar Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, but the far more formidable Ghostfire Prefecture."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">This was not what Ning Zhuo wanted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">What he needed was for the Forgetful River Prefecture and the Ghostfire Prefecture to remain locked in a protracted war, these two colossal powers locked in a stalemate, bleeding resources and unable to spare attention for other matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Therefore, the opportunity to trade for the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal will only arise when the Forgetful River Prefecture is on the verge of collapse!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">After a thorough inventory, Ning Zhuo discovered he possessed over ten magic treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">This count included National Artifacts, Military Treasures, and similar items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In any case, the sheer number of magic treasures at this level far exceeded what a Foundation Establishment cultivator should possess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Let alone Foundation Establishment cultivators, even the vast majority of Golden Core cultivators would pale in comparison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Considering their quality, treasures like the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle, and the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal would make even Nascent Soul cultivators green with envy, jealousy, and resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">When calculating these assets, Ning Zhuo deliberately excluded mechanical constructs, or the total would have been even higher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Qi Bai alone carried four magic treasure-level mechanical components within his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Among mechanical constructs, Ning Zhuo used the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon most frequently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon had proven invaluable, especially during the Two Note Kingdom war, where it played a pivotal role.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon possessed numerous empty compartments, offering immense potential for upgrades. Had it fallen into ordinary hands, they would likely have poured their efforts into its continuous improvement, working day and night to enhance its capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">However, when the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon came into Ning Zhuo's possession, he only hastily upgraded it once while at the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, specifically for the Spirit Hidden Willow. After transplanting the willow, he merely maintained the vessel with minor repairs, neglecting further enhancements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo and Sun Ning were too preoccupied with their travels to spare the time or inclination for such endeavors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Now, however, as they prepared to relocate the contents of the Jade Cleansing Pavilion's Immortal Abode, the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon was undergoing its second round of upgrades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The Golden Core-level Mechanical Puppets included:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Buddha Physician Meng Yaoyin Heavy-Armored Blood Ape Dasheng Shadow Blade Night Tiger Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor * Azure Iron Han Armor - Golden Swallow</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Among these, Buddha Physician Meng Yaoyin wielded Strange Path techniques, granting her combat prowess rivaling that of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">In addition to these, there were:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Netherworld Envoy - Qi Bai Milk Butterfly Lady Mechanism Ring Floating Ice White Jade Hand * Weather Orb - Ice Crystal Snow</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Beyond these, there were mass-produced, mature mechanisms such as:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Blazing Monkeys Firewalking Snakes Thunder Silence Birds Golden Swallow Tridents</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Next came various mechanical components, such as the Up-and-Down Ruyi Cord, the Topknot-Fishing Death Whip, the Riveted Rapid-Fire Crossbow, the Hanging Ring, and the Half-Dead, Half-Alive Pearl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Many of the medicinal pills had been consumed by Ning Zhuo during his travels. The most valuable remaining item was the Nine Springs Tranquil Incense, one of the Four Treasures of Soul Cultivation from White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Spirit Food couldn't be stored for long, so there was a large quantity of Ice Jade Wine and a small amount of Bitter Cold True Water. The most valuable item was the Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine, another of the Four Treasures of Soul Cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">There were numerous talismans. The Three Palaces Interlocking Treasure Talisman had once been invaluable to Ning Zhuo, but it was no longer needed. The Slick and Smooth Talisman and the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman even contained traces of spiritual energy! The Directional Void Escape Talisman and the Substitute Talisman provided Ning Zhuo with greater margin for error.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"But during the Lord of the Wangchuan Battle, none of these talismans could be used."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"In truly high-level combat, these talismans are simply too low-grade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Only a few materials remained. Ning Zhuo had invested all the Heavenly Ghost's wealth into building the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">There were several Western Pure Lands, over a hundred Ghost Path Golden Cores, and a large pile of materials salvaged from disassembled magic treasures and Magic Artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Supreme Goodness Like Water and Fire Within Wood had already been used up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The Spirit Stone shortage was severe!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The most valuable item was the Stone Monster's corpse, but Ning Zhuo couldn't afford to use it. He might need it later to impersonate the Old Stone Monster in the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Among the materials, Ning Zhuo spotted thirteen stalks of Ghost Shadow Bamboo. He had originally planned to study Meng Yehu's design plans and keep the bamboo for future use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Now that Meng Yehu had fully adopted Golden Core-level materials, these Foundation Establishment-level Ghost Shadow Bamboo stalks were no longer useful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo had also gradually collected a small pile of books, including the Ice Sculpture Secret Manual, Collection of Serpentine Springing Array Formations, Yin Bone Manual, Netherworld Heart Sutra, Detailed Explanation of Soul Guiding Techniques, Minor Blood Demon Dissection Technique, Dead Moon's Offering Song, Great Celestial Burial Canon, the Jiao Family Jade Slip, the Myriad Manifestations Sutra (Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment chapters), the Chef Elder's Legacy, and more.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
