<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Beside the Branch of the Wangchuan River, Qing Chi knelt weakly, her head bowed, her sorrowful sobs revealing an unprecedented vulnerability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Her youthful days, that naive and tender joy, the secret sense of reliance like a budding flower, had vanished like a sand painting swept away by the wind, dissolving bit by bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The soul-deep bond of life and death they had shared, the vows that transcended mortality, the earth-shattering emotions of shared existence burned into her soul like a branding iron - all extinguished like a flame, leaving only a cold emptiness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">These were the memories of her past with her beloved, the essence of her understanding and experience of love, all sacrificed by Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">She had no choice. Only by doing this could she save her beloved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"I will rescue you, even if the price... is forgetting you, is no longer loving you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Yellow dust gradually enveloped Luo Si's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"I can't suppress it any longer?" His expression shifted slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">His prolonged battle against the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God had come at a terrible cost. The injuries he had been desperately suppressing finally erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This time, he was powerless to resist. He could only watch helplessly as his injuries worsened, gradually petrifying him into an earthen statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Yet his thoughts weren't on himself, but on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"This can't be happening!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"General Qing has sacrificed so much, willingly offering up so many memories as bait."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Why? Why can't we lure the Young Master out?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Luo Si was utterly bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This was a colossal misunderstanding!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo was playing the role of Jiao Ma, concealing his true identity, which had misled Luo Si. Qing Chi, meanwhile, had been mistaken from the start.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">How could she possibly lure Ning Zhuo using memories and feelings meant for Jiao Ma?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Damn it! We've already wasted so much time. If this continues, even if we manage to pull the Young Master ashore, he'll have lost all his memories, becoming a blank slate, a newborn child."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Thinking of this, Luo Si shouted, "Young Master! Why not voluntarily discard your memories? Lighten your burden and let General Qing pull you ashore!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">A cultivator's divine sense would be washed away and drowned in the Branch of the Wangchuan River, but their voice could still carry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Submerged in the river, Ning Zhuo's ears twitched slightly as he faintly heard Luo Si's desperate plea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Voluntarily forget?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"No, no..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Nothing can truly be forgotten. If I lose these memories, would I still be myself?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Forgetful River's waters sought to wash away his memories and emotions, while the Buddha Heart Demon Seal suppressed his soul, resisting the river's immense power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Memories and emotions surged forth, each one vivid and clear as never before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo refused to yield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"In Fire Persimmon Mountain, the plan to seize the Lava Immortal Palace is only half complete."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo seethed with hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"The enemies who killed my parents have yet to be found. I still have a great vengeance to exact!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo trembled with fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"If I forget the memories of my time with Mother, how will she ever be resurrected? I'm all she has left in this world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo clung to his memories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He recalled Sun Lingtong, his countless battles fought side-by-side with Big Brother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He remembered Linghu Jiu, the flower of friendship blooming in Ten Thousand Medicines Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He thought of Mu Lan, his nominal wife. In the Two Note Kingdom, rewards for his merits remained unclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He remembered the campaign against Thousand Peaks Forest, the earth-shattering Iron Tide Sweeping the Plains, a spectacle of unparalleled grandeur.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He recalled donning the Black Iron Han Armor, soaring through the void with Sun Lingtong like the wind, and challenging the Golden Eagle in a thrilling aerial duel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He thought of Zhu Xuanji, Ning Jiufan, Lin Shanshan, the Five Elements Divine Lord, Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei, and the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">When he thought of Qing Chi, the deepest, most hidden emotions within him finally surged forth, no longer concealed, laid bare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo... felt ashamed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"I'm not the real Jiao Ma. This is just a coincidence, or perhaps the Living Realm's Heaven's Qi Luck at work."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Qing Chi... I shouldn't have deceived her. But I never found the right moment to confess the truth!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"And... Mother..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">When Ning Zhuo saw the Paper Giant at the South City Gate of White Paper Immortal City, its face was his mother's. When he heard the City Lord of White Paper Immortal City, Wen Ruanyu, and others praise Meng Yaoyin, recounting her virtuous deeds and acts of kindness, Ning Zhuo felt - ashamed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"I'm my mother's child, yet I'm nothing like her. I haven't done any good deeds or acts of kindness. Even after leaving White Paper Immortal City for years, people still sing her praises and even erected a statue in her honor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"But I'm just a thief, a petty thief."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">What kind of existence was his mother to him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">She was countless gentle caresses, tender encouragement, heartfelt expectations, her dying wish, and even as a mechanism, she had protected him with all her might until her spiritual energy faded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"I will save my mother, even if her soul no longer exists in this world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"I will trace the remnants of her existence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"I desperately want to understand her, to know her better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"What kind of person was my mother, truly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">When Ning Zhuo arrived at White Paper Immortal City, he received the first answer to this question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Meng Yaoyin was the towering Paper Giant, a monument to White Paper Immortal City. Without her assistance, the city might have crumbled long ago. The unity between the Ghost-Human Tribe and the Humans was also a testament to her teachings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">To completely eradicate the city's crisis, she collaborated with the Ash Bone Elder, harnessing the power of the Profound Primordial Scholar. For decades, she had orchestrated a grand scheme to counter the variables of the Living Realm, becoming the true savior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Without a doubt, my mother was a hero!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"But the son of a hero... a thief? A petty thief?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The expectant gazes of Li Leifeng and Zhu Xuanji flashed before his eyes once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo was no longer the restrained youth he once was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">In the fruit orchards at the foot of Fire Persimmon Mountain, Fire Persimmons silently grew, drawing magma and geothermal energy, waiting for the moment they ripened and fell to the ground, ready to self-detonate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo had finally emerged from the Fire Persimmon Mountain within his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He was no longer that Fire Persimmon, enduring years of restraint, seeking only a fleeting moment of self-destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He had come to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, where he faced public scrutiny, skepticism, and praise, ultimately becoming a Divine Seed of the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He participated in the Two Note Kingdom war, where the strategic acumen of a Military Strategist nourished his seed, sweeping away narrow-mindedness and filling it with grandeur and valor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He had arrived at the Ghostly Black Marshlands, gazing up at the Colossus of his mother, accepting her and the Living Realm's Heaven's arrangements with gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He sought to follow in his mother's footsteps, driven by the deepest impulses of a child's heart to emulate his parents' actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"The son of a hero should no longer be a petty thief!" Overwhelmed with shame, he realized that the plan to become a savior was now within his grasp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">It was like a ray of sunlight striking a seed buried deep underground at the perfect moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This was an opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">A gift from fate, a plan orchestrated by his mother, Ning Zhuo's path to confronting his shame, and, most importantly, his redemption - a chance to stand tall, bask in the sunlight, and live with dignity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He had already escaped Fire Persimmon Mountain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He possessed the Five Elements realm, unwavering courage, a yearning for light, compassion for the suffering, and reverence for the virtuous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Like a seed sprouting, its tender shoot reaching for the sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">And so, Ning Zhuo threw himself into the vortex without hesitation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He outwitted the Internal Traitor, racking his brains to make the most correct choices possible. A single misstep could have led to a completely different outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He faced life-and-death perils, enduring countless trials, and exhausting every ounce of his strength to seize the smallest sliver of opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He finally ascended the Sacrificial Altar and claimed the Heavenly Ghost Skull!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He was swept away by a branch of the Wangchuan River, plunging into a desperate situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Such a being was no easy opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He was the ruler of a nation, a Soul Formation-level expert, the master of the Forgetful River Prefecture, and a cunning ghost who had plotted for centuries to advance his Dao Path!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Even though he had been plotted against, besieged from all sides, and forced to divide his attention, leaving him severely constrained, he had still managed to hold out until this final moment through his cunning, combat prowess, and unwavering will.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He had pushed himself to the absolute limit, fighting until his strength was utterly exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">His ancestral stronghold, Forgetful River Immortal City, was ablaze, and his Earth Fiend Turbid Corruption Avatar had crumbled...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The losses were catastrophic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Yet, with his final gambit, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord could still condemn Ning Zhuo to death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">And he wasn't the only one to suffer such devastating losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Soundless Ghost Monk, the Painted Skin Rakshasa, Lord Yin Jiuzhu of the Ghostfire Prefecture... and Luo Si, his entire body buried under yellow earth, was rapidly transforming into a clay statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He was completely immobilized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Qing Chi knelt on both knees, her hands gripping the fishing rod tightly, channeling all her memories and emotions related to Jiao Ma into the bait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Her heart felt like it was bleeding, forcing her to make the most agonizing decision of her life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"I must abandon my memories first, but preserve my feelings for Little Ma at all costs!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Even if... I completely forget Little Ma, this overwhelming love will drive me to persevere and pull him ashore!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Tears blurred Qing Chi's vision as she gazed at Ning Zhuo sinking into the depths, her voice breaking with sorrow as she cried out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Little Ma, Little Ma..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Come back quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Discard those useless memories and emotions, even ours..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"As long as you live, nothing else matters. Even if you forget me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, though far away in Forgetful River Immortal City, observed everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">His gaze remained fixed on Ning Zhuo in the tributary, while he exerted all his strength to manipulate the Nether Dragon Scissors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">A dark glint flashed in his eyes as he gained a new understanding: "You're too stubborn, Little Ghost, and too shallow. Do you think the Living Realm's Heaven sent you here merely to oppose me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"No, it's orchestrating you as well!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"The Forgetful River is the Sin-Washing River. Through my hand, it immerses you, cleansing your sins, allowing you to undergo Heart Cleansing and Reform, and attain a new life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo continued to resist the Forgetful River's relentless current with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Qing Chi, Luo Si..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He could hear Luo Si's cries and Qing Chi's anguished sobs, but he stubbornly refused to relax his grip even slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo hadn't truly refined the Buddha Heart Demon Seal; his Foundation Establishment cultivation was far from sufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He could only exert his full strength to support it and rely on the magic treasure's power, unable to control it with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He feared that if he loosened his grip even slightly, the pressure would spread like a ripple, causing a complete collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">And there was another reason...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Must I forget my past to become a hero?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Even if forgetting my past could truly erase my sins and grant me the right to start anew..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Even if that were true, I still wouldn't do it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Because even as a thief, that was still me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">That was my way of survival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">That was the path that led me here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">I will never deny my past, no matter how lowly, ugly, dark, or shameful it may be.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Buddha-Heart Demon Seal, give me the strength to endure!" Ning Zhuo's resolve remained unshaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">If this were the main current of the Forgetful River, he would have already resorted to other measures. But this was merely a branch, lacking the Prefecture Lord's support and replenishment - a rootless source.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Branches of the Forgetful River could be depleted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">It had already suffered significant losses battling the Ice Coffin within his body. Now, as it tried to wash away Ning Zhuo's memories, it was being further drained by the power of the Buddha-Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"I'd rather drain you dry!" Ning Zhuo's fighting spirit blazed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He wanted to be worthy of his mother and refused to forget any memory related to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">At that moment, his descent abruptly halted. The fishing hook pulled him upward, lifting his entire body a short distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Hmm?!" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's expression twisted in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Luo Si rejoiced. "The Fishing Technique is finally working!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Pain and sorrow no longer dominated Qing Chi's face; a flicker of joy had been added. "All the sacrifices... they were worth it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">It seemed the memories she had relinquished had finally caught up to the present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The memories of the White Paper Immortal City defense war were ones she had shared with Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo).</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">These memories were now affecting Ning Zhuo himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Qing Chi's joy vanished, replaced by a misty confusion in the depths of her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"Where... am I?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"What am I doing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Saving someone? Why am I saving him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Though she had lost all her memories, the emotions she had deliberately preserved remained potent and intense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Save him. I must save him, even if it costs me my life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">With a surge of strength, Qing Chi pulled Ning Zhuo slowly upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Forgetful River Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"You won't succeed!" the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord roared, his face twisted in a grimace of extreme tension, all traces of his usual composed demeanor as a ruler gone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ning Zhuo clutched the Heavenly Ghost Skull. If he were rescued because of it, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long plan would be utterly ruined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord would never allow that to happen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">He channeled every ounce of his spiritual energy into manipulating the Nether Dragon Scissors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">His prayer beads had been completely shattered, but the Ice Coffin in the Branch of the Wangchuan River had been reduced to a paper-thin layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's previous efforts had not been in vain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The Nether Dragon Scissors within the Ice Coffin had long been restless, its power radiating outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Had the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form been present, he could have easily reclaimed this National Treasure and beheaded Ning Zhuo and his petty thieves in one swift move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">But the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was currently far away in Forgetful River Immortal City. Even the forces he had dispatched to the Altar Battlefield at the first sign of trouble had yet to arrive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">He could only transmit his divine sense and spiritual energy through the Heaven-Connecting Earth-Linking Grand Formation, remotely activating the Nether Dragon Scissors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Though the Grand Formation was severely damaged, its core remained intact. The Altar Battlefield served as this core, allowing the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's influence to reach across the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">The Nether Dragon Scissors shuddered violently, emitting an eerie glow as it shattered the surrounding Ice Coffin and lunged toward Ning Zhuo, who was submerged in the branch of the Forgetful River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">"Damn it!" Luo Si cursed inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">His entire body was encased in thick clay, leaving only a trace of his original features visible on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Ning Zhuo didn't see the Nether Dragon Scissors approaching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">He had his back to the Ice Coffin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">In the Forgetful River's waters, divine sense was useless, unable to extend beyond the body. More accurately, it would be immediately washed away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Ning Zhuo was fully focused on maintaining the Buddha-Heart Demon Seal, leaving him no time to spare for anything else. He couldn't even manipulate Life Hanging by a Thread to send a single word of warning to Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">In that moment, he was nothing more than a fish on the chopping block, utterly at the mercy of his enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
