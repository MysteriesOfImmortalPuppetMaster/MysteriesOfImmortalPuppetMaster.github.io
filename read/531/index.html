<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 531: Where is my incense?!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
This domain of heaven and earth had been reconstructed by the Fire Element!<br/>
<br/>
The earth was scorched black and barren, and fierce flames burned everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
As the temperature rose higher and higher, everyone present was being seared and scorched by the raging flames every moment.<br/>
<br/>
And the most striking thing was that any living being, as long as it was in the Dao Field, would have a crown of flames upon its head.<br/>
<br/>
The flame crown rapidly consumed everyone’s spiritual energy, forcing each person’s state to be maintained at its peak.<br/>
<br/>
Flame Crown Dao Field!<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the Three Generals Battalion, a wave of uneasy agitation spread, and when they looked around, everyone wore a solemn expression.<br/>
<br/>
This was an unexpected development beyond anything mentioned in the intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
The situation was very bad!<br/>
<br/>
The Flame Crown Divine Fir had silently become a deity!<br/>
<br/>
Although its own level was not high, only at the Nascent Soul stage, this was its home turf.<br/>
<br/>
On its home turf, the strength of the Flame Crown Divine Fir expanded tremendously, becoming an almost invincible existence!<br/>
<br/>
“We must retreat first, as that is the safest option!” Liu Er, unwilling to stubbornly fight to the death, communicated his thoughts, and the other three eagerly discussed.<br/>
<br/>
“Impossible!” Guan Hong stroked his beard, casting a dangerous glance at the Flame Crown Divine Fir, “To retreat safely within a Dao Field is nearly impossible. At the very least, we have to inflict a heavy blow in order to find a good opportunity to retreat.”<br/>
<br/>
Even the impatient Zhang Hei had a solemn expression, and did not contradict the retreat proposal.<br/>
<br/>
He also knew well that fighting within the Dao Field would put the Three Generals Battalion at a significant disadvantage!<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er gritted his teeth: “For now, we could only act according to the situation.”<br/>
<br/>
As he said that, he secretly mobilized his innate talent in spirit resonance to probe, in order to quickly understand the Flame Crown Dao Field and find its weakness.<br/>
<br/>
Once the Dao Field was laid out, it would change the environment within a certain range, fully manifesting the understanding of the Dao outwardly.<br/>
<br/>
The master within the field would have their strength reach its peak.<br/>
<br/>
And enemies within the field would have their lives under great threat. But at the same time, by personally experiencing and coming into contact with the Dao, they would quickly increase their understanding of the principles expounded by the field!<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s talent in spirit resonance probing was not particularly suited for reconnaissance, but it was perfectly aligned with understanding in this regard.<br/>
<br/>
And there was also Ning Zhuo, who harbored a similar idea to his.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s specific idea was: to quickly increase his understanding by leveraging his own Fire Path realm, in order to catch a glimpse of a flaw.<br/>
<br/>
“The flame crown above my head enabled my ability to think and comprehend to be maintained at its peak.”<br/>
<br/>
“That was an unexpected delight!”<br/>
<br/>
Compared to Ning Zhuo, Luo Chen’s mood was much worse.<br/>
<br/>
To be precise, it was utterly terrible!<br/>
<br/>
He had originally planned to retreat, but ended up being blocked, and even had a new flame crown placed upon him.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, Luo Chen was very envious of the captured Yan Jin.<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin’s status and the constraints upon him were far lower than Luo Chen’s.<br/>
<br/>
But Luo Chen had no choice. He had been appointed as the forest chief of the Ten Li Burning Forest, and he was bound by the divine decree of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.<br/>
<br/>
So, even though he was very displeased with the attitude of the Flame Crown Divine Fir towards him, as well as its actions, he could only stand with the Flame Crown Divine Fir, and once again clash with the Three Generals Battalion!<br/>
<br/>
Boom, boom, boom……<br/>
<br/>
Luo Chen’s offensive was several times more ferocious than before!<br/>
<br/>
The entire Three Generals Battalion also received the blessing of the flame crown, and their combat strength soared.<br/>
<br/>
Both sides exchanged blows, fighting for nearly ten rounds, locked in a stalemate.<br/>
<br/>
Each of the three generals sustained injuries, and the casualties among their subordinates increased.<br/>
<br/>
As for Luo Chen, he was sweating profusely, and no longer possessed even a trace of his previous grace.<br/>
<br/>
Every strike they made was maintained at its peak level; the presence of the flame crown forced them to exert their utmost in offense and defense, which easily led both sides in the battle to feel exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
“At this rate, even before defeating the enemy, I will be drained.”<br/>
<br/>
“Divine Fir, remove my flame crown first!”<br/>
<br/>
After a long and bitter battle, Luo Chen once again transmitted his divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
In return, he received the cold snort and rejection from the Flame Crown Divine Fir: “Luo Chen, perform well. Do you think I don't know your intentions?”<br/>
<br/>
“You have to exert yourself properly, so that in the future I won't not have to defy you in front of the Dragon King!”<br/>
<br/>
The Flame Crown Divine Fir was perceptive and well-versed in human affairs.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Chen was so angry that he ground his teeth, yet he had no way to deal with the Flame Crown Divine Fir.<br/>
<br/>
Hidden in the shadows, Gao Cuo also wore a worried expression: “Old Sword, we are now trapped in the Flame Crown Dao Field as well.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Flame Crown Divine Fir has already detected us long ago, yet it has not provoked us.”<br/>
<br/>
“Tell me, if I make a move under your cover, will it expose my identity?”<br/>
<br/>
Old Sword pondered: “It's hard to say.”<br/>
<br/>
“This Flame Crown Divine Fir, though it only stood in one place, encountered too many people every day, all of them of various kinds.”<br/>
<br/>
“Those cultivators who came to the Ten Li Burning Forest, before refining their artifacts, would all pray beneath the trees, begging for a flame crown. These incense offerings also contributed to this deity’s rather thorough understanding of worldly affairs.”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo clenched his fists: “So, we can only continue to observe like this?”<br/>
<br/>
He was extremely unwilling, but also helpless.<br/>
<br/>
His situation was actually the same as Luo Chen’s; Gao Cuo had once been the mountain chief of the Azure Sky Mountain, and naturally was also bound by the divine decree of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.<br/>
<br/>
With such constraints, once his identity was exposed, it would inevitably lead to extreme disadvantages.<br/>
<br/>
Just the fact of why he had sneaked into the Ten Li Burning Forest, he could not explain to others.<br/>
<br/>
However, Lin Bufan was not encompassed by the Flame Crown Dao Field.<br/>
<br/>
When the Flame Crown Divine Fir appeared, he immediately soared on his cloud, avoiding the coverage of the field.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, Lin Bufan looked down upon the field, feeling deeply worried.<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo……”<br/>
<br/>
“You stinking brat, I still have to wipe your butt.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan cast his gaze towards Ning Zhuo, while in his heart he constantly calculated whether, if he acted with full force, it could turn the situation around.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan continuously assessed the true combat strength of the Flame Crown Divine Fir, and did not hastily make a move.<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it, damn it! Why hadn’t you all died yet?!”<br/>
<br/>
Luo Chen angrily scolded the Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
He had completely lost his grace, all because the flame crown continued to burn, having already burned through his magical power, and was scorching his body, his vital essence, and his divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
If it continued to burn like this, even if he won, he would suffer a crushing defeat and loss.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Chen stepped within a small area, with starlight shimmering around him.<br/>
<br/>
The deep blue starlight was dazzling, quickly coalescing into seven faint stars in the sky above the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, this was the Flame Crown Dao Field; to be able to strongly display stars within this field already showed the power of this spell.<br/>
<br/>
“Is this the Seven Stars Step?” Liu Er observed for a moment and blurted out.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Chen let out a light shout, and the stars twisted the firelight, continuously shooting down.<br/>
<br/>
Bang, bang, bang……<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion gave their all, defending with difficulty.<br/>
Although 80% of their military strength was consumed, they only blocked five of the stars.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining 20% was firmly held by Liu Er, used solely to empower the soldiers’ defenses.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the remaining two stars shot into the ranks, exploding among the crowd.<br/>
In an instant, starlight spread in all directions, killing nearly two hundred soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
The previously tight formation of the Three Generals Battalion quickly yielded two large gaps.<br/>
<br/>
Guan and Zhang both felt that their hearts were willing but their strength was insufficient.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s ears were bleeding, as he had never before mobilized his innate talent with such full effort; although he reaped a large amount, it was still far from enough to completely probe the field.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was also full of unwillingness: “My Fire Path realm is sufficient, but the field also contained the Dao of deities.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I could contemplate it without interference, fully immersing myself, perhaps there would be further progress.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I could use the Life-Hanging-by-a-Thread divine ability to connect with the Flame Crown Divine Fir, perhaps there would be a major breakthrough! What I lack most is a closer connection with the Dao field!”<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, Ning Zhuo was merely indulging in wishful thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Although he had mastered the Life-Hanging-by-a-Thread divine ability, this technique was at most suited for Golden Core cultivators; Nascent Soul cultivators could not employ it.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, some individual cultivators also could not.<br/>
<br/>
For example, Linghu Jiu, and also Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er did not know that Ning Zhuo was also attempting the same thing as him.<br/>
<br/>
The two of them, working together, could complement each other, but the key was that they both kept it a secret.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion fell into crisis.<br/>
<br/>
As Luo Chen launched his frenzied assault, the Three Generals Battalion was plummeting into the abyss of defeat.<br/>
<br/>
“Could it be that my Yan Jin was going to lose his life here!?”<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin had watched the battle for a long time, and then transmitted his divine sense: “Three old men, and this young hero as well, why not let me go.”<br/>
<br/>
“I would go plead with Luo Chen; perhaps the situation might still change.”<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin saw that the situation was getting increasingly bad; if the Three Generals Battalion were to be defeated, he, as a captive, would be the first to lose his life.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention that if Luo Chen, with his cultivation greatly diminished, were to face Yan Jin, what state of mind he would be in; for the Three Generals Battalion alone, when facing their own defeat, would not refrain from delivering a fatal blow to Yan Jin.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Yan Jin spoke up on his own behalf in advance, trying his best to secure a chance to survive.<br/>
<br/>
Who would want to die?<br/>
<br/>
To Yan Jin, Thousand Peaks Forest was merely a place beyond the law, where one could live and cultivate freely, without the usual constraints of national laws and city regulations.<br/>
<br/>
He did not worship the Dragon King, and his role as a great craftsman in the Burning Forest was also for his own cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
It was precisely because of this that, even while being captured, he heeded Liu Er’s advice to try to dissuade Luo Chen at the front lines.<br/>
<br/>
Everything had been about to be accomplished, but then the Flame Crown Divine Fir appeared, completely ruining his good fortune!<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er had no choice but to try one last desperate measure: “I would not let you go first; you must persuade Luo Chen. If this burning continued, even if he won, he would still suffer injuries, or even lose too much and die.”<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin, with no other option, had to transmit his divine sense to plead.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Chen responded violently: “How could I possibly betray the Dragon King? You bunch of people should all die, should all be killed! You all, go die quickly!!”<br/>
<br/>
Luo Chen was filled with extreme hatred, wishing nothing more than for everyone in the Three Generals Battalion, including Yan Jin, to perish in the next moment.<br/>
<br/>
Just as his response ended, the cold laughter of the Flame Crown Divine Fir came through: “Very well, Luo Chen, you performed well; this was the awareness that the forest chief of the Ten Li Burning Forest should have.”<br/>
<br/>
“Flame Crown Divine Fir, you…” Luo Chen gritted his teeth, harboring the same resentment towards the Flame Crown Divine Fir.<br/>
<br/>
However, he was not worried that the Flame Crown Divine Fir would go back on its word; since the latter had been secretly nurtured by the Dragon King, it was naturally also bound by a divine decree, and would not arbitrarily harm a Daoist companion from their side.<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin, having been rejected by Luo Chen, wore a face of utter despair: “My life is over.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned, not wanting him to disturb morale, and immediately said: “We still have hope!”<br/>
<br/>
In response, he was met with Yan Jin’s burst of cursing; he was almost driven mad by the pressure of impending death: “Not a damn hope! If I were to die, then you all would also have to die. Just Luo Chen alone made you utterly miserable, not to mention the Flame Crown Divine Fir.”<br/>
<br/>
“He has not even made a move until then.”<br/>
<br/>
“Even if you defeated Luo Chen, how are you going to deal with him?”<br/>
<br/>
“Although he has always concealed his identity, the public incense offerings were absolutely plentiful. Do you know how popular the Ten Li Burning Forest was?”<br/>
<br/>
“Every cultivator who came to refine artifacts provided him with an incense offering. The incense was like an ocean, available for him to call upon at any time, catalyzing divine power!”<br/>
<br/>
“You absolutely can not win!!”<br/>
<br/>
The desperate Yan Jin vented his emotions.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo’s eyes suddenly lit up: “Wait, what did you say?”<br/>
<br/>
“What did I say? We are going to die! I will be buried along with you all!!” Yan Jin roared at Ning Zhuo through divine sense transmission.<br/>
<br/>
Smack.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gave him a fierce slap, almost knocking his head askew: “Mind your status, captive.<br/>
<br/>
If you continued to shout at me, I wouldn’t mind sending you to the Underworld first.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, no, scattering your soul and spirit is a trivial matter I can also manage, don’t worry.”<br/>
<br/>
Yan Jin immediately fell silent, his cheeks quickly swelling red, and his gaze filled with repressed anger stared at Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
The words that Yan Jin had just spoken inadvertently gave Ning Zhuo an extremely significant reminder.<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, I have thought of a way to break out of this predicament!” Ning Zhuo immediately conferred with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had already been in strict formation at the Dragon Head Chamber: “There are many ways. For example, using the Ten-Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to traverse the void. Or, waiting for Lin Bufan to make a move, so that we can coordinate internally and externally.”<br/>
<br/>
“It is not difficult for us to escape; the main issue was that those soldiers will probably all perish.”<br/>
<br/>
“If the Three Generals Battalion approached complete annihilation, Liu, Guan, Zhang, and you, Ning Zhuo, would inevitably be merged into another army.”<br/>
<br/>
“The results of our painstaking nurturing and management would have turned into bubbles in the water.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo replied: “No, I have another method. I needed you, boss, to cooperate with me!”<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo explained in detail, Sun Lingtong immediately furrowed his brows, deeply worried: “That is indeed a method. But if I act alone, and if you encounter danger on your side, what then?”<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, this is war; how can I not take risks?” Ning Zhuo replied dismissively, “Moreover, Lin Bufan is watching over me from above.”<br/>
<br/>
"You're the key to breaking this deadlock, it all hinges on you now, Boss!"<br/>
<br/>
“If we let Lin Bufan come to our rescue, with his shrewdness in running the Myriad Medicine Sect, he would definitely charge exorbitantly for it.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth: “Fine, I will go and return quickly.”<br/>
<br/>
At the next moment, Ning Zhuo shouted, unleashing a series of Five Elements spells, trying his best to conceal his secret actions.<br/>
<br/>
He secretly extracted a part of his body and handed it over to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, riding the Ten-Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, with a gentle swing of its tail, shuttled down to the depths of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
He roamed around underground for a few circles, and discovered an underground divine temple, in which the deity statue was none other than the Flame Crown Divine Tree.<br/>
<br/>
Within the deity statue, a massive amount of incense was accumulated.<br/>
<br/>
“Next, just watch my thievery art!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong performed his thievery art, stealing a large amount of incense.<br/>
<br/>
He chuckled triumphantly: “Luckily, the ‘Void’ mark absorbed the Void Demonic God's bone marrow; otherwise, based on my previous level, the moment I acted, I would have been discovered by the Flame Crown Divine Fir.”<br/>
<br/>
“That's about enough; the Three Generals Battalion is about to be defeated.” Old Sword said to Gao Cuo.<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo nodded, without any rebuttal.<br/>
<br/>
The situation had already become quite clear; the soldiers of the Three Generals Battalion also realized the outcome of defeat, their morale plummeted, further reducing their military strength, making the situation even worse for the Three Generals.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Lin Bufan was stirring restlessly in the clouded sky.<br/>
<br/>
He began secretly formulating spells, preparing to rescue Ning Zhuo at any moment.<br/>
<br/>
However, just when Luo Chen believed that victory was imminent, the Flame Crown Divine Fir suddenly let out a piercing roar, revealing utmost anger and fear.<br/>
<br/>
The Flame Crown Dao Field then dissipated in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
And the Ten-Thousand Li Traversing Dragon had already, in the previous moment, silently returned to Ning Zhuo’s waist.<br/>
<br/>
“Hehehe. I stole all your incense; I wondered what else you have that can be converted into divine power?” Sun Lingtong, with his hands on his hips, was beaming with pride.<br/>
<br/>
“My incense, I had so much incense, didn’t I?!”<br/>
<br/>
“You stole my incense!”<br/>
<br/>
“A bunch of thieves, despicable and shameless!!” the Flame Crown Divine Fir roared, overcome with anger.</div>
