<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
A difficult beast battle had just ended.<br/>
<br/>
The young Yuan Yi and the young Yuan Dasheng walked through a deserted alley.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng was covered in wounds, each step he took tugged at his injuries, causing him to grimace in pain.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Yi clutched his pocket, which contained his last three and a half spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
Gritting his teeth, he finally said, "Dasheng, you stay here first. I'll go to the pharmacy over there and at least get you some ointment!" Yuan Yi left, and Yuan Dasheng staggered, leaning against the cold wall, slowly sitting down.<br/>
<br/>
He panted heavily, the act of sitting down also tugging at his wounds, making his heart race with pain.<br/>
<br/>
The alley was empty, the light dim, as if the world had shrunk to just him.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a gong sounded.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng instinctively looked up; the sound came from the courtyard opposite.<br/>
<br/>
Then, a drumbeat followed, and a host's voice rang out, "Next, we invite Lord Li Leifeng to perform a puppet show for the old family head. The play is titled 'Qin Lie Goes to Battle'!"<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, a mechanical platform slowly rose, and various puppets, dazzling and intricate, began their performance.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng looked up, through the gaps in the trees, watching the puppets move and speak like real people, fighting and fleeing, creating a lively scene.<br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng's manipulation skills were exquisite, and amidst the gongs, drums, zithers, and bells, Yuan Dasheng gradually forgot his pain, becoming engrossed in the show.<br/>
<br/>
The play progressed, reaching its climax.<br/>
<br/>
The villain set a trap, falsely accusing Qin Lie of holding troops for personal gain and harboring treacherous intentions. The young lord issued three imperial edicts in succession, disregarding the fact that the old General Qin Lie was severely injured, insisting that he charge into battle.<br/>
<br/>
The old General Qin Lie, with three battle flags inserted into the back of his chariot, struggled to his feet, lifted his long spear, and step by heavy step, headed towards the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
He sang:<br/>
<br/>
"Since childhood, I was nurtured by the former lord, his grace as vast as a mountain engraved in my heart. He taught me loyalty and righteousness to protect the land, imparted wisdom and courage to establish the world."<br/>
<br/>
"The former lord's grace, like a father and brother, allowed me to grow, teaching loyalty and righteousness, bestowing wisdom and courage..."<br/>
<br/>
The gong sounded steady and powerful, as if announcing the weight and tragedy of this battle.<br/>
<br/>
He sang again:<br/>
<br/>
"The young lord is young, I support him with all my heart, like a father and brother, I give my all. Though slandered, my heart holds no resentment, only wishing for the nation to stand firm forever."<br/>
<br/>
"The young lord is small, I support you to ascend the throne, like nurturing a sapling, hoping you become a forest. Though slandered, my heart holds no resentment, only wishing for the nation to revive..."<br/>
<br/>
The jinghu emitted a high-pitched, clear sound, sometimes mournful, tugging at the heartstrings; sometimes melodious, expressing Qin Lie's certain expectations.<br/>
<br/>
Old General Qin Lie charged into the battlefield like a lion, killing enemies left and right, causing heads to roll and the enemy to tremble in fear.<br/>
<br/>
He sang:<br/>
<br/>
"Though old in body, my spirit remains undiminished, shedding blood on the battlefield to repay the nation's grace. The former lord's spirit smiles in the heavens, I have no regrets going to battle."<br/>
<br/>
The drum sounded, thick and powerful, like galloping warhorses, grand and majestic. Yuan Dasheng watched, his blood boiling!<br/>
<br/>
Qin Lie fought tirelessly, his injuries worsening and his stamina depleted. Ultimately, he fell on the battlefield, unable to break through the thick enemy lines despite his efforts to charge and rescue.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing his fate was sealed, Qin Lie raised his head and sang:<br/>
<br/>
"The former lord's grace is forever remembered, my heart is tied to the young lord's revival. Shedding blood on the battlefield is not in vain, my soul returns to comfort the former lord. What fear do I have of the enemy, a thousand troops and horses are not to be feared!"<br/>
<br/>
"My death is not for fame or fortune, but for pure loyalty. Remembering the former lord's heavy grace, how can I retreat in the face of national peril?"<br/>
<br/>
"Young lord, I hope you understand, a loyal minister has no regrets in sacrificing his life. After my death, I wish you to know, my loyal heart and red courage protect the kingdom." The rhythm of the drums changed multiple times, reflecting both the intense tension of battle and the tragic grandeur of farewell.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Qin Lie and the enemy general nearly perished together.<br/>
<br/>
In his final moments, he faced the direction of the capital, half-kneeling on the ground, clasping his hands in salute: "My lord, your humble servant is leaving!" A heavy drumbeat echoed across the entire stage.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the suona sounded, its high and resonant notes filled with tragic grandeur, piercing through time and space, striking Yuan Dasheng's heart directly.<br/>
<br/>
The suona continued for a moment, then the sound of a flute joined in. The flute's notes were crisp and pleasant, sometimes winding and low, sometimes high and spirited.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the sound soared, like a bluebird flying into the sky, its distant figure gradually disappearing into the vast blue heavens.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng looked up, speechless for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
It was his first time watching this puppet show, and he could already understand human speech, deeply moved in both body and mind.<br/>
<br/>
"Da Ti, Da Sheng!" Yuan Yi ran back, holding several patches of ointment in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
He smiled and said, "Good luck, the pharmacy was clearing out, and I got a good deal, managed to get a few extra patches of ointment. Come, let me apply them for you."<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng let Yuan Yi treat his wounds, looking at Yuan Yi and then at the puppets on the high stage. The lantern light, like fire, reflected on his face, while the sounds of celebration and applause from the crowd on the other side of the wall constantly echoed in his ears.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go, why are you still sitting there?" Yuan Yi stood up and took a step.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng reached out, pointing to the high stage opposite.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Yi turned to look, indifferent: "Oh, it's a puppet show." Yuan Yi glanced again: "It's the Qin Lie Battle Song, a very famous piece. It's a pity he followed the wrong person."<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Yi walked ahead, and Yuan Dasheng followed behind him.<br/>
<br/>
As they walked out of the alley, he turned back for one last look at the mechanical stage.<br/>
<br/>
The stage was slowly descending, the puppet playing the old general Qin Lie still half-kneeling.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng looked at Yuan Yi's back and suddenly made a few "ah ah" sounds.<br/>
<br/>
I turned my head in confusion, glanced at Yuan Dasheng, not understanding what it wanted to say, and simply waved my hand: "Let's go quickly, go home and fill our stomachs, and sleep early!"<br/>
<br/>
Depending on each other for survival, fighting beasts, Monkey Head Gang.<br/>
<br/>
"Look, Dasheng, this is my child, he is my child!" Yuan Yi exclaimed with joy, "I have a child now, I have descendants in this world." "I named him Yuan Er. Dasheng, my life is not as long as yours." "If one day I'm no longer here, let Yuan Er take my place and continue to accompany you."<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er was hungry and started crying.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng squeezed the juice out of a peach the size of a washbasin and poured it over him. As a result, Yuan Er was drenched like a drowned rat.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er fell ill.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng moved like the wind through the Immortal City at night, rushed into the medical hall, grabbed the pharmacist by the neck, and dragged him along, flying and leaping, the pharmacist's screams breaking the tranquility of the moonlit night.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er began to climb.<br/>
<br/>
He clung to Yuan Dasheng's thick monkey fur, challenging the heights, and every time he fell, he was caught precisely by Yuan Dasheng's palm.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er could walk and jump.<br/>
<br/>
"Uncle Monkey, they bullied me!" Yuan Er brought Yuan Dasheng to seek justice, scaring the other children into wetting themselves and crying in despair.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er began to be brave and aggressive, curious about one thing: "Uncle Monkey, who is stronger, you or my dad? Have you ever fought? I asked my dad, but he never answers me." Yuan Er ran to Yuan Dasheng, his face full of admiration and excitement: "Uncle Monkey, you are so powerful, so fierce, when can I be like you?"<br/>
<br/>
"Dad, I heard you want to find a demonic cultivation technique for Uncle Monkey? Don't do that!" Yuan Er burst into the study, shouting.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Yi's face turned iron-like, and he angrily shouted: "Shut up, who has been filling your ears with nonsense again?"<br/>
<br/>
"Dad, Uncle Monkey's strength is already unmatched. Those monkeys and their descendants, calling them pets is inaccurate; they are the true masters. Those cultivators are merely slaves responsible for feeding them." "The situation is already like this, if Uncle Monkey's strength leaps further, it will be even worse." "By then, who will the Monkey Head Gang belong to?" Yuan Er pleaded bitterly.<br/>
<br/>
Separated by a few houses, Yuan Dasheng, who possessed demonic skills, heard every word.<br/>
<br/>
Its brows drooped, no longer lying down, but crouching on the ground, looking down, and letting out whimpering sounds.<br/>
<br/>
The monkeys and their descendants were killed, Yuan Dasheng extended a finger and lightly tapped Yuan Er's chest.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er survived the assassination attempt, Yuan Dasheng injured his own soul to protect him.<br/>
<br/>
During the explosion at the Fire Persimmon Festival, Yuan Dasheng shielded Yuan Er in his embrace.<br/>
<br/>
On his deathbed, Yuan Dasheng extended his finger one last time. In a daze, he seemed to hear the melody of "Qin Lie Goes to Battle."<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er was dead.<br/>
<br/>
After a brief period of chaos, the Monkey Head Gang was quickly stabilized by an elder who ascended to power and restored order.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng was also dead!<br/>
<br/>
This was Ning Zhuo's strongest feeling.<br/>
<br/>
He retrieved the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng and repaired the entire mechanism, but he couldn't find any trace of its spirit, as if it had never existed.<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Laoda's secret mark in the well remains unchanged."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo clenched his fists. Every time he wanted to personally investigate Sun Lingtong's situation, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his Divine Sea would flare up, emitting dazzling Buddhist light.<br/>
<br/>
My Buddha saves himself!<br/>
<br/>
The precious seal warned!<br/>
<br/>
It cautioned Ning Zhuo that if he took action, he would fall into someone else's trap.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's face turned ashen.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at Sun Lingtong, finding it hard to believe that someone could withstand his Soul Punishment!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's hands and legs were nailed with coffin nails, his entire body pinned to a pillar.<br/>
<br/>
His brows were tightly furrowed, his eyes rolled back, and due to some spell's torment, his body would occasionally twitch.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the torture, Cheng Bai gained nothing.<br/>
<br/>
To maintain his role as the investigating judge, he had to expend more and more soul power and magic.<br/>
<br/>
On any other day, he might have stopped torturing Sun Lingtong. After all, torturing Sun Lingtong to extract information about Chuitiao Guest was merely to lure out Han Ming.<br/>
<br/>
It was a losing deal.<br/>
<br/>
But in the Tiger Battle Fate Arena, Cheng Bai's desire to win was especially fierce.<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps his collapse is just a moment away!" Cheng Bai roared with a sinister expression, "Very well, I like your kind of stubbornness.<br/>
<br/>
"Next, you will endure ten times the pain from before!" "Hehehe."<br/>
<br/>
"Death would be a blessing for you. Unfortunately, you angered me." Cheng Bai activated a spell, striking Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt as if mountains were crushing him, the pain so intense that he hallucinated his body and soul being ground to dust by the mountains.<br/>
<br/>
Boundless pain seeped into every inch of his skin, yet he couldn't lose consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
He was like a small boat, tossed in a storm, falling into an endless ocean whirlpool.<br/>
<br/>
Past memories shone like a beam of light, weak yet stubborn, persisting in this boundless darkness.<br/>
<br/>
All of this was about Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Others can learn to control the black market, why can't we?" "Interesting, let's unite as brothers and take control of the black market!"<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, don't reveal your true face. Use the Blue Iron Armor to disguise yourself. As for me, I'm already well-known, it doesn't matter." Ning Zhuo smiled and changed his address, "From now on, I'll just call you Boss Sun!"<br/>
<br/>
"Boss, the goods are not right." "Boss Sun, I'm right behind you." "Boss, charge!"<br/>
<br/>
"Boss Sun, don't worry, I'll always follow you." The intense pain engulfed Sun Lingtong like a vast ocean.<br/>
<br/>
He opened his eyes, and the once lively eyes were now filled with blood.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong let out a tragic smile, knowing that the effect of the Void Seal was limited, and he could hardly hold on.<br/>
<br/>
He resolutely activated his last resort!<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai keenly noticed the anomaly and was shocked, "What? You're actually destroying your own soul!" Sun Lingtong triggered the Void Seal, attacking his own soul to resist Cheng Bai's soul search.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's eyes widened in disbelief, "Who exactly is that Chui Xu Ke to you? You're willing to let your soul scatter to protect him?!" "Are you really from the Void Sect? Are you still a waste cultivator?!" "Could it be that he is your fellow disciple? The Holy Son of your Void Sect?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hehe." Sun Lingtong grinned, struggling to let out his last laugh, "He's not my fellow disciple, he's my brother."<br/>
<br/>
"Brother?" Cheng Bai was even more puzzled, "Aren't brothers meant to be betrayed? For a bit of information, you're willing to give up your life? What exactly do you want?" Sun Lingtong lowered his eyelids, too weak, his voice very faint, "I... I just want to prove... he didn't... follow the wrong person." Cheng Bai tilted his ear to listen, and this was what he heard.<br/>
<br/>
"Incomprehensible!" Cheng Bai was furious to the extreme.<br/>
<br/>
In his entire life, he had never been so angry!<br/>
<br/>
He felt deeply violated.<br/>
<br/>
He completely lost his patience.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, he forgot about subduing Han Wu, forgot about Chui Xu Ke.<br/>
<br/>
He pointed his fingers like a sword and fiercely stabbed towards Sun Lingtong's forehead.<br/>
<br/>
This stab would surely pierce through Sun Lingtong's forehead, causing true death!<br/>
<br/>
Boom!!!<br/>
<br/>
An explosion suddenly occurred.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai sneered coldly, completely disregarding everything, determined to kill Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, the formation patterns appeared, firmly protecting Sun Lingtong and blocking the fatal blow.<br/>
<br/>
A violent explosion surged forth, accompanied by a torrent of scorching flames.<br/>
<br/>
The explosion swept Cheng Bai away, subsequently engulfing him.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, Sun Lingtong, under the protection of the formation patterns, was transported out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, he landed beside an old man.<br/>
<br/>
This old man was decrepit, his face weathered, with dark purple bags under his eyes and deep wrinkles that could trap insects.<br/>
<br/>
His hair was a disheveled black mess, spreading from the top of his head to his shoulders, hanging down to his feet like a large black cloak.<br/>
<br/>
He held a cane, his waist and back hunched severely, his entire posture bent like a lobster.<br/>
<br/>
He called himself Chui Xu Ke.<br/>
<br/>
He was Sun Lingtong's... brother!</div>
