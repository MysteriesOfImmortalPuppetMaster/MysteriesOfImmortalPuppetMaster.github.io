<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">A difficult beast battle had just ended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The young Yuan Yi and the young Yuan Dasheng walked through a deserted alley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Yuan Dasheng was covered in wounds, each step he took tugged at his injuries, causing him to grimace in pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Yuan Yi clutched his pocket, which contained his last three and a half spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Gritting his teeth, he finally said, "Dasheng, you stay here first. I'll go to the pharmacy over there and at least get you some ointment!" Yuan Yi left, and Yuan Dasheng staggered, leaning against the cold wall, slowly sitting down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He panted heavily, the act of sitting down also tugging at his wounds, making his heart race with pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The alley was empty, the light dim, as if the world had shrunk to just him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Suddenly, a gong sounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Yuan Dasheng instinctively looked up; the sound came from the courtyard opposite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Then, a drumbeat followed, and a host's voice rang out, "Next, we invite Lord Li Leifeng to perform a puppet show for the old family head. The play is titled 'Qin Lie Goes to Battle'!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The next moment, a mechanical platform slowly rose, and various puppets, dazzling and intricate, began their performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Yuan Dasheng looked up, through the gaps in the trees, watching the puppets move and speak like real people, fighting and fleeing, creating a lively scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Li Leifeng's manipulation skills were exquisite, and amidst the gongs, drums, zithers, and bells, Yuan Dasheng gradually forgot his pain, becoming engrossed in the show.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The play progressed, reaching its climax.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The villain set a trap, falsely accusing Qin Lie of holding troops for personal gain and harboring treacherous intentions. The young lord issued three imperial edicts in succession, disregarding the fact that the old General Qin Lie was severely injured, insisting that he charge into battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The old General Qin Lie, with three battle flags inserted into the back of his chariot, struggled to his feet, lifted his long spear, and step by heavy step, headed towards the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He sang:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Since childhood, I was nurtured by the former lord, his grace as vast as a mountain engraved in my heart. He taught me loyalty and righteousness to protect the land, imparted wisdom and courage to establish the world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"The former lord's grace, like a father and brother, allowed me to grow, teaching loyalty and righteousness, bestowing wisdom and courage..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The gong sounded steady and powerful, as if announcing the weight and tragedy of this battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He sang again:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"The young lord is young, I support him with all my heart, like a father and brother, I give my all. Though slandered, my heart holds no resentment, only wishing for the nation to stand firm forever."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"The young lord is small, I support you to ascend the throne, like nurturing a sapling, hoping you become a forest. Though slandered, my heart holds no resentment, only wishing for the nation to revive..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The jinghu emitted a high-pitched, clear sound, sometimes mournful, tugging at the heartstrings; sometimes melodious, expressing Qin Lie's certain expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Old General Qin Lie charged into the battlefield like a lion, killing enemies left and right, causing heads to roll and the enemy to tremble in fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He sang:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Though old in body, my spirit remains undiminished, shedding blood on the battlefield to repay the nation's grace. The former lord's spirit smiles in the heavens, I have no regrets going to battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The drum sounded, thick and powerful, like galloping warhorses, grand and majestic. Yuan Dasheng watched, his blood boiling!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Qin Lie fought tirelessly, his injuries worsening and his stamina depleted. Ultimately, he fell on the battlefield, unable to break through the thick enemy lines despite his efforts to charge and rescue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Knowing his fate was sealed, Qin Lie raised his head and sang:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"The former lord's grace is forever remembered, my heart is tied to the young lord's revival. Shedding blood on the battlefield is not in vain, my soul returns to comfort the former lord. What fear do I have of the enemy, a thousand troops and horses are not to be feared!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"My death is not for fame or fortune, but for pure loyalty. Remembering the former lord's heavy grace, how can I retreat in the face of national peril?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Young lord, I hope you understand, a loyal minister has no regrets in sacrificing his life. After my death, I wish you to know, my loyal heart and red courage protect the kingdom." The rhythm of the drums changed multiple times, reflecting both the intense tension of battle and the tragic grandeur of farewell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">In the end, Qin Lie and the enemy general nearly perished together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">In his final moments, he faced the direction of the capital, half-kneeling on the ground, clasping his hands in salute: "My lord, your humble servant is leaving!" A heavy drumbeat echoed across the entire stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Suddenly, the suona sounded, its high and resonant notes filled with tragic grandeur, piercing through time and space, striking Yuan Dasheng's heart directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The suona continued for a moment, then the sound of a flute joined in. The flute's notes were crisp and pleasant, sometimes winding and low, sometimes high and spirited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Finally, the sound soared, like a bluebird flying into the sky, its distant figure gradually disappearing into the vast blue heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Yuan Dasheng looked up, speechless for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It was his first time watching this puppet show, and he could already understand human speech, deeply moved in both body and mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Da Ti, Da Sheng!" Yuan Yi ran back, holding several patches of ointment in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He smiled and said, "Good luck, the pharmacy was clearing out, and I got a good deal, managed to get a few extra patches of ointment. Come, let me apply them for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Yuan Dasheng let Yuan Yi treat his wounds, looking at Yuan Yi and then at the puppets on the high stage. The lantern light, like fire, reflected on his face, while the sounds of celebration and applause from the crowd on the other side of the wall constantly echoed in his ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Let's go, why are you still sitting there?" Yuan Yi stood up and took a step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Yuan Dasheng reached out, pointing to the high stage opposite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Yuan Yi turned to look, indifferent: "Oh, it's a puppet show." Yuan Yi glanced again: "It's the Qin Lie Battle Song, a very famous piece. It's a pity he followed the wrong person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Yuan Yi walked ahead, and Yuan Dasheng followed behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">As they walked out of the alley, he turned back for one last look at the mechanical stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The stage was slowly descending, the puppet playing the old general Qin Lie still half-kneeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yuan Dasheng looked at Yuan Yi's back and suddenly made a few "ah ah" sounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">I turned my head in confusion, glanced at Yuan Dasheng, not understanding what it wanted to say, and simply waved my hand: "Let's go quickly, go home and fill our stomachs, and sleep early!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Depending on each other for survival, fighting beasts, Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Look, Dasheng, this is my child, he is my child!" Yuan Yi exclaimed with joy, "I have a child now, I have descendants in this world." "I named him Yuan Er. Dasheng, my life is not as long as yours." "If one day I'm no longer here, let Yuan Er take my place and continue to accompany you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Yuan Er was hungry and started crying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Yuan Dasheng squeezed the juice out of a peach the size of a washbasin and poured it over him. As a result, Yuan Er was drenched like a drowned rat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Yuan Er fell ill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Yuan Dasheng moved like the wind through the Immortal City at night, rushed into the medical hall, grabbed the pharmacist by the neck, and dragged him along, flying and leaping, the pharmacist's screams breaking the tranquility of the moonlit night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yuan Er began to climb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He clung to Yuan Dasheng's thick monkey fur, challenging the heights, and every time he fell, he was caught precisely by Yuan Dasheng's palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yuan Er could walk and jump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Uncle Monkey, they bullied me!" Yuan Er brought Yuan Dasheng to seek justice, scaring the other children into wetting themselves and crying in despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Yuan Er began to be brave and aggressive, curious about one thing: "Uncle Monkey, who is stronger, you or my dad? Have you ever fought? I asked my dad, but he never answers me." Yuan Er ran to Yuan Dasheng, his face full of admiration and excitement: "Uncle Monkey, you are so powerful, so fierce, when can I be like you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Dad, I heard you want to find a demonic cultivation technique for Uncle Monkey? Don't do that!" Yuan Er burst into the study, shouting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Yuan Yi's face turned iron-like, and he angrily shouted: "Shut up, who has been filling your ears with nonsense again?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Dad, Uncle Monkey's strength is already unmatched. Those monkeys and their descendants, calling them pets is inaccurate; they are the true masters. Those cultivators are merely slaves responsible for feeding them." "The situation is already like this, if Uncle Monkey's strength leaps further, it will be even worse." "By then, who will the Monkey Head Gang belong to?" Yuan Er pleaded bitterly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Separated by a few houses, Yuan Dasheng, who possessed demonic skills, heard every word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Its brows drooped, no longer lying down, but crouching on the ground, looking down, and letting out whimpering sounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The monkeys and their descendants were killed, Yuan Dasheng extended a finger and lightly tapped Yuan Er's chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Yuan Er survived the assassination attempt, Yuan Dasheng injured his own soul to protect him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">During the explosion at the Fire Persimmon Festival, Yuan Dasheng shielded Yuan Er in his embrace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">On his deathbed, Yuan Dasheng extended his finger one last time. In a daze, he seemed to hear the melody of "Qin Lie Goes to Battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Yuan Er was dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After a brief period of chaos, the Monkey Head Gang was quickly stabilized by an elder who ascended to power and restored order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Yuan Dasheng was also dead!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">This was Ning Zhuo's strongest feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He retrieved the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng and repaired the entire mechanism, but he couldn't find any trace of its spirit, as if it had never existed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Sun Laoda's secret mark in the well remains unchanged."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo clenched his fists. Every time he wanted to personally investigate Sun Lingtong's situation, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his Divine Sea would flare up, emitting dazzling Buddhist light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">My Buddha saves himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The precious seal warned!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">It cautioned Ning Zhuo that if he took action, he would fall into someone else's trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Cheng Bai's face turned ashen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He looked at Sun Lingtong, finding it hard to believe that someone could withstand his Soul Punishment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Sun Lingtong's hands and legs were nailed with coffin nails, his entire body pinned to a pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">His brows were tightly furrowed, his eyes rolled back, and due to some spell's torment, his body would occasionally twitch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Despite the torture, Cheng Bai gained nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">To maintain his role as the investigating judge, he had to expend more and more soul power and magic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">On any other day, he might have stopped torturing Sun Lingtong. After all, torturing Sun Lingtong to extract information about Chuitiao Guest was merely to lure out Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">It was a losing deal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">But in the Tiger Battle Fate Arena, Cheng Bai's desire to win was especially fierce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Perhaps his collapse is just a moment away!" Cheng Bai roared with a sinister expression, "Very well, I like your kind of stubbornness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Next, you will endure ten times the pain from before!" "Hehehe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Death would be a blessing for you. Unfortunately, you angered me." Cheng Bai activated a spell, striking Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong felt as if mountains were crushing him, the pain so intense that he hallucinated his body and soul being ground to dust by the mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Boundless pain seeped into every inch of his skin, yet he couldn't lose consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He was like a small boat, tossed in a storm, falling into an endless ocean whirlpool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Past memories shone like a beam of light, weak yet stubborn, persisting in this boundless darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">All of this was about Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Others can learn to control the black market, why can't we?" "Interesting, let's unite as brothers and take control of the black market!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Little Zhuo, don't reveal your true face. Use the Blue Iron Armor to disguise yourself. As for me, I'm already well-known, it doesn't matter." Ning Zhuo smiled and changed his address, "From now on, I'll just call you Boss Sun!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Boss, the goods are not right." "Boss Sun, I'm right behind you." "Boss, charge!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Boss Sun, don't worry, I'll always follow you." The intense pain engulfed Sun Lingtong like a vast ocean.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He opened his eyes, and the once lively eyes were now filled with blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sun Lingtong let out a tragic smile, knowing that the effect of the Void Seal was limited, and he could hardly hold on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He resolutely activated his last resort!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Cheng Bai keenly noticed the anomaly and was shocked, "What? You're actually destroying your own soul!" Sun Lingtong triggered the Void Seal, attacking his own soul to resist Cheng Bai's soul search.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Cheng Bai's eyes widened in disbelief, "Who exactly is that Chui Xu Ke to you? You're willing to let your soul scatter to protect him?!" "Are you really from the Void Sect? Are you still a waste cultivator?!" "Could it be that he is your fellow disciple? The Holy Son of your Void Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Hehe." Sun Lingtong grinned, struggling to let out his last laugh, "He's not my fellow disciple, he's my brother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Brother?" Cheng Bai was even more puzzled, "Aren't brothers meant to be betrayed? For a bit of information, you're willing to give up your life? What exactly do you want?" Sun Lingtong lowered his eyelids, too weak, his voice very faint, "I... I just want to prove... he didn't... follow the wrong person." Cheng Bai tilted his ear to listen, and this was what he heard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Incomprehensible!" Cheng Bai was furious to the extreme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">In his entire life, he had never been so angry!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He felt deeply violated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He completely lost his patience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">At this moment, he forgot about subduing Han Wu, forgot about Chui Xu Ke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He pointed his fingers like a sword and fiercely stabbed towards Sun Lingtong's forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">This stab would surely pierce through Sun Lingtong's forehead, causing true death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Boom!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">An explosion suddenly occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Cheng Bai sneered coldly, completely disregarding everything, determined to kill Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">But in the next moment, the formation patterns appeared, firmly protecting Sun Lingtong and blocking the fatal blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">A violent explosion surged forth, accompanied by a torrent of scorching flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The explosion swept Cheng Bai away, subsequently engulfing him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">In contrast, Sun Lingtong, under the protection of the formation patterns, was transported out of the house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">In the next moment, he landed beside an old man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">This old man was decrepit, his face weathered, with dark purple bags under his eyes and deep wrinkles that could trap insects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">His hair was a disheveled black mess, spreading from the top of his head to his shoulders, hanging down to his feet like a large black cloak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He held a cane, his waist and back hunched severely, his entire posture bent like a lobster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">He called himself Chui Xu Ke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">He was Sun Lingtong's... brother!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
