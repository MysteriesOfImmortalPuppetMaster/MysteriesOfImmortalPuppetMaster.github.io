<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“Father, I heard you're looking for a monster cultivation technique for Uncle Monkey? Don't do it!” Yuan Er burst into the study, shouting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Yuan Yi’s face turned ashen. “Silence! Who’s been filling your ears with nonsense again?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Father, Uncle Monkey’s strength is already beyond our control. We say those monkey descendants of his are our pets, but they’re more like our masters. We cultivators are nothing more than slaves tasked with feeding them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Our current situation is already like this. If you let Uncle Monkey grow even stronger, things will only get worse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“By then, who will the Monkey Head Gang truly belong to?” Yuan Er pleaded relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Yuan Yi’s lips quivered as he fell into a deathly silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Monkey Head Gang was a legacy he had put a lifetime of hard work into building.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Seizing power was easy, but maintaining it was difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He was old now. Even in his prime, he had only barely managed to keep the gang’s power in balance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Yuan Dasheng was a Molten Flame Demonic Ape, with truly overwhelming strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">During times of conflict, this was an absolute advantage. But now that the Monkey Head Gang had secured its footing and no other faction posed a threat, this advantage had instead become an internal danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Yuan Er was Yuan Yi’s only bloodline descendant. The Monkey Head Gang was meant to be passed down to him. But could he really take the reins?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Yuan Yi trusted himself, and had no doubts about his own relationship with Yuan Dasheng. But when it came to the relationship between Yuan Er and Yuan Dasheng, his confidence was sorely lacking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Yuan Yi thought about it for a whole day and night. In the end, he called for Yuan Er, face pale, and gave him a single instruction: “Remember this! Treat your Uncle Monkey with kindness. Show him even more respect than you show me! Understand?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“I understand!” Yuan Er promised immediately with a joyful heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Due to guilt, Yuan Er did indeed treat Yuan Dasheng with more respect than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">All the other members of the gang showed more respect toward Yuan Dasheng as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">But when Yuan Er became the gang leader, he found himself in an awkward position. He needed to rely on Yuan Dasheng to maintain the gang’s loyalty, but precisely because of that reliance, he never truly won their loyalty for himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Yuan Er knelt by the bedside, looking at Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Uncle Monkey, your kindness to me is as great as a mountain. I won’t deny it, and I remember everything clearly in my heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“But the messenger is right. Letting you lie sick in this bed is the greatest humiliation for you!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“I… I don’t want to do this. It’s because I respect you! Because I admire you!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“I think, if my father’s spirit in the afterlife knew about this, he would definitely agree with what I’m about to do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“I know he would understand… The enemy is too strong. Our Monkey Head Gang can't win.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Since that’s the case, I’ll just join them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“My father always said, a real man knows when to yield and when to fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Everything I’m doing, all the humiliation I’m enduring and burden I’m bearing, is to preserve his legacy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Uncle Monkey, you must understand my intentions!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“You and my father built up the Monkey Head Gang through a lifetime of conflict. I can’t let it fall apart in my hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“I need to pass it down to my sons and grandsons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“One day, after growing and increasing our power, we’ll start up a cultivation clan! The Yuan Clan will become the fifth major force in Fire Persimmon City!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Uncle Monkey, please understand me, don’t blame me! You understand me, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Yuan Er repeated his thoughts over and over in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Suddenly, Yuan Dasheng slowly opened its eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Yuan Er trembled as if struck by lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But Yuan Dasheng’s eyes were dull and gray, clouded with no light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">It couldn’t see anything, nor could it hear. However, it still had its sense of smell, and caught the familiar scent on Yuan Er’s body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Yuan Dasheng tried to rise, but its body felt as heavy as a mountain. It wanted to lift its hand, but could barely feel anything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In the end, it could only slowly extend a finger and point at Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Yuan Er was startled and fell backward in fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the next moment, Yuan Dasheng’s index finger gently dropped, and the breath of life disappeared from its body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">It was gone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Yuan Er froze for a moment, then suddenly burst into loud sobs, tears streaming down his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He crawled on his knees to Yuan Dasheng’s body and screamed hoarsely, “Uncle Monkey, Uncle Monkey!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He cried out the words his father hadn’t finished saying before his death: “Uncle Monkey, I’m sorry. Uncle Monkey, I’ve failed you…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">At some unknown point in time, Ning Zhuo had left the study and arrived in the bedroom. Standing behind Yuan Er, he watched with his own eyes as Yuan Dasheng’s final moments passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">At last, Yuan Dasheng was finally dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But the joy of victory in Ning Zhuo’s heart wasn’t nearly as intense as he had imagined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo was full of complicated feelings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yuan Dasheng’s miserable end had been entirely because of Ning Zhuo’s machinations. But even until its demise, it knew nothing of Ning Zhuo’s existence, nor even that it had offended such a deadly enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">As for Ning Zhuo himself?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo had never planned on becoming Yuan Dasheng’s enemy. Before Yuan Dasheng broke into the immortal palace, they hadn’t even met.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But despite that!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Destiny had chosen the Lava Immortal Palace as the stage and placed Ning Zhuo and Yuan Dasheng on a deadly path with no return. It was either you die or I die.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">There was no other option.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“If I had a choice, Yuan Dasheng, I would rather have been your comrade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“What a shame…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">With regret in his heart, Ning Zhuo stepped forward and began dealing with Yuan Dasheng’s corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A startled Yuan Er instinctively reached out to stop him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">But Ning Zhuo kicked him aside, finally revealing the contempt and anger he had been suppressing all along. He growled in a low voice, “Out of my way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Even if Yuan Er had Foundation Establishment cultivation, what was the point when his temperament was so lacking?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">When Ning Zhuo first saw Yuan Dasheng in the bedroom, he immediately noticed that it hadn’t taken the Late Autumn Life Preservation Pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zhu Xuanji had clearly already given Yuan Er the pill, but Yuan Er didn’t pass it on to Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Was it because he didn’t have time?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He had plenty of time!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This alone had revealed to Ning Zhuo Yuan Er’s true intentions, and was also why he suggested for Yuan Er to ask Yuan Dasheng for its opinion. As expected, Yuan Er just knelt down, calling out in his heart but not once speaking aloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Gang Leader Yuan Er, please restrain your grief.” Ning Zhuo stuffed the ape’s corpse into his storage bag and turned to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Kneeling on the ground, Yuan Er grabbed Ning Zhuo’s leg and looked up at him. “When will I be able to see my Uncle Monkey again?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Once the production schedule is confirmed, I'll notify you. Don't worry, it won’t be long." After giving some reassurance, Ning Zhuo shook his leg forcefully and walked away without looking back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Behind him, Yuan Er fell into a daze, alone in the empty bedroom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo remained calm. As he was about to exit the Monkey Head Gang’s headquarters, he overheard the returning gang members discussing among themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“All of Fire Persimmon Forest has been picked clean, but that black shadow demonic cultivator never showed up!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“Didn’t they say that he was sealed by a formation and forced to hide deep in the forest?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“He really wasn’t there? How could that be?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Yeah, I was hoping for a hunt.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“You should’ve seen how ugly Sir Fei Si’s face was!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“Right now, Golden Core cultivators from all the great forces are searching everywhere in Fire Persimmon Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Hearing these discussions, Ning Zhuo’s heart immediately tightened. “This is bad!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">With his quick wits, he instantly realized that he had once again fallen into a dangerous situation. The moment he left the Monkey Head Gang, he increased his speed, rushing directly to the Flying Disk Workshop without wasting a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
