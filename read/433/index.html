<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo returned to the Immortal City of Green Forest.<br/>
<br/>
But he did not rush to the All-Book Pavilion; instead, he first went to the big market, the small market, and even strolled through the black market.<br/>
<br/>
Among them, he selectively sold some of the treasures he had on hand.<br/>
<br/>
For example, he sold two hundred Mist Orchids. Seeing that the selling price wasn't increasing, he decisively stopped early.<br/>
<br/>
He sold all 180 pieces of Haze Stones.<br/>
<br/>
Originally, Ning Zhuo planned to pair this material with the Weather Balloon: Ice Crystal Snow. Now it seemed that even if the Weather Balloon: Ice Crystal Snow could enhance some combat power, it would be difficult to have good effects in the current great war against Golden Core, Nascent Soul, or even Divine Transformation stage cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, at this moment, Ning Zhuo was extremely short of time and energy; how could he have time to invest in such small improvements?<br/>
<br/>
He happened to encounter a cultivator who urgently needed Haze Stones to make spiritual food, so he sold them all, fetching a relatively high price.<br/>
<br/>
Sixty drops of Purple Qi Morning Dew were quickly sold out.<br/>
<br/>
After all, there were still many cultivators who used Purple Qi to cultivate.<br/>
<br/>
In Green Forest Immortal City and the military camps outside, many cultivators were gathered, and their daily cultivation consumed an enormous amount of resources.<br/>
<br/>
Purple Qi Morning Dew was not easy to collect, but it wasn't very precious, so it was easy to sell out, but the price wouldn't be high.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also sold more than half of the Heavy Thunder Beetles, mainly to cultivators from the Fire Cloud Battalion. The Fire Cloud Battalion excelled in fire techniques, but since ancient times, fire and thunder were closely related, so it wasn't strange for them to use Heavy Thunder Beetles.<br/>
<br/>
This batch was sold at a relatively high price.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators of the Fire Cloud Battalion were very straightforward; they didn't even haggle and directly agreed to Ning Zhuo's price. This showed that the military funds of the Fire Cloud Battalion were relatively abundant.<br/>
<br/>
Inspired by this, Ning Zhuo immediately changed his selling strategy.<br/>
<br/>
He proactively promoted to several other military camps. No one purchased the Heavy Thunder Beetles, but all the camps showed great interest in Heavenly Dew.<br/>
<br/>
Because the Heavenly Dew in Ning Zhuo's hands could be used to make healing pills. With the great war imminent, it was always good to have more of such healing medicines.<br/>
<br/>
The final result was that the Heavenly Dew in Ning Zhuo's hands was directly sold out, sold in batches to several military camps, among which the White Jade Army was the largest customer.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo calculated that selling off the treasures didn't yield enough spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
So he continued to hide his identity and quietly sold one or two pieces of the Old Stone Monster's treasures in the black market.<br/>
<br/>
Materials at the Nascent Soul level could be considered high-grade goods, and the treasures in Ning Zhuo's hands were absolutely outstanding in quality; the moment he took them out, they firmly attracted others' attention.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, these two pieces of stone treasures were sold at high prices.<br/>
<br/>
After making such preparations, Ning Zhuo, carrying a large amount of spiritual food, then headed to the All-Book Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
The All-Book Pavilion was a super sect with branches in many cultivation nations.<br/>
<br/>
Because it strictly adhered to neutrality, the righteous path, the demonic path, and the evil path all had continuous and strong demand for techniques, leading to a vast audience for the All-Book Pavilion, and it had space to survive in both Righteous and Demonic regions, as well as in gray zones.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the scale of the All-Book Pavilion was extremely large, far surpassing super sects like the Soul Devouring Sect and the Void Sect.<br/>
<br/>
There was an All-Book Pavilion in the Immortal City of Green Forest.<br/>
<br/>
In broad daylight, Ning Zhuo wore black clothes, covered his face, put on a hood, cast spells, and used magical tools to disguise himself.<br/>
<br/>
He slowly stepped into the All-Book Pavilion, his voice hoarse: "Shopkeeper, give me a demonic cultivation technique that involves blood sacrifice."<br/>
<br/>
On the first floor, some cultivators were selecting techniques. Hearing this, they immediately turned around and looked over.<br/>
<br/>
"A demonic cultivator!"<br/>
<br/>
"Really unlucky."<br/>
<br/>
"Alas, since the Immortal City of Green Forest became the rear of the two major armies of Twin Rivers Kingdom, establishing and training new troops, these evil and demonic cultivators have emerged in an endless stream, and public security has become too poor."<br/>
<br/>
"Since when could demonic cultivators openly enter the Immortal City and buy demonic cultivation techniques on a grand scale?"<br/>
<br/>
Many cultivators secretly shook their heads.<br/>
<br/>
Demonic cultivators generally had to conceal their identities and hide themselves when operating in the Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Because many of them were on wanted lists, with vivid portraits posted at the city gates or on bulletin boards.<br/>
<br/>
The Immortal City of Green Forest was in a special period due to the Thousand Peaks Forest War.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did this out of helplessness.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't use his real appearance to purchase demonic cultivation techniques; it would be of no benefit to himself or the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
The shop assistant of the All-Book Pavilion, full of vigilance, came to Ning Zhuo, nodding and bowing, with a smile on his face: "This master, please come inside."<br/>
<br/>
The All-Book Pavilion was known for having all books, so naturally, it also sold demonic cultivation techniques.<br/>
<br/>
The shop assistant led Ning Zhuo into a secret room, where a manager came to receive him and inquired about his specific requirements for demonic techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then stated that he needed a technique involving blood sacrifice of the flesh.<br/>
<br/>
The manager waited for a few breaths, not hearing further details, couldn't help but feel puzzled, and asked, "Sir, there are many demonic techniques involving blood sacrifice of the flesh, but they have different effects. For example, greatly enhancing escape techniques, or dramatically increasing combat power. What kind of power would you require?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn't care about this: "I just need one that can sacrifice the flesh, regardless of its function. Tell me, what are there?"<br/>
<br/>
The manager's heart skipped a beat, his vigilance growing stronger.<br/>
<br/>
This man in black before him only wanted blood sacrifice, regardless of its function, always feeling like he was up to something, perhaps aiming to massacre living beings or destroy corpses and erase traces.<br/>
<br/>
But business was still business.<br/>
<br/>
The manager took a deep breath, mobilized his divine sense, first reviewed the jade slip catalog, and after checking, he had an answer in his heart, and then responded to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
There were many demonic techniques that could blood sacrifice the flesh.<br/>
<br/>
The most classic was the Blood Demon Disintegration Method. In the All-Book Pavilion, it was divided into the Minor and Major Blood Demon Disintegration Methods, with obvious differences in power.<br/>
<br/>
The minor method, although less powerful, only disintegrated part of the body, with fewer side effects.<br/>
<br/>
The Major Blood Demon Disintegration Method was the most classic. In the earliest times, once this spell was activated, regardless of the enemy, one would inevitably perish, with a miserable end.<br/>
<br/>
But after being improved and optimized by sages over generations, and even bringing forth new ideas, the side effects of the current Major Blood Demon Disintegration Method had been greatly reduced, and it no longer required paying with one's life.<br/>
<br/>
"Bone Soul Desolate Sacrifice Technique..." the manager continued to introduce.<br/>
<br/>
This spell's history could be traced back to the period before the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. At that time, there were no gods, demons, monsters, or ghosts between heaven and earth. The ancients worshipped heaven and earth, temporarily separating their own bones and souls from their bodies, transforming into skeletal wraiths, roaming between heaven and earth.<br/>
<br/>
If successful, the ancients would return with their bones and souls, greatly increasing their strength. If they failed, their bones and souls would dissolve into heaven and earth, offered as sacrifices to heaven and earth.<br/>
<br/>
"Flesh-Cutting Shadow Sacrifice Technique..."<br/>
<br/>
This cultivation method was very new, born after the Night Rain Dynasty, when the principles of 'ghosts and spirits' were added to the world.<br/>
<br/>
As can be seen from the name of the spell, this spell was about sacrificing the cultivator's shadow. By cutting away one's own flesh and blood, the power of the cultivator's shadow was continuously increased, ultimately cultivating it into a powerful shadow monster.<br/>
<br/>
"Scarlet Blood Offering to Heaven Art..."<br/>
<br/>
This cultivation method was extremely powerful, but the prerequisite for casting it was that the cultivator had to have blood-related talent. The cost was also very high. Usually, after casting, one's own talent would significantly decline. If used excessively, it could even completely consume one's talent.<br/>
<br/>
Besides these, there were also the Death Moon Offering Song, Soul Returning to Heaven and Earth, Heavenly Burial Ceremony, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo listened to the manager's introduction, and sighed in his heart: "As expected of the All-Book Pavilion, so many demonic techniques, truly dazzling."<br/>
<br/>
The cultivation world had developed to this day, not only had spiritual energy become more abundant, with talents emerging endlessly, but also various divine skills and wonderful methods were being widely disseminated, optimized and improved every year, and even bringing forth new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
This was truly a golden age of cultivation, like boiling oil over a raging fire, as prosperous as flourishing scenery.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and chose the Minor Blood Demon Disintegration Method, the Death Moon Offering Song, and the Heavenly Burial Ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing him choose so many at once, the manager's smile became more sincere. After completing this business, he could also get a considerable commission.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, the manager's apprehension grew.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's purchase like this clearly indicated that he had big plans and unfathomable intentions.<br/>
<br/>
"Sir may already have an understanding of our All-Book Pavilion. Currently, we have two payment methods."<br/>
<br/>
"One is to choose to pay with spirit stones."<br/>
<br/>
"The other is to exchange for Pavilion Gold and use Pavilion Gold to purchase."<br/>
<br/>
Pavilion Gold was the All-Book Pavilion's own currency, without physical form, just a numerical record.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had a sum of Pavilion Gold in his hand, but not much. It was obtained when he sold some cultivation techniques in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivation techniques he chose to purchase were absolutely top-quality among them.<br/>
<br/>
After this incident, Ning Zhuo had a new perspective on the All-Book Pavilion: "Selling cultivation techniques is really a good business!"<br/>
<br/>
"As long as such cultivation techniques are sold more times, the cost of acquiring this technique is averaged down, becoming less and less. Reaching a certain limit, it can even approach zero cost."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt very envious.<br/>
<br/>
He had obtained a large amount of the Old Stone Monster's treasures, which could be said to have completely lifted him out of poverty, making him rich overnight.<br/>
<br/>
But returning to the Immortal City, he found that although he had gained a lot, the consumption was also great!<br/>
<br/>
This time, purchasing three demonic blood sacrifice spells was also out of necessity. Ning Zhuo had to do his best to deal with the upcoming ambush battle.<br/>
<br/>
"I had planned to buy a suitable cultivation technique for Meng Yehu."<br/>
<br/>
"Alas, I'm short of money."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's biggest wealth was the stone treasures, but he was currently too busy to calculate their total value.<br/>
<br/>
But these treasures, not to mention the hidden dangers of the Stone Forging Earth Treasure Divine Ability attached to them, because of their high quality, Ning Zhuo was not very eager to sell them.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Ning Zhuo's spirit stone reserves and fire essence reserves were almost exhausted, very dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
He also had no time to deal with this matter for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
After obtaining the three demonic techniques, he hopped into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and immediately left the city.<br/>
<br/>
Coming to a remote and uninhabited mountain, he immersed himself in studying these techniques.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of body cultivation and demonic techniques, he had a shallow understanding and couldn't fully comprehend their principles.<br/>
<br/>
But because he bought three, he could refer to them mutually. Just like when he had learned how to cultivate the Spirit Concealment Willow in the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect before. Just speaking of the application level, he could barely master the methods he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo began to improve the Five Viscera Temple Spirit God Technique around the method of blood sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
Improving a cultivation method had always been very difficult.<br/>
<br/>
But this most difficult step, Ning Zhuo felt, was even easier and more natural than when he had just studied the demonic techniques.<br/>
<br/>
After spending a day and a half, Ning Zhuo completed the improvement.<br/>
<br/>
The original Five Viscera Temple Spirit God Technique was a cultivation method that specialized in cultivating the middle Dantian Qi Sea, transforming the flesh, causing rapid increase in spiritual energy, and having strong control over the five-element spiritual qi.<br/>
<br/>
But now, Ning Zhuo had deleted most of it, focusing only on the part of transforming the flesh, and combined it with the demonic blood sacrifice methods, forming a Five-Viscera Temple Spiritual Divine Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered over the result for a moment, felt satisfied, and immediately took action.<br/>
<br/>
He went to the cabin and awakened Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong broke open the stone coat and, upon hearing Ning Zhuo's plan, couldn't help but be astonished: "What? Little Zhu, you want to burn the Old Stone Monster?"<br/>
<br/>
After cultivating so many times, Sun Lingtong couldn't help but have some attachment to the Old Stone Monster's body.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "Boss, I have great confidence."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded, put away the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat, and began to watch.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo first activated the Stone Forging Earth Treasure Divine Ability, unlocking all the defenses of the stone ball.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he directly activated the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra, starting to burn the stone ball.<br/>
<br/>
The stone ball itself was an aggregation of Nascent Soul-level treasures, quite resistant to burning. After burning for half a day, spiritual essence began to emerge.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo burned while absorbing these spiritual essences.<br/>
<br/>
Only when the spiritual essence was fully abundant did he extinguish the flames.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he took out a slender awl and carefully chiseled a small hole, penetrating all the way to the core of the stone.<br/>
<br/>
Through the small hole, Ning Zhuo saw the ten-thousand-year earth essence hidden in the deepest part of the stone core.<br/>
<br/>
This earth essence was the true body of the Old Stone Monster.<br/>
<br/>
"Let me do it, let me do it!" Sun Lingtong couldn't bear it on the side and volunteered.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong giggled, took a leap, and jumped in front of the stone ball.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then retreated slightly.<br/>
<br/>
"Heh!"<br/>
<br/>
He let out a tender grunt, then opened his short arms and tried to hug the stone ball.<br/>
<br/>
He directly lifted the stone ball and shook it left and right.<br/>
<br/>
The ten-thousand-year earth essence in the stone core flowed out like fine sand along the hole.<br/>
<br/>
The stone ball was quite heavy; before, Sun Lingtong couldn't move it an inch. But now, his physical constitution had greatly increased, his strength had grown a lot, and he could actually lift it and keep shaking it.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong clenched his teeth, his small face flushed red, and with a bang, he put the stone ball back down.<br/>
<br/>
"Still a bit heavy, almost exhausted," Sun Lingtong thought to himself, quite nervous. Not that he was afraid of the stone ball crushing himself, but worried about making a fool of himself and being laughed at by his own brother.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong tugged at his collar, pretended to exhale lightly, then turned to look at Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
His face was flushed, but he tried to keep his expression calm, raising his eyebrows at Ning Zhuo: "How about it, Little Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo ignored his flushed face and directly gave a thumbs-up: "Boss, as expected of you."<br/>
<br/>
"Hehehe!" Sun Lingtong immediately put his hands on his hips, raised his small face, and was immensely proud.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, using the Embryonic Breath Spiritual Boat to nourish the flesh is really great."<br/>
<br/>
"I strongly recommend you imitate me. We don't need to rush to dismantle the Old Stone Monster's remaining corpse. Combining it with the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat is an excellent cultivation method."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly, expressing that they were still short of funds, but he also agreed with Sun Lingtong's words.<br/>
<br/>
The problem of funds could be solved through other means; such cultivation shortcuts were hard to come by.<br/>
<br/>
Whether it was the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat or the Old Stone Monster's body, they were rare opportunities. The two were indispensable, and only by combining them could they have such a wonderful effect.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered: "I don't have your comprehension of 'Void,' Boss. Actually using it, the effect would be much less than yours."<br/>
<br/>
"Let's not worry about these for now. Boss, please cooperate with me next."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was almost always responsive to Ning Zhuo's requests and immediately nodded: "No problem!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sat down cross-legged and adjusted his state.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment, he slowly opened his eyes, his face resolute.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss, light the fire."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong responded, activated the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolving Sutra, and ignited a flame.<br/>
<br/>
The firelight reflected on Ning Zhuo's face; he was expressionless.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he took out a dagger and stabbed himself fiercely.<br/>
<br/>
Blood did not spurt out but condensed into strands of blood muscles, woven into a net, locking around the wound.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth secretly, dragged the dagger, and cut open his abdomen!<br/>
<br/>
Severe pain struck; his brows tightened, and his face grew colder.<br/>
<br/>
Without needing to lower his head, Ning Zhuo used his divine sense, which had long locked onto his own spleen.<br/>
<br/>
He used the dagger to cut off his spleen, held it in his left hand, and gently tossed it into the air.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, he activated the Five-Viscera Temple Spiritual Divine Technique he had just designed and improved.<br/>
<br/>
Qi was continuously consumed, stimulating a blood-colored light that enveloped the spleen.<br/>
<br/>
Under the illumination, the spleen emitted a faint yellow light. Among the five viscera and six bowels, it belonged to the earth element.<br/>
<br/>
After the blood light shone for a moment and the timing was ripe, Ning Zhuo moved his mind, causing the spleen to fall directly into the fire below.<br/>
<br/>
As the flame burned, Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to throw the spiritual essence of the Old Stone Monster into the fire.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he continuously maintained the blood light, shining on the spleen in the fire, not stopping for a moment!<br/>
<br/>
The spleen gradually melted in the cremation, absorbed the spiritual essence of the Old Stone Monster, and finally transformed into a ball of light.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the light ball was a yellowish-brown color, vaguely with a temple, and the outer layer of the light ball was a layer of blood-colored brilliance.<br/>
<br/>
The Five Viscera Temple Spirit God Technique was precisely about transforming the five viscera into five temples, used to create gods and store gods.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo improved this cultivation method, took most of it, forming a spell, still refining his own organs into temples.<br/>
<br/>
But he combined it with external objects. This was the concept he had gained from cultivating the Three Sect Superior Techniques.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Sect Superior Techniques were good at leveraging external objects.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique required setting up various treasure mirrors, combined with divine sense, to exert wonderful power.<br/>
<br/>
"I have already cultivated the Three Sect Superior Techniques and cannot also cultivate the Five Viscera Temple Spirit God Technique."<br/>
<br/>
"I cannot change my cultivation but still want to create gods, so I can only create external gods."<br/>
<br/>
"This cultivation method takes the cultivator's spiritual essence to create internal gods."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo first refined his own spleen, using the pure earth essence restored after the Old Stone Monster's death to serve as his external god.<br/>
<br/>
This undoubtedly matched extremely well with the earth element in the five elements.<br/>
<br/>
After refining, Ning Zhuo gently inhaled, sucking the spleen temple into his abdomen, returning it to its original position.<br/>
<br/>
The wound quickly closed, and the spleen temple could still perform its original function, participating in and maintaining Ning Zhuo's life activities.<br/>
<br/>
A moment later, Ning Zhuo smoothed his abdomen, letting the wound completely disappear.<br/>
<br/>
"Boss, I did it!" The young man had an expression of excitement.</div>
