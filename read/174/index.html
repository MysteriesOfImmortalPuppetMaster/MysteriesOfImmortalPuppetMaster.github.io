<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 174: Zhou Zeshen's Deep Challenge</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Xiangqian's Life Hanging by a Thread was normal, but Ning Xiangguo's Life Hanging by a Thread was the smallest and most transparent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Based on Ning Zhuo's understanding of this divine ability, he speculated that Ning Xiangguo either harbored many secrets or had ulterior motives and did not truly rely on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Considering the City Lord's Mansion's infiltration into the three major families and their significant intelligence advantage, Ning Zhuo preliminarily judged: Ning Xiangguo was very likely an informant developed by the City Lord's Mansion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Divine Abilityâ€”Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">During its use, Ning Zhuo increasingly felt its marvelous utility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">When Ning Zhuo activated it, he could forcibly control others' actions using the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The specifics of the actions, their magnitude, and so on, depended on the relative strength of both parties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo's attempts showed that he could extract Yuan Dasheng's spirituality and Sun Lingtong's soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">However, this was based on the latter two's voluntary and full cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">For others, under resistance or ignorance, Ning Zhuo could not achieve this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">At least for now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"After setting up the Life Hanging by a Thread, it has remained without needing replenishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Even without activation, I can infer the size of the target's hidden secrets and true intentions through the thread's state." This meant that Ning Zhuo could, to some extent, detect the "loyalty" of those under his control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This was already quite impressive!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Not to mention, there were other wondrous uses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Moreover, after planting the Life Hanging by a Thread, the fate energy can gather together and fully combine." "No matter how you look at it, this divine ability is an unparalleled tool for managing power!" "I wonder what the final qualitative change of this divine ability will be when the lotus blooms." Ning Zhuo became increasingly curious about the answer to this question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">As for Ning Xiangguo, Ning Zhuo pretended not to know and still entrusted him with important tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">It had to be said that among all the Foundation Establishment cultivators, Ning Xiangguo had the best vision and handled matters meticulously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Assigning tasks to him was reassuring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In comparison, although Ning Xiangqian had the best combat power and was once a steward of the family War Hall, he was not as reliable as Ning Xiangguo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">After handling the black market affairs, Ning Zhuo returned to his room for intense cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He minimized his external activities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The once-every-three-days spell exchanges were changed to once every five days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The content of the exchanges also changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Previously, it was just sparring and sharing insights and experiences in spellcasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Now, there was an additional segment of critiquing mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo would take out the mechanical constructs they made in Chen Cha's workshop, such as the Explosive Monkeys, and review them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">After examining them, Ning Zhuo would critique the Explosive Monkeys one by one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Every time he pointed out deficiencies, he did so in a simple and understandable manner, enlightening the creators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo would also tell them how to make the constructs better and faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This behavior greatly benefited his fellow reformation team members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">As a result, Ning Zhuo's authority in everyone's eyes was thoroughly solidified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">When encountering mechanical constructs that met the standards, Ning Zhuo would take out spirit stones and purchase them at market price on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Seeing their mechanical constructs being purchased by Ning Zhuo, the creators would stand tall with pride.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">If there were any innovative gadgets, Ning Zhuo would also take out pills or spirit food for exchange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This higher level of recognition made the young cultivators who received such treatment elated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhou Zeshen sat in a corner, watching the bustling scene, his eyes flashing with brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Surrounded by stars, Ning Zhuo has completely mastered this team."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"And in the Ning family's reformation team, the main branch members are few, with the side branches being the majority. This means that Ning Zhuo has essentially become the actual controller of the Ning family's reformation team." Since being summoned by the Zhou family patriarch and ordered to build a good relationship with Ning Zhuo, Zhou Zeshen had been actively inviting Ning Zhuo, trying to increase their meeting frequency and foster cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">However, Ning Zhuo had been focused on intense cultivation these days, rejecting all of Zhou Zeshen's invitations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zhou Zeshen was persistent, and seeing that constant rejection was not a solution, Ning Zhuo told Zhou Zeshen that he organized a reformation team exchange meeting every five days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">If Zhou Zeshen was interested, he could come for a chat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Otherwise, he would have to wait for seven days when Ning Zhuo would go out to visit the Orphanage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhou Zeshen decisively participated, finding a corner in the courtyard to sit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He observed coldly and soon noticed someone among the Ning family who was out of place with the enthusiastic atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Itâ€™s Ning Ji, Ning Zhuo's cousin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">For a small figure like Ning Ji, Zhou Zeshen originally wouldn't pay special attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But Zhou Zeshen remembered all the information about Ning Zhuo, so he knew about Ning Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"This guy once asked for a share of the rewards when Ning Zhuo was heavily rewarded by the main branch, wanting to borrow Ning Zhuo's Magical Artifact for cultivation." "He was sternly refused by Ning Zhuo." Zhou Zeshen looked at Ning Zhuo, admiring him in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">So far, Ning Zhuo's handling was impeccable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">If Ning Zhuo had relented at that time, he would have fallen into a pit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Such unconditional help would only fuel others' greed, leading to endless entanglement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">How could someone like Ning Ji ever be satisfied?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Similarly, it would encourage many similar people to swarm and cling to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Over time, even the largest family business would suffer significant losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">On the surface, it might seem like gaining people's hearts and a flourishing scene, but it was all an illusion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Once Ning Zhuo stopped helping, those who had benefited would feel disappointed, leading to resentment and even hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Therefore, Ning Zhuo's initial firm refusal was very clean and decisive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Next, his actions were even more crucial!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo directed his fellow students to participate in the creation of Explosive Monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">And the produced mechanical monkeys were inspected and evaluated by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He then used spirit stones to purchase most of them, with additional rewards for a few outstanding ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Through these measures, although Ning Zhuo still expended resources, it was not a gratuitous expenditure, not a free giveaway to those who only wanted to take without effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This created a positive cycle, and more importantly, established the team's foundationâ€”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Fairness and justice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Every comment Ning Zhuo made was public and clear, leading to clear rewards and punishments, transparency, and an atmosphere of fairness, attracting more people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhou Zeshen looked at Ning Zhuo, who was speaking eloquently with a dangerous smile, and found it hard to believe that Ning Zhuo was once a marginal figure from a side branch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Such a person should have been nurtured by the family from a young age, taught directly by the elders!" "This is the knowledge and methods of a cultivator groomed as an heir from a young age." Who would have thought Ning Zhuo had such a foundation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhou Zeshen pondered, "Ning Zhuo is very good at hiding his sharpness. He hid it too well!" "It was precisely because they didn't expect him to be such a person that the Ning family's main branch suffered a great loss this time." Understandable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">A normal sixteen-year-old cultivator would have spent most of their life in school.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">What would they know?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Especially Ning Zhuo, who lost his parents at a young age and was raised by his uncle, always enduring harsh treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"How could he have such knowledge, such vision, such means?" Zhou Zeshen couldn't understand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He believed that the main branch of the Ning family suffered a great defeat mainly because they underestimated Ning Zhuo, thinking they could easily deal with him with such a scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">As a result, Ning Zhuo easily resolved it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo avoided the pit, organized his fellow students, and then turned the tables, intervening in the black market, causing the main branch of the Ning family to lose out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Now, Ning Zhuo had become the master of the black market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">At sixteen, a Qi Refining Stage Level 3 master of the black market!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He also commanded nearly twenty Foundation Establishment cultivators, and these Foundation Establishment cultivators were not ordinary; they were elites among the Foundation Establishment cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo's series of actions made Zhou Zeshen deeply admire and exclaim in amazement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zhou Zeshen, who loved long-term strategies, greatly enjoyed such intellectual confrontations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">In his view, the strategic games of the righteous path were far more interesting, deeper, and more meaningful than bloody battles with real swords and spears, and more worth savoring!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Among the Qi Refining geniuses of the four major forces in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, only Ning Zhuo and I are the same; we are the same kind of people!" Zhou Zeshen's favorability towards Ning Zhuo greatly increased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He admired Ning Zhuo and was also quite envious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Ning Zhuo's current power is no different from that of an elder!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Although I have talent, I am constrained everywhere in the family. Even as the son of an elder, I am not free." "How can I be as glorious as Ning Zhuo?" "More importantly, the benefits!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Ning Zhuo now gains the benefits of the black market."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Oh, right. These reformation team members also follow Ning Zhuo's lead. These are his manpower, at his disposal!" After critiquing all the mechanical constructs, Ning Zhuo began to share his insights on spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Zhou Zeshen listened quietly, becoming increasingly astonishedâ€”Ning Zhuo's talent was not only in mechanical constructs but also in traditional spells, where he had terrifying comprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The top five on the ranking list were all from the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Zhou and Zheng families knew nothing about the rewards for the ranking list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The more Zhou Zeshen listened, the more engrossed he became, and a look of fascination gradually appeared on his face, his mouth slightly upturned, unable to contain his joy at the unexpected gains from this session.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">When it came to the Q&amp;A session, Zhou Zeshen also participated, asking several questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo carefully considered each question before providing detailed answers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Zhou Zeshen was deeply moved and gained a lot, sincerely expressing his gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">This made the other Ning family cultivators feel proud, believing that Ning Zhuo had "conquered" the Zhou family genius with his personal talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Zhou Zeshen did not just take; he was very clear that he was here to show himself and build a relationship with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">During the exchange, he also shared his insights on spellcasting and actively invited Ning Zhuo to a public mechanical construct duel in front of everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others were all excited and expectant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo only thought for a moment before decisively agreeing, "Then please, Brother Zhou, do not hold back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He had always wanted to compete with Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu, to learn the techniques of the Mudflow Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Now, Zhou Zeshen had taken the initiative to propose it, which was exactly what Ning Zhuo wanted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">How could Ning Zhuo refuse?</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
