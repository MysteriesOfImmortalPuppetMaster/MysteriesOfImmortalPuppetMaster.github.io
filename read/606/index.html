<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Outside Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Sun Lingtong’s cavalry squad was surrounded on all sides. The situation was dire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Their enemies were formidable - led by a commander at the Golden Core stage, with a company of elite ghost soldiers, all at least Foundation Establishment level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Sun Lingtong could also sense numerous hidden forces nearby. No fewer than a dozen Golden Core auras were being deliberately leaked, clearly meant to intimidate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The bull-riders instinctively closed ranks around Sun Lingtong, prepared to throw their lives away at a single word from him, buying time for him to escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">But there was no chance of surviving a breakout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Though Sun Lingtong had entered the Underworld only with his soul, that soul was still a crucial part of his life. The ghost generals of the underworld were masters of all manner of soul-capturing arts - relentless, boundless, and endlessly varied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">If his soul were captured, the consequences would be disastrous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Boss!” Ning Zhuo fretted from the living world, anxious and helpless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">But Sun Lingtong remained quick-witted, even with death looming. He sent back a reassuring thought. “Don’t worry, little brother. Watch me handle this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Then he took on a fawning smile and stepped forward. “Sir, we’re not outsiders, truly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Here, have a look at this. It should clear everything up.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He pulled out a token and held it up for the enemy commander to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Golden Core ghost general froze. “What’s your connection to General Luo Si?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It was the token Luo Si had given him to facilitate enlistment and ease his way into the Underworld ranks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong put on an air of secrecy. “Let’s just say it’s a close relationship. Otherwise, why would Lord Luo personally grant me this token, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The ghost general fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Luo Si was a commanding officer, currently in high favor - not someone to offend lightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Even in the Underworld, the cultivation nations operated under strict hierarchy and order. Ghosts who broke the rules often faced the torments of the Eighteen Hells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The ghost general took the token, examined it closely, and, once he was sure it was genuine, tossed it back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Go on, get out of here. We won’t take you in this time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“But stay away from Water Burial Valley!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“You got lucky today. Come again and you’ll be arrested, no matter who you know.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth and sent a cautious thought: “But I’m on a mission. Might you make an exception? Name your price - we can talk.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Impudent!” the ghost general barked through a mental voice transmission. “You dare try to bribe me!? The order came from our lord himself - if I accept your offer, you’re putting my life in jeopardy!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Realizing there was no room for negotiation, Sun Lingtong hastily apologized and made a swift retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He led his cavalry away from the area - but didn’t withdraw completely. Instead, he circled around Water Burial Valley, racking his brain for a way to break through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“We have to meet Ash Bone Elder. Without him, this can’t move forward.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Damn it! No wonder the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord rules this place - his control is airtight.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“What now, Zhuo?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Having exhausted every idea, Sun Lingtong finally turned to Ning Zhuo for help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo’s brow was furrowed with worry. He was just as stuck. “We can’t risk sneaking in. If the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord sent his personal guard, then he’s definitely set up layers of formations too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Boss, if worst comes to worst… just come back.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“To be honest, the crisis in White Paper Immortal City wasn’t caused by us. At worst, we just didn’t play along. We can always help evacuate a few civilians to make up for it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Back when Sun Lingtong was in danger just now, Ning Zhuo had been scared out of his wits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This wasn’t like Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Back on Fire Persimmon Mountain. If things went wrong back then, he could always break Sun Lingtong out of jail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">But in the Underworld? He wouldn’t even know where to begin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Compared to fulfilling his mother’s plans - or her dying wish - he cared far more about keeping Sun Lingtong safe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Just as Sun Lingtong was sighing heavily, black snow began to fall from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">On closer inspection, every flake was actually ash from burnt paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Heaven-bestowed Talisman pressed against Sun Lingtong’s chest was activated by the snowfall. A warm current surged forth, soaking into his soul and steadily increasing his cultivation foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">At first, Sun Lingtong was wary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After all, every time black snow descended, it usually triggered swarms of ghosts to appear and fight over its blessings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But this time, he waited and waited - yet no ghosts emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“That’s strange… No, wait - it’s not strange at all!” Sun Lingtong suddenly turned, eyes flashing toward Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“They must’ve purged all the nearby ghosts in advance!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">A chill bloomed in Sun Lingtong’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Whoever was behind this had planned everything meticulously and acted with ruthless precision. The fact they’d just let him go - he truly had brushed past death itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“This isn’t a place we can linger in. Boss, come back already,” Ning Zhuo said, having reached the same conclusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong sighed and was just about to retreat when he suddenly yanked the reins and brought his mount to a halt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Wait!” His eyes shone with sharp light, so bright they were hard to look at directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Huh?” Ning Zhuo was surprised too.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Before them, on the stone face of the mountain, flakes of black snow had gathered and begun to swirl midair. Slowly, they coalesced into a rough humanoid figure made of ash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">From its hollow eye sockets, twin ghostfires flared to life. The figure turned to Sun Lingtong and spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“You are the one tied to the shift in fate in the living world?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“…Hmm. So only your soul has entered the Underworld.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">With a single glance, the ash-formed humanoid saw through the nature of Sun Lingtong’s presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sun Lingtong’s face was filled with caution. “Who are you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The figure gave a low chuckle. “You’ve likely guessed already. That’s right - I am the Ash Bone Elder you seek.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Still on guard, Sun Lingtong asked, “How do I know you’re telling the truth?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The ash figure raised one finger and uttered just three words - words that made both Sun and Ning instantly believe him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Meng Yaoyin,” he said - Ning Zhuo’s mother’s name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Some of the tension eased from Sun Lingtong’s face. “In that case, please - enlighten us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ash Bone Elder’s ash avatar responded crisply through spiritual transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord has been plotting for nearly a century. Disrupting his grand plan will not be easy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Fortunately, we’ve also spent many years preparing. We are not acting rashly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“When the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual concludes, the Heavenly Ghost Skull will be fully refined. We must disrupt the ritual before that moment arrives.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“To break through to the altar of the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual at the final moment, three conditions must be met. Let me explain them in detail.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“First, the soul foundation of at least one million souls.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Second, enough baleful energy to suppress it all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“The third condition is a fate strong enough to withstand divine retribution!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun Lingtong's eyes widened. What Ash Bone Elder had just revealed didn’t completely align with the information Meng Yaoyin had left behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He immediately raised a hand. “Hold on!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“To break into the final altar, doesn’t that mean we’ll have to face the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord directly?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“And what’s this about divine retribution? We’re trying to foil a wicked scheme - shouldn’t that be a righteous act? Why would we be punished by the heavens for doing good?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo cut in, “Boss, maybe ask him why he’s helping us in the first place - why go up against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun Lingtong nodded slightly, then added, “Senior Ash Bone, I honestly don’t understand. Why would you want to oppose the ruler of a whole prefecture? Do you have some grudge against him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The ash figure let out a hearty laugh, shook its head, and replied through spiritual transmission, “No grudge. No hatred.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“But I have a far greater reason to do so!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“I am a cultivator of divination. I walk the path of prophecy, guided by the will of Heaven and Earth. My discipline seeks to unveil the hidden workings of fate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“The Heavenly Ghost has long perished, and now they intend to forcibly resurrect it, even if only partially. That alone is a violation of the natural order. That’s the first reason.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is already immensely gifted. As ruler of this region, he should have accepted his limits - but he is not content. He wants more, to go beyond what fate allows. That’s the second reason.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“To refine the Heavenly Ghost Skull, he devised the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual. He intends to bribe the Underworld’s heavens by sacrificing something belonging to the heavens of the living world - namely, the entirety of White Paper Immortal City. Such an act is demonic in nature and a gross affront to the celestial order. That’s the third reason.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“He once used a personal favor to coerce me. Then he entered the valley himself and forced me to conceal the fate of White Paper Immortal City. Now he’s even found a way to imprison me here in Water Burial Valley. That’s the fourth.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“These four reasons are more than enough to justify my full opposition to him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“At the end of the day, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and I walk different paths.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“I follow Heaven’s mandate. He seeks to defy it. That’s not just a difference of philosophy - it is a clash of Dao!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“Clash of Dao…” Sun Lingtong repeated softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">From a distance, Ning Zhuo turned the phrase over in his mind. For the first time, he felt he had truly glimpsed the higher realms of cultivation - where ideology itself could spark conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Seeing that Sun Lingtong’s trust was beginning to take root, Ash Bone Elder continued, “Now let me answer your earlier two questions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“You very well might face the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord directly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“At the ritual’s final stage, the Lord himself will likely be stationed at the altar. But it’s not guaranteed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“When the time comes, we can divide our forces. One group will strike his main base - the Forgetful River Prefecture Hall - to force him into retreat. The other will lead a direct assault on the altar.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“Whether or not we succeed in luring him away, he’ll be devoting most of his power to sustaining the ritual. His strength will be greatly diminished.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Hearing this, Sun Lingtong’s brow furrowed even deeper. He pressed for the most critical detail. “To what level will his power drop? That makes all the difference!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ash Bone Elder replied, “I can guarantee he won’t be at peak Nascent Soul stage. But at minimum, he’ll still be at the Nascent Soul level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“Nascent Soul? Just us against that?” Sun Lingtong looked visibly troubled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ash Bone Elder said, “You’re underestimating the pressure the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is already under.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“He’s stirring up too much commotion. The other Prefecture Lords around him won’t sit by and let him ascend uncontested.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“That’s why he’s taken numerous precautions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“One of them is this: to even reach the altar, one must pass the ritual’s test.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“If you lack sufficient soul foundation, baleful energy, and fate - forget setting foot on the altar.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“But don’t worry. Since you’re the harbinger of change in the living world’s fate, you’re naturally the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s nemesis. Meeting the three conditions should be easy for you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“Just look - the Heaven-bestowed Talisman you carry is already boosting your foundation. Soon, you’ll surpass the threshold of a million souls.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“As for baleful energy, that’s even easier. You can use military balefire. You may not have it now, but you can find it in White Paper Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“As for fate… hmm?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">At this point, Ash Bone Elder’s ash avatar paused, fingers moving in a quick calculation. His expression shifted sharply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He stared at Sun Lingtong. “Your fate… You’re not the destined savior!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Sun Lingtong shrugged. “Of course not. I was just sent to help. I’ll report back truthfully - rest assured on that, senior.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ash Bone Elder stared at the Heaven-bestowed Talisman in Sun Lingtong’s hand. “That talisman - was something I carefully calculated and prepared specifically for the Savior.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Sun Lingtong blinked. “Well, to be honest with you, Senior, our Savior has already reached the million-soul threshold a while ago.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“And as for baleful energy, he’s even fought in a major civil war before. He’s probably already met that condition too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The old man nodded first. “As they say, man proposes, but Heaven disposes. So long as the deviation doesn’t affect the outcome, there’s no harm done.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Then he shook his head. “No, baleful energy isn’t that simple.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“To break through to the sacrificial altar in the end, you must possess the appropriate kind of baleful energy. Without it, you won’t be acknowledged. That’s why the best option is to gather the baleful energy of war in White Paper Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“Forgetful River Prefecture intends to blood-sacrifice White Paper Immortal City to fulfill his own selfish ambitions. In doing so, he’s practically handed his weakness over to the Heavenly Mandate of the living realm. Every gain must be paid for - this is the mystery of fate!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“If you gather military baleful energy, it will strengthen the power of your battle formations. When the time comes, you’ll lead a true army to storm the Underworld, escort the Savior to the altar, and shatter Forgetful River Prefect’s centuries of scheming.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Sun Lingtong waved him off. “Back to the army again. Senior Ash Bone, where would we even get an army? Even if we pulled together a legion of paper soldiers, they’d have no ranks or formations - no way to use proper battle tactics.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">But Ash Bone Elder seemed full of confidence. “Yes, building a real army is incredibly difficult. But rest assured - Heaven’s mandate in the living world will surely deliver the opportunity right into your hands.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Sun Lingtong asked, “Then can you divine it for us, Senior?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The elder shook his hand firmly. “Impossible. My own fate has already been greatly depleted. When Forgetful River Prefect called in his favor from me earlier, it was specifically to drain my fate power - to keep me from being used by others.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“Don’t worry. When the time is right, the army will come.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">With those words, the ash avatar dispersed on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Sun Lingtong stared blankly. “Hey, wait, Senior, don’t just leave like that!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">There was no answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Deflated, he turned to Ning Zhuo. “Why do I feel like it wouldn’t have made a difference whether we talked to him or not?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo replied, “No, we actually gained something important. At the very least, we now know how to move forward.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Sun Lingtong frowned. “Aren’t you worried he might be tricking us?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo smiled. “My ring hasn’t reacted at all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Sun Lingtong let out a small laugh. “Alright then. If this is what you want to do, Little Zhuo, let’s do it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The two came to an agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Li Xiangshang’s heart sank. “So that’s the Sun Clan’s stance? They don’t want to obstruct Sun Tiesheng - they’re secretly backing him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">“What do we do now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Director Zheng wore a troubled expression. “Given how firmly Sun Tiesheng has chosen his path, the Sun Clan’s reaction is… understandable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Li Xiangshang faced a dilemma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Sun Tiesheng was practically the only viable candidate. If he refused, how could Li Xiangshang complete the task assigned by the Dragon Sovereign?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">He turned to Director Zheng for advice. After a moment’s thought, the director said, “The Sun Clan’s current stance is simply because they believe there’s no other competition.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">“If Shen Bing or Chen Sui were still around, they’d probably have forced Sun Tiesheng to accept the demon seed already.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“So why not pretend to choose someone else? Put up a front to pressure them, stir their sense of urgency.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Li Xiangshang considered the suggestion. “That’s not a bad idea. But who should I choose?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Director Zheng shook his head - this was a decision Li Xiangshang had to make himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">With the question still turning in his mind, Li Xiangshang stepped out of the Vigorous Yang Manor - and ran straight into Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">In that instant, an idea flashed through his mind. “Yes. Let’s pick Jiao Ma!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">He approached Qing Chi. “Miss Qing, you’ve been trying to meet with Jiao Ma, haven’t you? I can help you. So long as your strength is sufficient and your influence strong enough, the entire White Paper Immortal City will stand with you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Qing Chi replied calmly, “My strength is already sufficient. In a short time, it’s not easy to raise my cultivation further.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Li Xiangshang smiled. “Cultivation may be slow, but combat power is another matter. As it happens, I have a special aptitude resource - enough to help you build a temporary army.”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
