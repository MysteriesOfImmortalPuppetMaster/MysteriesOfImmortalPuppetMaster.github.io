<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Little Contention Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="2">Inside Cave Residence No. 281.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo held a small hammer, striking the White Surface Golden Steel repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This metallic material was incredibly tough, with its surface glowing white under the light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">As Ning Zhuo hammered away, he performed the artifact refining incantation, continuously infusing his mana into the metal, causing the White Surface Golden Steel to soften slightly, making it easier to strike and shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Once the hammering was complete, Ning Zhuo controlled his divine sense to manipulate three to five mechanical floating hands, which stretched out their palms and aimed at the White Surface Golden Steel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Five streams of fire shot onto the White Surface Golden Steel, heating it until it turned red and softened quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">One by one, small runes, no larger than a fingertip, flickered in silver-gray hues, faintly appearing within the White Surface Golden Steel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo directed his mana, embedding a scripture into the White Surface Golden Steel, successfully transforming it into a restriction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He then activated the Floating Ice Jade Hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Floating Ice Jade Hands gently floated above the White Surface Golden Steel. The other five mechanical floating hands ceased spraying flames and retreated to the sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The ten delicate fingers of the Floating Ice Jade Hands moved swiftly, emanating a misty frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This frost was extremely delicate, slowly cooling the White Surface Golden Steel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">If the typical cooling method were used, the White Surface Golden Steel would develop countless cracks on its surface when suddenly submerged in cold water. If such a situation occurred, the process would have to start all over again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Once the White Surface Golden Steel had fully cooled, it floated mid-air in the form of a long, flat strip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo took out some tea uranium.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Three mechanical floating hands used an invisible force to lift the tea uranium into the air. The hands then emitted flames from their palms once again, burning the tea uranium.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The tea uranium slowly melted, turning into a pool of uranium liquid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo applied his artifact refining technique, removing impurities from the uranium liquid, further purifying it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Once this step was completed, he used his divine sense to directly shape the uranium liquid. He gradually formed it into a straight line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">While the uranium was still cooling, Ning Zhuo quickly retrieved the White Surface Golden Steel and wrapped the uranium around it, connecting the front and back ends.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Finally, he cast another incantation, placing restrictions over the tea uranium.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Another Vajra Mirror," Ning Zhuo muttered in satisfaction after inspecting it and storing it in his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The refining technique for the Vajra Mirror came from the Transmission Bell and was part of the Foundation Establishment stage Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique taught by the Three Major Sect Masters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The cultivation of the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique required external artifacts for support. The technique's instructions included methods for crafting eight types of mirror-like magical artifacts. The Vajra Mirror was one of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">During his time at Cloud concealment  Mountain, Ning Zhuo had competed in Divine Sense with Sun Lingtong, but he had lost. The gap between them was still vast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo had explained the truth to Sun Lingtong—he needed mechanical constructs to assist him in unleashing the full power of the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, which could significantly expand his divine sense range.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">At Misty Hidden Mountain, besides running around, Ning Zhuo had been studying the refining methods for these mirror artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After careful study, he discovered that the refining technique for the Vajra Mirror was relatively simple, with straightforward steps, and the materials required were the easiest to obtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Thus, after arriving at Little Contention Peak, he had begun refining the Vajra Mirror whenever he had time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This was already the third Vajra Mirror he had crafted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The Vajra Mirror is straightforward; it doesn't require a specific refining environment. But for the next mirror, I won't be able to manage it with just my hands," Ning Zhuo thought to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He needed a proper refining furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Although the refining cabin in the Wandering Dragon of Ten Thousand Miles could be used, it consumed too much energy, making it a waste of resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo was also unwilling to rent an external artifact refining workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">In unfamiliar places, he felt uneasy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Although the Myriad Medicine Sect was a large sect with a good reputation, it was still made up of people. And where there are people, there is human nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The sect members in charge of various duties often took advantage of outsiders like Ning Zhuo. This was evident from how the sect members responsible for assigning cave residences accepted bribes without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">This was a form of local oppression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">External artifact refining workshops also posed the risk of leaking refining secrets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the Lava Immortal Palace, although the Transmission Bell echoed all throughout the cities, Ning Zhuo was the only one who had obtained the Foundation Establishment level techniques from the Three Major Sect Masters. Until the Transmission Bell was deciphered internally, only Ning Zhuo possessed these techniques, so he was cautious in protecting them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo did not indulge in artifact refining excessively. Once his refining session concluded, he returned to his daily cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The three major techniques of Buddhism, Daoism, and the Demonic Sect were practiced alternately, steadily advancing Ning Zhuo's cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Currently, Ning Zhuo's cultivation was progressing at a good pace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">On one hand, he had innate talent and had good comprehension. On the other hand, he never hesitated to invest resources in his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Even while inside his cave residence, Ning Zhuo would frequently add extra spirit stones to ensure the concentration of spiritual energy during his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Halfway through his cultivation, one of his mechanical flying birds suddenly started chirping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo knew the time had come, so he opened a gap in the cave's protective formation, allowing Sun Lingtong to enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Over the past few days, Sun Lingtong had been going out every day, either hiding in plain sight or disguising himself, continuously gathering information from various places.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Since the information was collected firsthand, it was far more detailed and reliable than what could be bought. Thanks to this intelligence, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had gained a deeper understanding of Myriad Medicine Valley over the past few days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Myriad Medicine Valley was surrounded by mountains on all sides, with a flat valley in the center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The four mountains were named Herb Field Mountain, Little Contention Peak, Great Contention Peak, and Original Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Herb Field Mountain was filled with terraced fields, each layer growing different medicinal herbs. It could be said that herbs were everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Little Contention Peak housed a large number of outsider cultivators, each of whom had come seeking something different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Great Contention Peak had the Myriad Demon Cave, where many battles had taken place, staining the green mountains with blood. However, no significant demon threats had occurred there for many years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Lastly, Original Mountain was not originally part of Myriad Medicine Valley but had been moved from elsewhere when the Myriad Medicine Sect relocated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The one who relocated this mountain was the mountain god of Original Mountain, whose strength was immense! Through his natural talents, he had achieved the level of moving mountains. However, overexerting his power left him in a state of prolonged slumber after the relocation, rarely responding to the calls of his followers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The reason the Myriad Medicine Sect went to such great lengths and expense to relocate here was due to the extraordinary environment of Myriad Medicine Valley, which boasted an abundance of spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Beneath the valley flowed a wide underground river, rich in spiritual energy and part of the Water Element spiritual vein.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The springs throughout Myriad Medicine Valley were all spirit springs. The reason Myriad Medicine Sect produced such vast quantities of herbs was due to the ample irrigation provided by the spirit springs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Original Mountain served as the sect's primary base, filled with various palaces, pavilions, and other buildings, making it the sect's main residential area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">This area had the strictest defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Great Contention Peak, in contrast, had the weakest defenses due to the numerous wars fought there. Every inch of its soil had been soaked with the blood of both demon and human cultivators. As a result, Great Contention Peak was considered an inauspicious place with too much killing energy, unsuitable for growing medicinal herbs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Little Contention Peak, on the other hand, was where Myriad Medicine Sect housed outside cultivators, who varied greatly in their ambitions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The valley in the center, surrounded by the four mountains, was Myriad Medicine Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The terrain in the valley was flat, the soil fertile, and spirit springs were as numerous as the stars, their waters intersecting to form many irrigation channels. This valley was home to the Myriad Medicine Sect's most valuable and rare medicinal herbs, protected by the Six Harmony Longevity Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">In comparison, the herbs on Herb Field Mountain were primarily for mass production and external trade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
