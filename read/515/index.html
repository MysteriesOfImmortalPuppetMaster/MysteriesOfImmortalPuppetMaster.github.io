<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The steel torrent shook the heavens and earth, like a wild, gigantic python, charging into the forest of a thousand peaks.<br/>
<br/>
Boom, boom, boom……<br/>
<br/>
Mountain after mountain collapsed in turn under the iron torrent.<br/>
<br/>
Each time, a tremendous shock was created, yet before the splashing rocks and billowing smoke could rise, they were ruthlessly crushed by the subsequent iron torrent!<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul cultivators on the battlefield, seen from afar, were all struck with awe by the sight.<br/>
<br/>
"Iron Flow Levels the Plains —what an apt name for this military tactic. It truly lives up to its name," Mountain Master said sincerely.<br/>
<br/>
Standing beside him was his Dao partner, Floating Cloud Master.<br/>
<br/>
Floating Cloud Master nodded slightly and sighed, "Du Tiechuan, you truly are one of our country's top generals."<br/>
<br/>
These two Nascent Soul cultivators were two famous unaligned cultivators from the Two Note Nation, their combat strength outstanding. Before the Two Note Nation deployed their troops, the military had secretly recruited them with a large sum of money. Not long ago, when the Three Generals Battalion, the Golden Halberd Army, the Red Flower Battalion, and the Barbarian Demon Battalion marched into the Thousand Peaks Forest, they had been accompanying them all along to provide escort.<br/>
<br/>
On a mountain peak on the other side, a graceful female cultivator also gazed intently as the steel torrent quickly receded.<br/>
<br/>
She was dressed in a plain white brocade robe, with a silver chain tied around her waist, bearing an exquisite jade bottle, and wearing a pair of jade-colored embroidered shoes.<br/>
<br/>
Her features were delicate, and her long hair was as black as ink; she was none other than Shen Qinghe.<br/>
<br/>
"I hope that Du Tiechuan will achieve a great feat and scatter the allied forces of the Thousand Peaks Forest. In that case, I will be able to venture deep into the forest and exterminate all the poison cultivators."<br/>
<br/>
On a mountain peak at some point on the southeast side of the steel torrent, Zhu Xuanji and Lin Bufan stood side by side.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji remained silent in deep thought.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan, somewhat helpless, tentatively said, "Divine Detective Zhu, our identities are rather sensitive; we must not reveal ourselves carelessly."<br/>
<br/>
Without turning his head, Zhu Xuanji replied lightly, "Leaving aside my identity, I am merely at the Golden Core stage. Since the neighboring country has started a major war, I came to watch the excitement; that's all."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan glared slightly, "But I am at the Nascent Soul stage!"<br/>
<br/>
Once one reached the Nascent Soul stage, every move had far-reaching implications. After all, such individuals possessed formidable strength and, if they so wished, could easily overturn an entire regime.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, if Lin Bufan were to recklessly appear and meddle in the battle, it would be a serious breach of protocol, and he would be targeted for suppression by all the righteous forces of the Two Note Nation, as well as the national powers.<br/>
<br/>
Although Lin Bufan's Myriad Medicine Sect had considerable influence, compared to the Two Note Nation or the various righteous factions within the country, its strength was relatively weak.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, Lin Bufan was very cautious.<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps I should not have delivered any goods to that kid Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan already regretted it.<br/>
<br/>
He had originally intended to leave quickly, but before he could cross the border, he was blocked by Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji invited him to watch the battle together.<br/>
<br/>
What could Lin Bufan do?<br/>
<br/>
Because of the LinLang Mirror Wall, he and his Myriad Medicine Sect had become deeply allied with the Ning family and the Zhu family, forming a steadfast coalition of interests.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Lin Bufan had no choice but to swallow his bitterness and agree to Zhu Xuanji's invitation.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan was very uneasy.<br/>
<br/>
Based on his abilities, it was easy for him to guess that Zhu Xuanji’s secret infiltration into the other country was certainly not just for the sake of watching the excitement.<br/>
<br/>
"I hope Zhu Xuanji’s actions won’t be too drastic; they must not involve me and the Myriad Medicine Sect."<br/>
<br/>
As a righteous cultivator, Lin Bufan naturally had many concerns.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, some cultivators of the demonic path did not have so many concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Because the news of the battle in the Thousand Peaks Forest had long since spread, among the spectators of this battle there were no shortage of demonic cultivators, and many of them were even at the Nascent Soul stage.<br/>
<br/>
Wooden Wheel Town.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali shouted, "Keep up, keep up with the main force!"<br/>
<br/>
His Barbarian Demon Batallion had suffered heavy losses during the ambush, and once again suffered severe casualties during the march into the Thousand Peaks Forest. Even though new recruits had been gathered now, its size was less than half of its peak, and the training was severely inadequate.<br/>
<br/>
Originally, the physical attributes of demonic cultivators and barbaric cultivators were generally higher than those of human cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
However, the difficulty of the five-round trials on the parade ground became increasingly perverse, with each round seeing a great increase in requirements. This led to the Barbarian Demon Batallion being ruthlessly eliminated in the third round.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, Du Tiechuan's deputy general deployed the Iron Skin and Flesh Armor technique, as well as heavy armor and a large quantity of pills, talismans, and other cultivation resources.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali's pockets were empty; he could only watch helplessly.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, he and his Barbarian Demon Batallion could only serve as the rear guard, following the main force to the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Military strategy —the speed of warfare is paramount.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali waved the general's banner, consecutively invoking the military tactic three times, pushing his own limits.<br/>
<br/>
The marching speed of the Barbarian Demon Batallion reached an all-time high.<br/>
<br/>
The speed of the heavy-armored main force was initially unremarkable, but it increased more and more, to such an exaggerated degree that the Barbarian Demon Batallion and Xu Dali could only look on in lamentation.<br/>
<br/>
He had already exerted his utmost effort, but could only watch as the heavy-armored main force moved further away, soon disappearing from sight.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali was not an isolated case.<br/>
<br/>
There were another seven or eight armies suffering similarly.<br/>
<br/>
According to Du Tiechuan's military orders, these armies would also attack in coordination, following the route carved out by the main force to charge forward.<br/>
<br/>
It could be imagined that this would be a bloody path of slaughter.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo found himself amidst the heavy-armored main force, imbued —not, more accurately, carrying —the military tactic "Iron Flow Levels the Plains."<br/>
<br/>
The entire main force was like a torrent of water released from a dam, surging downward from great heights, with gravity accelerating it, impossible to stop!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt as if he were but a droplet in the vast water, carried along by an unparalleled, terrifying force.<br/>
<br/>
This immense force filled his heart with awe.<br/>
<br/>
It was something he had never experienced in his entire life.<br/>
<br/>
He had once been empowered by national might and military strength, but the previous feeling of vigor and being filled with power, compared to now, was like a firefly against the blazing sun!<br/>
<br/>
It was because this was the power of the Soul Formation stage!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt as if he were dashing, and also as if he were being swept along by the current.<br/>
<br/>
He could no longer feel his own body; many of his senses plummeted to rock bottom, becoming blurry. In contrast, he could keenly and clearly sense the people around him, feeling the state of at least three hundred nearby individuals.<br/>
<br/>
It was like a droplet in a surging river, sensing numerous other droplets "companions" around him.<br/>
<br/>
Besides that, he could also see the mountains ahead.<br/>
<br/>
The mountains in his field of vision had also become blurry, like colossal, dark pillars standing between heaven and earth.<br/>
<br/>
Boom! Boom! Boom!<br/>
<br/>
The giant pillars, under the heavy, pitch-black torrent of steel, were toppled one after the other, and then swiftly ground to powder.<br/>
<br/>
Each time he collided with a mountain, Ning Zhuo felt as though he had crashed into an invisible wall.<br/>
<br/>
Then, in the next moment, accompanied by the pain from the collision, Ning Zhuo broke through the invisible wall, feeling suddenly relieved, and was able to continue his unbridled rush!<br/>
<br/>
"Even such colossal mountains could not halt our progress."<br/>
<br/>
"Truly magnificent."<br/>
<br/>
"To be able to participate in such an assault... as our leader would say, it was exhilarating and exciting! This time, joining the troops of the Two Note Nation was truly worthwhile."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s impression of military strategy and the art of warfare became extraordinarily favorable!<br/>
<br/>
"Among the hundred arts of cultivation, the art of warfare excels in rallying the masses!"<br/>
<br/>
"No wonder in history, when military strategists made their move, they directly altered the world order of their time."<br/>
<br/>
"Magnificent, magnificent!"<br/>
<br/>
The Allied Forces of the Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan had played his cards openly, and the Allied Forces of the Thousand Peaks Forest had easily found out, and had promptly deployed their troops to the front line.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long’s face was solemn, and Lu Hongtu furrowed his brows, no longer possessing the composure he once had.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing mountain after mountain collapse, and the unstoppable momentum of the steel torrent, the morale of the allied forces continuously waned, while the troops of the Two Note Nation were filled with soaring morale, becoming even more vigorous.<br/>
<br/>
"We cannot let it continue like this, Master Lu Dong," Lord Long communicated telepathically. "The Two Note Nation’s troops are new and excel at fighting favorable conditions. If Du Tiechuan really creates a situation of overwhelming advantage, it will be extremely unfavorable to our side!"<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu immediately transmitted his thoughts via spirit sense, "Understood."<br/>
<br/>
He waved the military banner in his hand and issued orders.<br/>
<br/>
The four mountain gods on the front line immediately received the order to take action.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain God of the Green Pine was an old man, his face lined with wrinkles, dressed in a long robe, with a beard like verdant pine needles.<br/>
<br/>
His face was ashen, and his heart was filled with regret.<br/>
<br/>
Had he known that the military tactic "Iron Flow Levels the Plains" was so mighty, he would not have responded to the alliance's call and accepted this military service.<br/>
<br/>
"Alas! Now, I can only grit my teeth and press on."<br/>
<br/>
"Red Sleeve Fairy, I beg you."<br/>
<br/>
Standing beside him was a female cultivator, dressed in red with long sleeves and a long skirt. Her body was extremely corpulent, and she stood at a height of nine zhang; just by standing, she resembled a city gate, casting a huge shadow upon the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Red Sleeve Fairy spoke in a soft, beautiful voice, "Very well, Lord Green Pine, safe travels."<br/>
<br/>
Mountain God of the Green Pine immediately twitched his eye, "That blessing is utterly unnecessary."<br/>
<br/>
However, Red Sleeve Fairy rolled up her long sleeves, revealing arms as thick as an ordinary person's thigh.<br/>
<br/>
Pah, pah.<br/>
<br/>
She spat twice into her palm, then rubbed her hands together a few times, causing her palms to turn red.<br/>
<br/>
She flew into the air, transforming herself into a small giant three zhang tall, and grasped a section of a mountainside.<br/>
<br/>
Ha—ya!<br/>
<br/>
Red Sleeve Fairy let out a delicate yet furious roar.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Divine Skill —Move Mountain!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the Green Pine Giant Wood Mountain suddenly vanished from its place.<br/>
<br/>
When it reappeared, it was positioned right in front of the steel torrent.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain God of the Green Pine stood atop the mountain peak, looking down upon the pitch-black, massive waves ahead, his heart trembling slightly.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly spread his arms wide, opening his embrace, giving his all.<br/>
<br/>
Green Pine Array!<br/>
<br/>
Being the Mountain God of the Green Pine and in his own territory, he unleashed his array with incredible speed.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, before entering the formation, he had been empowered by numerous techniques from the allied forces, so the range of his array was enormous, nearly enveloping the entire Green Pine Giant Wood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the Giant Wood Mountain turned a deep green color.<br/>
<br/>
Countless pine trees grew rapidly, their crowns overlapping one another, forming a vast sea of green.<br/>
<br/>
Countless pine needles, in the next moment, shot out like a deep green rain of arrows, targeting the heavy-armored main force head-on.<br/>
<br/>
Under normal circumstances, such a ferocious assault would undoubtedly cause heavy casualties to the army.<br/>
<br/>
But now, that was not the case.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, the main force was clad in heavy armor; on the other, they had been empowered with various military tactics, among which the most important was the "Iron Flow Levels the Plains" technique, further augmented by the Dragon Vein energy of the Two Note Nation!<br/>
<br/>
The sharp arrow rain blasted forth, but only produced tinkling sounds under the layers of dark figures, without causing a single casualty.<br/>
<br/>
Rumbling……<br/>
<br/>
The steel torrent collided with the Green Pine Giant Wood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
This time, Ning Zhuo felt an unprecedented force of impact. His body staggered and fell backward.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, he felt a push from a comrade behind him, quickly restoring his posture.<br/>
<br/>
Reacting to the external world, at the moment the steel torrent hit the mountain, it was momentarily obstructed, forming a reverse current of waves.<br/>
<br/>
But this wave did not even cover the very front, as it was corrected, and an even greater force pushed it back.<br/>
<br/>
The left and right sides of the steel torrent, after the impact, continued to advance around the Giant Wood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The central torrent continuously pounded against the Green Pine Giant Wood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The layers upon layers of pine trees, as fragile as paper, were mercilessly shredded by the steel torrent.<br/>
<br/>
The towering peaks, empowered by the array, trembled violently under the onslaught of the torrent.<br/>
<br/>
Then, cracks sprang across the mountain, which collapsed with a roar, shattering into pieces!<br/>
<br/>
Mountain God of the Green Pine suffered a backlash, spitting out a mouthful of divine blood, nearly falling.<br/>
<br/>
He heaved a long sigh, crushed his teleportation talisman, and quickly withdrew.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain beneath his feet completely collapsed, becoming the main force's first battle achievement.<br/>
<br/>
"Old friend Green Pine couldn’t even hold on for ten breaths," someone remarked. Not far away, Mountain God of White Stone wore a very grim expression.<br/>
<br/>
He was a young and handsome man, wearing a white jade crown and draped in a plain white long robe. But at this moment, his face was even paler than the stone crown and white robe.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you ready?" Red Sleeve Fairy had already teleported here.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain God of White Stone looked toward Red Sleeve, "Fairy, take it easy."<br/>
<br/>
Red Sleeve Fairy grinned and repeated her old trick.<br/>
<br/>
She cooed sweetly as she shouted, "Let's go!"<br/>
<br/>
Divine Skill —Move Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the White Stone Giant Wood Mountain also appeared before the steel torrent.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain God of White Stone let out a low cry, and also opened his array, empowering the entire mountain.<br/>
<br/>
"Behold my Rolling Stone Shaking Mountain Technique!"<br/>
<br/>
Mountain God of White Stone exerted his full power, and countless boulders rolled down from White Stone Mountain, tumbling like an avalanche, fiercely smashing into the iron torrent.<br/>
<br/>
Each boulder carried the force of a thousand jin, striking the steel torrent and producing deafening roars.<br/>
<br/>
Then... every single boulder shattered in the next moment.<br/>
<br/>
The boulders came in endless succession, but they could not stop the steel torrent; at most, they caused some ripples and waves.<br/>
<br/>
Booming……<br/>
<br/>
The steel torrent crashed White Stone Giant Wood Mountain down, which then toppled, crashing onto the ground, shaking the surrounding hundred-li radius severely.<br/>
<br/>
But soon, its massive mountain body quickly disappeared within the steel torrent.<br/>
<br/>
Advance!<br/>
<br/>
The steel torrent surged forward all the way.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go!" Red Sleeve Fairy once again moved a mountain.<br/>
<br/>
This time it was the Iron Deer Giant Wood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
But unlike the previous two mountains, at the request of Mountain God of the Iron Deer, the Giant Wood Mountain appeared on one side of the steel torrent, not confronting it head-on.<br/>
<br/>
"The might of Iron Flow Levels the Plains is unstoppable; only a fool would repeat their mistakes."<br/>
<br/>
Mountain God of the Iron Deer opened his array, covering the Iron Deer Giant Wood Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
His entire being merged into the mountain body.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain trembled, rose up from the earth, and transformed into an immensely colossal Iron Deer Divine Statue.<br/>
<br/>
The Iron Deer bowed its head, and using its many-branched, forest-like antlers as a path, fiercely rammed into the steel torrent from the side.<br/>
<br/>
The Iron Deer Divine Statue charged all the way to the center of the torrent, its limbs unable to support it, and it was toppled by the torrent, roaring as it knelt to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The pitch-black iron torrent violently slammed into its side, causing it to emit a mournful wail.<br/>
<br/>
The surging iron water battered it to a state of innumerable wounds, diminishing it more and more, until it was shattered into fragments and ground into powder.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, the Iron Deer Mountain, which carried a world-shattering aura, had disappeared without a trace under the steel torrent.</div>
