<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
A day earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan flew swiftly, watching the lush green mountains slowly recede beneath his feet.<br/>
<br/>
"Senior, according to the map, we're almost at Jade Steel Mountain," said Han Zhou, sitting beside Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
The two were seated on a giant flying block of ice.<br/>
<br/>
The cold made Han Zhou feel at home, as he originally came from the Northern Lands. This familiarity extended to Ning Jiufan, the master of the flying ice block.<br/>
<br/>
"Jade Steel Mountain is indeed visible in the distance," said Ning Jiufan, whose vision far surpassed Han Zhou's, befitting his Golden Core cultivation level.<br/>
<br/>
He could already see Jade Steel Mountain's silhouette on the horizon.<br/>
<br/>
But just as he began to relax, the world suddenly transformed.<br/>
<br/>
A great formation instantly expanded, enveloping both Ning Jiufan and Han Zhou.<br/>
<br/>
In the blink of an eye, everything returned to normal, as if what had just happened was merely an illusion. Ning Jiufan and Han Zhou had completely vanished.<br/>
<br/>
Three blurry figures appeared, surrounding Ning Jiufan and Han Zhou from a distance.<br/>
<br/>
Trapped in the formation, Ning Jiufan felt both shocked and angry.<br/>
<br/>
The sky had turned a murky yellow, with a sphere of light encompassing all directions.<br/>
<br/>
"Who dares trap me?" Ning Jiufan demanded, "I am Ning Jiufan, the Golden Core Patriarch of the Ning family from Fire Persimmon Mountain. Have you trapped the wrong person?"<br/>
<br/>
A voice came from one of the three figures: "Ning Jiufan, we've finally caught you. You're exactly who we're here to eliminate!"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou was shocked and immediately grew tense. He never expected that traveling with a Golden Core cultivator would lead him into a life-or-death crisis.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's heart sank heavily. Since the enemy had specifically waited for him, their background must be significant.<br/>
<br/>
After some thought, he immediately took out his official seal: "Don't be foolish, being manipulated by others! I am a hidden official of the Southern Bean Kingdom. If you leave now, I promise there will be no consequences."<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, if anything happens to me here, the entire Southern Bean Kingdom will hunt you down."<br/>
<br/>
The enemies laughed heartily: "Ning Jiufan, we're here precisely to kill you, you dog official!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was shocked again.<br/>
<br/>
Since the enemy knew his identity and was still willing to kill an official, it was very likely the Meng family.<br/>
<br/>
After all, since the Ning family had moved to Fire Persimmon Immortal City, their only powerful external enemy was the Meng family.<br/>
<br/>
Besides them, there were those enemies from the North Wind Nation. However, this possibility was far less likely than the Meng family.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou transmitted: "Elder Ning, these three all have Golden Core auras. Why not release your Ape to break through the formation with force!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan shook his head internally. He didn't want to do that.<br/>
<br/>
If this ambush was truly the Meng family's doing, how could they not have prepared for his Nascent Soul level demon beast?<br/>
<br/>
If he really released Elder Ape, they would likely fall into the enemy's trap.<br/>
<br/>
Considering this, Ning Jiufan coldly snorted, both responding to Han Zhou and the enemies: "If that's the case, then let me show you the fighting spirit of a man from the Northern Lands!"<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, the north wind blew, bringing drifting snow, and a bone-chilling cold pervaded everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
"Take my attack!"<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Ning Jiufan spoke, he made his move.<br/>
<br/>
Among the three Golden Core cultivators, one revealed himself and cast a spell to counter the widespread wind and snow.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Jiufan's snow spell was suppressed, he took out a talisman and activated it directly.<br/>
<br/>
The talisman floated in mid-air, burst into bright light, and quickly condensed into a giant ice and snow giant.<br/>
<br/>
The ice giant stood on self-generated snow clouds, wielding a long-handled ice-carved great sword, charging toward another Golden Core enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the ice giant approach, that Golden Core cultivator hurriedly cast spells, continuously suppressing it, delaying its advance.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan, multitasking, shot out a magical treasure-level ice spike toward the third person.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the formidable ice spike coming, that Golden Core cultivator knew ordinary spells couldn't resist it, so he immediately took out a large cauldron.<br/>
<br/>
The cauldron flew forward and collided with the ice spike, making loud clanging sounds, but managed to temporarily block it.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan laughed heartily, full of spirit: "Is this all you three have? Whatever other techniques you have, bring them all out!"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou watched from the side, extremely amazed that this Ning family patriarch could be so dominant fighting against three opponents.<br/>
<br/>
But he quickly thought of Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Like grandfather, like grandson. From Young Master Ning Zhuo's behavior, one can glimpse the excellence and dominance of the Ning family."<br/>
<br/>
"The Ning family's Golden Core patriarch showing such performance was actually foreseeable."<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou then thought about their trump card, the Nascent Soul level Elder Ape, and his heart gradually settled down, no longer so nervous.<br/>
<br/>
What he didn't know was that despite Ning Jiufan's outward appearance, he was actually very nervous inside. Being trapped in the formation meant losing the geographical advantage. Since these three Golden Core cultivators were chosen by the Meng family, they must have some special abilities.<br/>
<br/>
"This place is close to Jade Steel Mountain, if only reinforcements could come."<br/>
<br/>
The guardian of Jade Steel Mountain was no longer Meng Zizhong; the royal Zhu family had sent another Golden Core cultivator to replace him.<br/>
<br/>
Before Ning Jiufan came, he had already sent a flying message, and they had exchanged correspondence once.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Jiufan thought again: "Since they set up an ambush here, how could they not have considered the Golden Core guardian at Jade Steel Mountain?"<br/>
<br/>
"So, any disturbance made within this formation probably won't transmit outside."<br/>
<br/>
"No, if it did transmit outside, it would be even worse. It must be their deliberate plan, wanting to attract the Golden Core guardian to come help, making it convenient to capture us all at once!"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou didn't understand the true situation, as he knew little about Golden Core level beings.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Jiufan's considerations also had their limitations.<br/>
<br/>
Even the three ambushing Golden Core cultivators didn't know that their ambush had already been exposed.<br/>
<br/>
High up in the clouds, Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu stood side by side, overlooking the battle below.<br/>
<br/>
Although the battlefield was enclosed by the formation, Zhu Xuanji used his Heaven's Golden Eyes, combined with spells, to see through to the inside.<br/>
<br/>
Through spiritual sense communication, he let Shen Lingshu know the real-time battle situation.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said: "Senior Shen, it's just as you predicted, Ning Jiufan has indeed fallen into an ambush."<br/>
<br/>
"You even calculated that he would have a close call but ultimately be safe."<br/>
<br/>
"Hehe, with us here, of course he'll be safe despite the danger."<br/>
<br/>
After making some hand seals, Shen Lingshu said: "I've figured out this formation, it's the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon Formation."<br/>
<br/>
"The formation lines and patterns are all woven with nine-tailed fox hair."<br/>
<br/>
"There are eight formation eyes and one formation heart. The heart is hidden among the eyes, appearing identical at first glance, making it difficult to find the crucial position."<br/>
<br/>
"Currently, these three Golden Core cultivators, one occupies the formation heart, two occupy formation eyes, three formation eyes burn soul-confusing incense, one formation eye holds a demon-slaying platform, one formation eye contains demon-binding rope, and the last formation eye surprisingly holds a mysterious qi-catching bag."<br/>
<br/>
"The Nine-Tailed Heavenly Demon has the power to bewitch all demons, using its fox hair to set up formations is quite ambitious."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing this, Zhu Xuanji couldn't help but sigh: "The enemy is well-prepared indeed."<br/>
<br/>
"The soul-confusing incense and demon-bewitching formation can make Elder Ape fall into confusion as soon as it's released, even turning against its master."<br/>
<br/>
"Then, in its confused state, it would walk onto the demon-slaying platform and have its head chopped off."<br/>
<br/>
"At the moment of life and death, Elder Ape might awaken its survival instinct and gain a moment of clarity. So, they also prepared the demon-binding rope to eliminate its last chance of survival."<br/>
<br/>
"What kind of treasure is this mysterious qi-catching bag?"<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu explained: "This treasure specifically targets fate and fortune, able to absorb others' luck, making their fortune decline."<br/>
<br/>
"With this treasure present, it can prevent some accidents from happening. Many people with strong fortune often have their luck surge at critical moments, saving themselves."<br/>
<br/>
"Even ordinary people, if their fortune is strong enough, can survive falling off cliffs when their luck surges, and even have good fortune afterward."<br/>
<br/>
"I see." Zhu Xuanji nodded and asked the most crucial question, "Senior Shen, can you calculate any clues or evidence that these three Golden Core cultivators are from the Meng family?"<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu shook his head: "I can't calculate that."<br/>
<br/>
"This might be Meng Kui's handiwork, very meticulous. From the very beginning of planning, he already guarded against divination."<br/>
<br/>
"Can't you trace their origins? Can't you see their connection to the Meng family?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji smiled bitterly: "I only see these three accepting this mission at the Shadow Thorn Pavilion."<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Thorn Pavilion was a famous assassination organization, very secretive, with branches in various cultivation nations large and small.<br/>
<br/>
With such a large scale and ability to exist for so long, they naturally had deep foundations.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji being able to identify at first glance that the three Golden Core cultivators were all members of the Shadow Thorn Pavilion already lived up to his name as the divine investigator.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu smiled slightly, but wasn't surprised: "The Meng family's move this time is probably revenge for the Jade Steel Mountain incident."<br/>
<br/>
"We removed Meng Zizhong, so they set up this ambush here to eliminate Ning Jiufan as a warning."<br/>
<br/>
"If both Ning Jiufan and Elder Ape are sacrificed, the power balance in Fire Persimmon Immortal City will tilt toward Meng Kui's side, leaving the Zhou family unable to stand alone."<br/>
<br/>
"And in court, the sacrifice of these two will deeply affect people's hearts, greatly weakening the royal family's prestige!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said, "The fortunes of Ning Zhuo and the Ning family seem to have hit rock bottom and are due for a reversal. Our plan was to come to Foggy Hidden Mountain to investigate the Fox God, but we stumbled upon something else - we can't just watch Ning Jiufan die in battle."<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu's expression turned solemn: "It looks like this is a coincidence."<br/>
<br/>
"But we can't rule out that this is the work of Life Hanging By a Thread or the Royal Mandate."<br/>
<br/>
"We must save Ning Jiufan, but we might as well observe the battle briefly first, letting his fortune be drained."<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu continued explaining his plan: "If Ning Zhuo has mastered the Life Hanging By a Thread technique, he likely planted it in Ning Jiufan."<br/>
<br/>
"If so, their fortunes are linked. As Ning Jiufan's fortune declines, it will inevitably affect Ning Zhuo's side."<br/>
<br/>
"If Ning Zhuo has planted Life Hanging By a Thread in others, their declining fortunes will manifest as either confused minds or calamities."<br/>
<br/>
"This is an excellent opportunity to verify."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji recalled secrets learned in the royal capital: "Years ago, the Supreme Emperor also suffered a major defeat due to this flaw in Life Hanging By a Thread, nearly losing both country and life."<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in the world is perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Every strength has its weakness.<br/>
<br/>
Every advantage has its disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
Life Hanging By a Thread connected fortunes - when the Supreme Emperor had bad luck and his fortune declined, others shared the burden. This created an effect similar to bearing the Royal Mandate's burden.<br/>
<br/>
But since it wasn't the true Royal Mandate, once everyone faced catastrophe, or if some people's fortunes dropped too severely, the Supreme Emperor would also suffer terrible misfortune.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, this was why the Southern Bean Supreme Emperor faced calamity and nearly died.<br/>
<br/>
"Wait." A thought flashed through Zhu Xuanji's mind, and he asked, "What if the Buddha Heart Demon Seal truly has the power to suppress fortune?"<br/>
<br/>
Shen Lingshu contemplated: "That depends on how powerful the Buddha Heart Demon Seal's fortune-suppressing ability is. Can it only protect himself, or can it benefit others as well?"<br/>
<br/>
"Even if the seal is powerful, Ning Zhuo only has Foundation Establishment cultivation now, so he probably can't unleash its true power. Back then, didn't the Supreme Emperor also have a magical treasure that could suppress his own fortune?"<br/>
<br/>
"In any case, there's no harm in trying."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly: "Very well, let's do it."<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Li Dragon moved swiftly through the void.<br/>
<br/>
Silver lines appeared occasionally under the black curtain.<br/>
<br/>
The lower half of the Ten Thousand Li Dragon's body gleamed with bloody light - this was the Blood Shadow Cave Master's work.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly daylight appeared ahead, and the next moment, the Ten Thousand Li Dragon emerged from the void into the mortal world.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong didn't dare be careless and continued guiding the Ten Thousand Li Dragon into the dense forest.<br/>
<br/>
After maneuvering for half a day, they finally stopped.<br/>
<br/>
"That was dangerous, but exciting!" Sun Lingtong licked his lips as his heartbeat gradually slowed.<br/>
<br/>
He looked down at his hands.<br/>
<br/>
Half of his palms had turned to stone skin, similar to the appearance of the stone sphere in the cave.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth and could only continue using spiritual power to suppress it, then controlled the mechanical dragon to check on Ning Zhuo's condition.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo unconscious but still breathing, Sun Lingtong's eyes reddened, and he wanted to slap himself.<br/>
<br/>
"Taking risks alone for thrills is one thing."<br/>
<br/>
"But this time, I've endangered Little Zhuo. Ah, how could I be so unwise? I truly deserve punishment!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was extremely remorseful but in his current state didn't dare approach Ning Zhuo directly.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Sun Lingtong had considerable expertise in mechanisms. He immediately took out a mechanical puppet and controlled it with his divine sense to indirectly help Ning Zhuo regain consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo woke up and learned they had escaped with their lives, he sighed in relief though still frightened. Sun Lingtong sighed deeply: "Little Zhuo, I almost got you killed because of me."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: "Boss, I was worried about your injuries and privately eager for revenge against the Six Cave Sect, so I didn't stop you from continuing to take risks. I'm also at fault!"<br/>
<br/>
"How are your injuries now?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong told Ning Zhuo truthfully.<br/>
<br/>
He hunched his shoulders and gritted his teeth: "I originally wanted to follow the clues and investigate information about the Stone Elder. Who knew they could see through the Ten Thousand Li Dragon!"<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to hit himself in the head.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back now, what happened?<br/>
<br/>
His love of thrills and pursuit of excitement was his nature, but before this, he had also been too careless.<br/>
<br/>
"Is it because I've lived too long in comfort in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and become lax?"<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, getting myself in trouble is one thing, but if I had gotten Little Zhuo killed..."<br/>
<br/>
"He has immortal potential, a great future ahead, spent over ten years carefully planning, his life was just getting better, he has family and friends, and even female cultivators are interested in him. Unlike me who's all alone - if he had died here because of me..."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was filled with remorse and secretly warned himself that in the future, whenever Ning Zhuo was with him, he must never take such risks.<br/>
<br/>
This escape experience deeply touched Sun Lingtong's heart.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the whole process, Ning Zhuo was indeed endangered because of Sun Lingtong. If he had been in the dragon's head cabin and discovered the stone sphere in the cave, he certainly wouldn't have rushed to mine it like Sun Lingtong did.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo was used to it.<br/>
<br/>
In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he had many times reached out to bail Sun Lingtong out of prison.<br/>
<br/>
His deep friendship with Sun Lingtong wasn't just about being able to entrust their backs to each other without hesitation in life-or-death moments. It went deeper‚Äîeven when the other person made mistakes, he would easily forgive them and even make excuses for them.<br/>
<br/>
So Ning Zhuo consoled him: "While Nascent Soul cultivators can traverse the void, they can only do so with their Soul - it's very difficult to bring their physical bodies along."<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Nascent Soul cultivators are very hard to completely kill. Even if their physical bodies are destroyed, their Nascent Soul can escape and enter the void, seeking opportunities to possess new bodies and return for revenge.<br/>
<br/>
"But the Ten Thousand Li Dragon can carry us together through the void. Even if those Nascent Soul cultivators wanted to chase us, they probably wouldn't risk separating their Nascent Soul from their bodies to pursue us."<br/>
<br/>
A cultivator's Nascent Soul represents their lifetime of cultivation and future path - it's extremely important. Unless absolutely necessary, they won't easily risk their Nascent Soul.<br/>
<br/>
"Isn't this why we were able to explore the Six Cave Sect in the first place?"<br/>
<br/>
"Our successful escape this time proves this point. If the Demon Heart Cave Master really wanted to abandon his physical body and chase us with his Nascent Soul, the other two Cave Masters would probably have attacked his body."<br/>
<br/>
"Boss..."<br/>
<br/>
"We also gained a lot from this venture. For example, I saw the mechanical carriage my mother once rode in, and I know Lin You will get it. I must take that carriage back!"<br/>
<br/>
"Without this adventure, how would I have learned such important news?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shook his head and spoke through the puppet: "Little Zhuo, you don't need to comfort me. We suffered significant losses this time. The Ten Thousand Li Dragon was attacked by the Demon Heart Cave Master earlier, about thirty percent needs repairs."<br/>
<br/>
"The rear half of the mechanical dragon body was infected by the blood shadow. This must be the Blood Shadow Cave Master's tracking method. If we can't remove it, whenever we approach Ten Thousand Peaks Forest in the future, the Blood Shadow Cave Master will detect us."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head and slowly sat up: "None of that matters, Boss. The urgent matter now is treating your injury."<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo..." Even though Sun Lingtong had spent over ten years with Ning Zhuo, he felt a warmth spread through his heart at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: "But now, the mechanical dragon can't approach Ten Thousand Peaks Forest anymore. If we act alone, relying on our cultivation level and combat power, we probably can't infiltrate deep into Ten Thousand Peaks Forest. After all, with war about to break out, Ten Thousand Peaks Forest is now heavily guarded. Outsiders like us would be very conspicuous."<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo just laughed: "Don't worry, Boss, I've already thought of a way."</div>
