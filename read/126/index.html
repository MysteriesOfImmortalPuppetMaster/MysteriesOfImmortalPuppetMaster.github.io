Inside the room.<br/>
<br/>
After finally calming down the two-year-old Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong felt utterly exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Taking advantage of Ning Zhuo leaving the room, he rolled his Adam's apple and spat out the potion he had just drunk, placing it into his storage pouch.<br/>
<br/>
He tasted the potion with the tip of his tongue, discerning some of the medicinal ingredients within.<br/>
<br/>
"Twenty-year-old ginseng, angelica, donkey-hide gelatin, astragalus, white wood... indeed, all are blood and qi tonics."<br/>
<br/>
However, Sun Lingtong still collected it with his storage pouch without drinking it.<br/>
<br/>
He knew his alchemy skills weren't good enough and understood that sometimes a great tonic could be a great poison.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, mixing medicinal ingredients could create a toxic concoction.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, having joined the unorthodox Void Sect, had followed his master across the land, gaining far more worldly experience than his appearance suggested.<br/>
<br/>
"Something's strange..."<br/>
<br/>
"Why is this Ning Zhuo, only two years old, so clever?" He couldn't help but think of himself.<br/>
<br/>
Though he appeared three years old, he was actually thirteen.<br/>
<br/>
"When I was severely injured, covered in blood with ghastly wounds, he saved me and brought me home. Was he not afraid of trouble? And how is he so skilled at brewing medicine?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suspected this might be a trap.<br/>
<br/>
But then he thought, "I'm just at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement, what could I possibly plot?"<br/>
<br/>
"Although I come from the Void Sect, I practice the Child Technique, not the orthodox methods of the Void Sect. What could I possibly scheme?"<br/>
<br/>
Lacking sufficient information to make an accurate judgment, Sun Lingtong decided to observe first.<br/>
<br/>
After a few days of recuperation, his magical power had returned to its peak, and he gradually saw Ning Zhuo's genuine intentions.<br/>
<br/>
One day, as Sun Lingtong lay on the bed, his ears twitched slightly, revealing a hint of surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, Ning Zhuo pushed the door open, running in breathlessly and hurriedly said, "Someone from my family is here! Quickly, little brother, let me help you to my mother's bedroom. There's an underground chamber there where you can hide."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had anticipated this and smiled slightly, "Don't worry, I have a way. Watch!" Saying this, he vanished from the bed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was stunned, quickly running to the bed, touching the now empty bedding, and looked around in shock.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's voice transmitted, "Go deal with your family."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo responded with an "Oh," filled with wonder, and ran to the small courtyard, where he saw Wang Lan.<br/>
<br/>
"Auntie," the two-year-old Ning Zhuo greeted proactively.<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan forced a smile, nodded, and then waved her hand, letting a few servants behind her enter the house.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, I'm here to help you move some things."<br/>
<br/>
"You can't live here alone. You need to move to your uncle's house," Wang Lan declared.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out a surprised sound, his face full of astonishment.<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan, having finished her inspection, ignored him and began directing people around the house. <br/>
<br/>
"Move these tables and chairs, take them back." "Hmm, this vase is nice, take it too."<br/>
<br/>
"This talisman crafting table is quite valuable. Be careful when moving it, don't damage the array patterns on the surface."<br/>
<br/>
Very quickly, Wang Lan had almost emptied Ning Zhuo's home.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving, she said to Ning Zhuo, "We'll keep these things safe for you for now." "You're just a child, it's too easy for things to get stolen."<br/>
<br/>
"When the matters at the Ancestral Hall are settled, we'll bring you over to live with us." Ning Zhuo's eyes widened, and he shook his head repeatedly, anxious, "I-I don't want to move! Mother lives here..."<br/>
<br/>
"But your mother is already dead!" Wang Lan immediately shook her head, firmly refusing, "This is not up for discussion. You're too young to protect yourself."<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan walked up to Ning Zhuo, pulled him to a corner, bent down, and stared into his face, lowering her voice, "By the way, Little Zhuo, did your mother give you anything special to keep before she passed away?"<br/>
<br/>
"These things might be very important. You're just a child, if you lose them, it would be a big problem."<br/>
<br/>
"Be good, take them out and let your aunt keep them safe for you. When you grow up and the time is right, I'll return them to you." Ning Zhuo quickly shook his head, vehemently denying, "No, there's nothing."<br/>
<br/>
"Really nothing?" Wang Lan was suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued shaking his head, "Really nothing!"<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, alright." Seeing the household servants busy moving items, Wang Lan didn't press further and temporarily let Ning Zhuo off. "Once the Ancestral Hall finishes updating your household registration, we'll come to take you over."<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving, Wang Lan lowered her voice and whispered in Ning Zhuo's ear, "Little Zhuo, if you're scared and want to move over sooner, that's fine too!"<br/>
<br/>
"Remember to keep whatever your mother gave you safe, carry it with you, don't leave it here for someone to steal!" Ning Zhuo replied, "Aunt, don't worry, I have Da Jiang and Xiao Jiang to protect me."<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan sneered, "Those two mechanical puppets only have the combat power of mid-stage Qi Refinement. They can guard the house, but they still consume spirit stones."<br/>
<br/>
After the group left, Ning Zhuo stood dazed in the main hall.<br/>
<br/>
Many pieces of furniture and items had been taken away.<br/>
<br/>
He, a two-year-old child, seemed so small in the now empty house.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong witnessed the entire process.<br/>
<br/>
Watching Ning Zhuo, he couldn't help but feel a ripple in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, he realized the reason he had been saved. "He saw that I was also a child, so he came to rescue me."<br/>
<br/>
"He treated my wounds and prepared medicine for me because he had done the same for his mother. To him, it was a very familiar task." "He must have seen himself in me." "The same loneliness and helplessness, so he naturally felt close."<br/>
<br/>
"His mother had just passed away less than half a month ago. In this suddenly larger, colder, and unfamiliar world, he just wanted to find a companion, a support." Thinking of this, Sun Lingtong deliberately circled behind Ning Zhuo and gently patted his shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was startled.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong revealed himself: "Hehe, don't be afraid, it's me!"<br/>
<br/>
The disappointment on Ning Zhuo's face disappeared, replaced by surprise and anticipation: "Little brother, are you a cultivator?" "You're so young, yet so powerful!" "Did you just use an invisibility technique?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong proudly raised his head: "This is not an ordinary invisibility technique. Wait, don't call me little brother, I'm much taller and older than you." "You should call me big brother!"<br/>
<br/>
Only at this moment did Sun Lingtong truly reveal his identity to Ning Zhuo and began to correct Ning Zhuo's address.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo retorted: "But my mother told me that some children just have big bones and aren't necessarily older than me. In our family, there's one..." Sun Lingtong waved his hand: "Alright, alright. From now on, just call me big brother." "By the way, were you pretending to be dumb just now?"<br/>
<br/>
"Your mother must have given you something very important before she passed away!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out a sound, his gaze shifting to the wall, not daring to look at Sun Lingtong: "I don't know what you're talking about!" Sun Lingtong chuckled: "I'm just telling you, your act is not convincing at all." "Next time, when your aunt asks you, just say you don't know, don't outright deny it." "The more you deny it, the more it shows that your mother gave you something."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out another sound, unable to resist asking: "Why?" Sun Lingtong's gaze seemed to penetrate his heart: "You have talent, don't you?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out another sound, his face showing a panicked expression, unable to stop himself from taking a step back, shaking his head repeatedly: "No, no. Absolutely not!" "I don't understand what you're saying at all." "I don't know, I really don't know!"<br/>
<br/>
He vehemently denied it, but his flushed face and the guilty, panicked expression on his face said it all.<br/>
<br/>
This amused Sun Lingtong, who laughed heartily and patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder: "Little brother, you may have talent and a wisdom beyond your years." "But you're still too green!" "Really obvious."<br/>
<br/>
"However, you're lucky to have met me!"<br/>
<br/>
“No one understands better than I do how to play the role of a normal child.” “Let me teach you how to disguise yourself as a two-year-old!” Sun Lingtong's words were not mere boasting.<br/>
<br/>
Though he appeared to be just a three-year-old child, his soul was already that of a thirteen-year-old youth.<br/>
<br/>
He had joined the Void Sect, where he was specially trained in various skills of deception and trickery.<br/>
<br/>
His master had adopted him from a young age, imparting knowledge and taking him on travels, teaching him to observe others and navigate the jianghu.<br/>
<br/>
Often, Sun Lingtong would play roles based on his appearance, fully utilizing his youthful looks to deceive others.<br/>
<br/>
Under his guidance, the two-year-old Ning Zhuo made rapid progress.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, what kind of talent do you have? This level of intelligence is unusual. Didn’t your mother tell you?” Sun Lingtong asked curiously.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo glanced aside before quickly looking back at Sun Lingtong, his expression natural: “Brother Sun, my mother never told me.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong chuckled, giving a thumbs-up: “Not bad, you’ve improved a lot in lying since before. But there’s still that little habit of shifting your gaze. Remember, you need to correct that!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt a bit ashamed: “Brother Sun, aren’t you mad that I kept this from you?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shrugged indifferently: “What does it matter? Everyone should have their own secrets and should also allow others to have theirs. I’m just thinking, perhaps you should reveal your talent to your family? It could greatly improve your living conditions.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly shook his head, his expression serious: “My mother told me before she left, she said I should hide my talents and keep a low profile. She said the family is unreliable, and even my uncle is unreliable. The deeper I hide, the better I can protect myself!”<br/>
<br/>
“Mm, your mother must have had your best interests at heart,” Sun Lingtong responded perfunctorily.<br/>
<br/>
He had been staying with Ning Zhuo for more than half a month, and his injuries had long since healed.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Ning Zhuo could convincingly disguise himself as a normal two-year-old child, Sun Lingtong’s desire to leave grew stronger.<br/>
<br/>
But how should he arrange for Ning Zhuo?<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Wang Lan had said she would take Ning Zhuo to live with her, but she never did.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, she sent family servants every one or two days to look after him and deliver daily necessities.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had been sneaking into the Ning family estate night after night.<br/>
<br/>
Although he was only at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement, the excellent techniques of the Void Sect allowed him to infiltrate smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
He gradually figured out the Ning family’s situation, learning about the main branch’s suppression of the side branches and gathering information about Ning Xiaoren’s reputation.<br/>
<br/>
One day, he overheard a conversation between Ning Ze and Wang Lan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze urged Wang Lan to bring Ning Zhuo over to live with them.<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan said, “Dear, the people from the ancestral hall are deliberately making things difficult, demanding a bribe of two hundred spirit stones! Do we have to pay two hundred spirit stones just to take in another child? What kind of logic is that!?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze stroked his beard and said, “The family has its rules. It must go through the elders of the ancestral hall for review, to ensure we have no ulterior motives in adopting a close relative’s orphan. Only after this approval can we officially adopt him.”<br/>
<br/>
"Before this system was implemented, it was indeed chaotic, and many tragic incidents occurred among mortals."<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo has been living alone for so many days; this is not right. If this gets out, how can I, his uncle, maintain my reputation?" Wang Lan lamented, "But two hundred spirit stones is not a small amount!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze sighed, "Alas, my brother once saved the young clan leader's life. I will go tomorrow to request an audience with the young clan leader and ask him to intervene." Sun Lingtong then went to the ancestral hall of the Ning Clan to find the elder who was holding up Ning Zhuo's household registration.<br/>
<br/>
One night, he overheard the elder having a secret conversation with a visitor.<br/>
<br/>
The visitor said, "The deed to Ning Zhong's house has not yet been found by Ning Ze. I offer four hundred spirit stones, here is a deposit of one hundred and eighty spirit stones, I hope the elder can accommodate."<br/>
<br/>
The Ning Clan elder laughed, "No problem. That Ning Gui does not understand the rules, refusing to pay even two hundred spirit stones, he deserves to suffer a bit. Just make sure not to cause a commotion."<br/>
<br/>
"After all, Ning Zhong sacrificed his life to save the young clan leader."<br/>
<br/>
The visitor said, "Rest assured, elder. Ning Zhong and his wife are both deceased, leaving behind only a two-year-old child. A little coaxing, and we can get him to sign the contract. This matter is as easy as turning over one's hand!"<br/>
<br/>
Hearing this, Sun Lingtong couldn't help but roll his eyes, feeling disdain for the Ning Clan in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to Ning Zhuo's residence, he saw that little Ning Zhuo was sleeping soundly.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong watched for a while, thinking, "This little guy is smart and knows how to disguise himself, but he has only scratched the surface. He lacks experience, does not understand the dangers of the world, and has no real support. It would be easy for those around him to devour him completely." Sun Lingtong shook his head in secret, feeling that he couldn't just leave.<br/>
<br/>
"I must teach him to see through the deceitful hearts of people."<br/>
<br/>
At Sun Lingtong's residence.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming and the other two were quickly repairing the small courtyard, removing all traces of the recent fierce battle.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the main house.<br/>
<br/>
The Soul Judge's eyes shone with divine light, enveloping Sun Lingtong's soul.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's soul had its eyes tightly shut, his face contorted in pain, his body trembling, yet he did not let out a single cry of pain.<br/>
<br/>
"A tough one!" The Blind Judge Cheng Bai sincerely praised upon seeing this.<br/>
<br/>
He muttered a few words, casting a spell to check the results of the soul search.<br/>
<br/>
A blank slate!<br/>
<br/>
"Hmm?" Cheng Bai was surprised, "The Void Imprint?" He recognized this information.<br/>
<br/>
The Void Imprint, one of the Void Sect's treasured artifacts, could imprint the heart and provide protection for its members.<br/>
<br/>
The Void Imprint could prevent soul searches, ensuring that the sect's secrets and scriptures would not be leaked if a disciple fell into enemy hands.<br/>
<br/>
"Void Emptiness Seal often protects the sect's secrets. This time, I was merely gathering information about Chui Can Ke, yet I was implicated as well?"<br/>
<br/>
"Isn't this Sun Lingtong an outer disciple? How could the Void Emptiness Seal guard so meticulously?"<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Han Ming entered the room. "Lord Cheng, have you found any information about Chui Can Ke?"<br/>
<br/>
"Running into me, the Blind Judge, is his misfortune!"<br/>
<br/>
Qi Bai snorted coldly. "This matter is a bit troublesome. No wonder Sun Lingtong was so fearless before, unafraid of soul-searching. However, if it were an ordinary fellow disciple, they would be helpless against this."<br/>
<br/>
"Give me one more day, and I'll have your answer."<br/>
<br/>
Xi Bai waved his hand, his expression displeased.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming quickly lowered her head, sensibly exited the room, and respectfully closed the door behind her.</div>
