<paragraph index="1">Inside the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After finally calming down the two-year-old Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong felt utterly exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Taking advantage of Ning Zhuo leaving the room, he rolled his Adam's apple and spat out the potion he had just drunk, placing it into his storage pouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He tasted the potion with the tip of his tongue, discerning some of the medicinal ingredients within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Twenty-year-old ginseng, angelica, donkey-hide gelatin, astragalus, white wood... indeed, all are blood and qi tonics."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">However, Sun Lingtong still collected it with his storage pouch without drinking it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He knew his alchemy skills weren't good enough and understood that sometimes a great tonic could be a great poison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sometimes, mixing medicinal ingredients could create a toxic concoction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lingtong, having joined the unorthodox Void Sect, had followed his master across the land, gaining far more worldly experience than his appearance suggested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Something's strange..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Why is this Ning Zhuo, only two years old, so clever?" He couldn't help but think of himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Though he appeared three years old, he was actually thirteen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"When I was severely injured, covered in blood with ghastly wounds, he saved me and brought me home. Was he not afraid of trouble? And how is he so skilled at brewing medicine?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sun Lingtong suspected this might be a trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">But then he thought, "I'm just at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement, what could I possibly plot?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Although I come from the Void Sect, I practice the Child Technique, not the orthodox methods of the Void Sect. What could I possibly scheme?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Lacking sufficient information to make an accurate judgment, Sun Lingtong decided to observe first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After a few days of recuperation, his magical power had returned to its peak, and he gradually saw Ning Zhuo's genuine intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">One day, as Sun Lingtong lay on the bed, his ears twitched slightly, revealing a hint of surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Soon, Ning Zhuo pushed the door open, running in breathlessly and hurriedly said, "Someone from my family is here! Quickly, little brother, let me help you to my mother's bedroom. There's an underground chamber there where you can hide."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sun Lingtong had anticipated this and smiled slightly, "Don't worry, I have a way. Watch!" Saying this, he vanished from the bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo was stunned, quickly running to the bed, touching the now empty bedding, and looked around in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Sun Lingtong's voice transmitted, "Go deal with your family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo responded with an "Oh," filled with wonder, and ran to the small courtyard, where he saw Wang Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Auntie," the two-year-old Ning Zhuo greeted proactively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Wang Lan forced a smile, nodded, and then waved her hand, letting a few servants behind her enter the house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Little Zhuo, I'm here to help you move some things."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"You can't live here alone. You need to move to your uncle's house," Wang Lan declared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo let out a surprised sound, his face full of astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Wang Lan, having finished her inspection, ignored him and began directing people around the house. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Move these tables and chairs, take them back." "Hmm, this vase is nice, take it too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"This talisman crafting table is quite valuable. Be careful when moving it, don't damage the array patterns on the surface."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Very quickly, Wang Lan had almost emptied Ning Zhuo's home.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Before leaving, she said to Ning Zhuo, "We'll keep these things safe for you for now." "You're just a child, it's too easy for things to get stolen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"When the matters at the Ancestral Hall are settled, we'll bring you over to live with us." Ning Zhuo's eyes widened, and he shook his head repeatedly, anxious, "I-I don't want to move! Mother lives here..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"But your mother is already dead!" Wang Lan immediately shook her head, firmly refusing, "This is not up for discussion. You're too young to protect yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Wang Lan walked up to Ning Zhuo, pulled him to a corner, bent down, and stared into his face, lowering her voice, "By the way, Little Zhuo, did your mother give you anything special to keep before she passed away?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"These things might be very important. You're just a child, if you lose them, it would be a big problem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Be good, take them out and let your aunt keep them safe for you. When you grow up and the time is right, I'll return them to you." Ning Zhuo quickly shook his head, vehemently denying, "No, there's nothing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Really nothing?" Wang Lan was suspicious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo continued shaking his head, "Really nothing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Alright, alright." Seeing the household servants busy moving items, Wang Lan didn't press further and temporarily let Ning Zhuo off. "Once the Ancestral Hall finishes updating your household registration, we'll come to take you over."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Before leaving, Wang Lan lowered her voice and whispered in Ning Zhuo's ear, "Little Zhuo, if you're scared and want to move over sooner, that's fine too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Remember to keep whatever your mother gave you safe, carry it with you, don't leave it here for someone to steal!" Ning Zhuo replied, "Aunt, don't worry, I have Da Jiang and Xiao Jiang to protect me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Wang Lan sneered, "Those two mechanical puppets only have the combat power of mid-stage Qi Refinement. They can guard the house, but they still consume spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">After the group left, Ning Zhuo stood dazed in the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Many pieces of furniture and items had been taken away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He, a two-year-old child, seemed so small in the now empty house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Sun Lingtong witnessed the entire process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Watching Ning Zhuo, he couldn't help but feel a ripple in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">At this moment, he realized the reason he had been saved. "He saw that I was also a child, so he came to rescue me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"He treated my wounds and prepared medicine for me because he had done the same for his mother. To him, it was a very familiar task." "He must have seen himself in me." "The same loneliness and helplessness, so he naturally felt close."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"His mother had just passed away less than half a month ago. In this suddenly larger, colder, and unfamiliar world, he just wanted to find a companion, a support." Thinking of this, Sun Lingtong deliberately circled behind Ning Zhuo and gently patted his shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo was startled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong revealed himself: "Hehe, don't be afraid, it's me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The disappointment on Ning Zhuo's face disappeared, replaced by surprise and anticipation: "Little brother, are you a cultivator?" "You're so young, yet so powerful!" "Did you just use an invisibility technique?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong proudly raised his head: "This is not an ordinary invisibility technique. Wait, don't call me little brother, I'm much taller and older than you." "You should call me big brother!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Only at this moment did Sun Lingtong truly reveal his identity to Ning Zhuo and began to correct Ning Zhuo's address.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo retorted: "But my mother told me that some children just have big bones and aren't necessarily older than me. In our family, there's one..." Sun Lingtong waved his hand: "Alright, alright. From now on, just call me big brother." "By the way, were you pretending to be dumb just now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Your mother must have given you something very important before she passed away!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo let out a sound, his gaze shifting to the wall, not daring to look at Sun Lingtong: "I don't know what you're talking about!" Sun Lingtong chuckled: "I'm just telling you, your act is not convincing at all." "Next time, when your aunt asks you, just say you don't know, don't outright deny it." "The more you deny it, the more it shows that your mother gave you something."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo let out another sound, unable to resist asking: "Why?" Sun Lingtong's gaze seemed to penetrate his heart: "You have talent, don't you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo let out another sound, his face showing a panicked expression, unable to stop himself from taking a step back, shaking his head repeatedly: "No, no. Absolutely not!" "I don't understand what you're saying at all." "I don't know, I really don't know!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He vehemently denied it, but his flushed face and the guilty, panicked expression on his face said it all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This amused Sun Lingtong, who laughed heartily and patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder: "Little brother, you may have talent and a wisdom beyond your years." "But you're still too green!" "Really obvious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"However, you're lucky to have met me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“No one understands better than I do how to play the role of a normal child.” “Let me teach you how to disguise yourself as a two-year-old!” Sun Lingtong's words were not mere boasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Though he appeared to be just a three-year-old child, his soul was already that of a thirteen-year-old youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He had joined the Void Sect, where he was specially trained in various skills of deception and trickery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">His master had adopted him from a young age, imparting knowledge and taking him on travels, teaching him to observe others and navigate the jianghu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Often, Sun Lingtong would play roles based on his appearance, fully utilizing his youthful looks to deceive others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Under his guidance, the two-year-old Ning Zhuo made rapid progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“Hey, what kind of talent do you have? This level of intelligence is unusual. Didn’t your mother tell you?” Sun Lingtong asked curiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo glanced aside before quickly looking back at Sun Lingtong, his expression natural: “Brother Sun, my mother never told me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong chuckled, giving a thumbs-up: “Not bad, you’ve improved a lot in lying since before. But there’s still that little habit of shifting your gaze. Remember, you need to correct that!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo felt a bit ashamed: “Brother Sun, aren’t you mad that I kept this from you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong shrugged indifferently: “What does it matter? Everyone should have their own secrets and should also allow others to have theirs. I’m just thinking, perhaps you should reveal your talent to your family? It could greatly improve your living conditions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo quickly shook his head, his expression serious: “My mother told me before she left, she said I should hide my talents and keep a low profile. She said the family is unreliable, and even my uncle is unreliable. The deeper I hide, the better I can protect myself!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“Mm, your mother must have had your best interests at heart,” Sun Lingtong responded perfunctorily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He had been staying with Ning Zhuo for more than half a month, and his injuries had long since healed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Now that Ning Zhuo could convincingly disguise himself as a normal two-year-old child, Sun Lingtong’s desire to leave grew stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">But how should he arrange for Ning Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Previously, Wang Lan had said she would take Ning Zhuo to live with her, but she never did.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Instead, she sent family servants every one or two days to look after him and deliver daily necessities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong had been sneaking into the Ning family estate night after night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Although he was only at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement, the excellent techniques of the Void Sect allowed him to infiltrate smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He gradually figured out the Ning family’s situation, learning about the main branch’s suppression of the side branches and gathering information about Ning Xiaoren’s reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">One day, he overheard a conversation between Ning Ze and Wang Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Ze urged Wang Lan to bring Ning Zhuo over to live with them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Wang Lan said, “Dear, the people from the ancestral hall are deliberately making things difficult, demanding a bribe of two hundred spirit stones! Do we have to pay two hundred spirit stones just to take in another child? What kind of logic is that!?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Ze stroked his beard and said, “The family has its rules. It must go through the elders of the ancestral hall for review, to ensure we have no ulterior motives in adopting a close relative’s orphan. Only after this approval can we officially adopt him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Before this system was implemented, it was indeed chaotic, and many tragic incidents occurred among mortals."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Little Zhuo has been living alone for so many days; this is not right. If this gets out, how can I, his uncle, maintain my reputation?" Wang Lan lamented, "But two hundred spirit stones is not a small amount!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Ze sighed, "Alas, my brother once saved the young clan leader's life. I will go tomorrow to request an audience with the young clan leader and ask him to intervene." Sun Lingtong then went to the ancestral hall of the Ning Clan to find the elder who was holding up Ning Zhuo's household registration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">One night, he overheard the elder having a secret conversation with a visitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The visitor said, "The deed to Ning Zhong's house has not yet been found by Ning Ze. I offer four hundred spirit stones, here is a deposit of one hundred and eighty spirit stones, I hope the elder can accommodate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Ning Clan elder laughed, "No problem. That Ning Gui does not understand the rules, refusing to pay even two hundred spirit stones, he deserves to suffer a bit. Just make sure not to cause a commotion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"After all, Ning Zhong sacrificed his life to save the young clan leader."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The visitor said, "Rest assured, elder. Ning Zhong and his wife are both deceased, leaving behind only a two-year-old child. A little coaxing, and we can get him to sign the contract. This matter is as easy as turning over one's hand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Hearing this, Sun Lingtong couldn't help but roll his eyes, feeling disdain for the Ning Clan in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Returning to Ning Zhuo's residence, he saw that little Ning Zhuo was sleeping soundly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Sun Lingtong watched for a while, thinking, "This little guy is smart and knows how to disguise himself, but he has only scratched the surface. He lacks experience, does not understand the dangers of the world, and has no real support. It would be easy for those around him to devour him completely." Sun Lingtong shook his head in secret, feeling that he couldn't just leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"I must teach him to see through the deceitful hearts of people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">At Sun Lingtong's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Han Ming and the other two were quickly repairing the small courtyard, removing all traces of the recent fierce battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Inside the main house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The Soul Judge's eyes shone with divine light, enveloping Sun Lingtong's soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Sun Lingtong's soul had its eyes tightly shut, his face contorted in pain, his body trembling, yet he did not let out a single cry of pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"A tough one!" The Blind Judge Cheng Bai sincerely praised upon seeing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He muttered a few words, casting a spell to check the results of the soul search.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">A blank slate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Hmm?" Cheng Bai was surprised, "The Void Imprint?" He recognized this information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Void Imprint, one of the Void Sect's treasured artifacts, could imprint the heart and provide protection for its members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Void Imprint could prevent soul searches, ensuring that the sect's secrets and scriptures would not be leaked if a disciple fell into enemy hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Void Emptiness Seal often protects the sect's secrets. This time, I was merely gathering information about Chui Can Ke, yet I was implicated as well?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Isn't this Sun Lingtong an outer disciple? How could the Void Emptiness Seal guard so meticulously?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">At this moment, Han Ming entered the room. "Lord Cheng, have you found any information about Chui Can Ke?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Running into me, the Blind Judge, is his misfortune!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Qi Bai snorted coldly. "This matter is a bit troublesome. No wonder Sun Lingtong was so fearless before, unafraid of soul-searching. However, if it were an ordinary fellow disciple, they would be helpless against this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Give me one more day, and I'll have your answer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Xi Bai waved his hand, his expression displeased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Han Ming quickly lowered her head, sensibly exited the room, and respectfully closed the door behind her.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
