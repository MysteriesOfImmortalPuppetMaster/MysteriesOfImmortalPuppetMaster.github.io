<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">At the summit of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Meng Kui's entire body surged with mana. At this moment, he exerted all his strength and unleashed his techniques!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He took out a treasured seal and threw it forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The magical artifact-level seal rapidly expanded in mid-air, transforming into a mountain that crashed down with a thunderous force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Treasure Seal Mountain blocked the volcano's opening, forcibly halting the eruption of lava.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In an instant, the lava flow was reduced by half, significantly alleviating the pressure on the front lines of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Meng Kui then retrieved a magical artifact-level gourd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He opened the gourd's stopper and poured out a vast river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The river water poured down like a deep cloth, flooding into the volcano's summit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Steam rose, and for a moment, the smoke spread like a sea of clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This river water was not ordinary; it was a special material Meng Kui had gathered from nature and refined multiple times, reaching the Foundation Establishment level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">After sacrificing a large amount of river water, Meng Kui successfully slowed the spread of the lava by another thirty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Once the gourd was emptied, Meng Kui put away both the gourd and the Treasure Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Treasure Seal had withstood the lava's eruption, and its surface was nearly half-damaged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Meng Kui couldn't afford to feel heartache. He spread his arms, his sleeves billowing, and performed another of his signature techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Divine Ability—Universe Within the Sleeve!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In the next moment, his two sleeves rapidly expanded, their openings as large as houses, dark and deep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">From within the sleeves, a powerful suction force erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Countless streams of lava were drawn in by this force, converging into two torrents that flowed into Meng Kui's sleeves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Meng Kui diverted the lava at its source, single-handedly suppressing thirty percent of the lava flow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Through his and the entire city's relentless efforts, the spread of the lava slowed more and more, eventually coming to a complete stop after devouring a few peripheral buildings on the city's outskirts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"We won, we won, we won!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Fire Persimmon Immortal City is saved, my home is saved!" "Hahaha..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The city was filled with cheers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">People were jubilant, shouting and celebrating with extreme excitement, but a few still wore worried expressions, their faces somber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Among them were Zhu Xuanji and Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhu Xuanji's eyes glowed with golden light as he tried to peer into the mountain's interior through its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He knew very well that the lava problem wasn't the biggest issue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The real challenge lay within Fire Persimmon Mountain. More precisely, it was the countless Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts within the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Roar, roar...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The roars gradually drowned out the city's cheers and shouts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Some people, hearing this commotion, showed puzzled expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">But more people realized what was happening, their faces turning pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"This is bad. The volcanic tremors have triggered a beast tide of unprecedented terror." "What should we do? What should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Panic spread among the crowd once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">A few breaths later, as the lava subsided, an endless horde of Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts surged out from the lava.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">They were all in a state of rage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Who wouldn't be furious if their peaceful life was suddenly turned upside down by an unexpected bombardment?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts charged towards the Lava Immortal Palace like a tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">They had pinpointed the source of the bombardment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">If one could hear their thoughts, it would undoubtedly be—revenge, revenge, revenge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Leading the charge were the Fire Snakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Fire Snakes' bodies were slender, like flowing flames, almost merging with the lava, seemingly omnipresent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Following the snake horde were the Fire Velvet Mice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">These small yet ferocious demon beasts charged towards the Lava Immortal Palace in packs, like a red river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The spherical barrier of Fire Persimmon Immortal City was being fiercely gnawed at by the mouse horde!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Among the mice, giant mice the size of elephants acted as leaders. Each of these giant mice was at the Golden Core Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Even larger were the Stomping Flame Lizards, whose bodies, at the Golden Core level, were as massive as small hills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Their limbs were thick, their skin covered in a layer of hard Scarlet Flame scales, and their tails burned with fire. Each breath they exhaled could stir up a fiery storm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Stomping Flame Lizards hissed and charged at the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">But the true kings among the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were the Fire Fusion Demon Apes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">These demon apes stood one to two zhang tall, their bodies covered in thick fur. The fur was a pure red, as if ablaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The demon apes bared their fangs, their eyes wide, each one burly and strong. Many of them beat their chests, roaring, their cries shaking the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Among all the demon beasts, the demon apes were the most intelligent, making them the most threatening beast horde.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Besides these three main forces, there were also numerous Red Rock Demons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">They emerged one after another from the lava, slowly floating in the air, surrounding the Lava Immortal Palace from above.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">These stone heads were densely packed, numbering in the thousands, an unprecedented quantity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The demon beasts knew the source of the bombardment and targeted the Lava Immortal Palace for revenge. But the beast tide was too massive, and in their rage, many lost their senses, blindly charging in all directions. A significant portion of them headed straight for Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">There was no time for words. Zhu Xuanji and the other Golden Core cultivators stood at the front lines, fighting fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">For a moment, the battlefield was in a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo's cannon shot had stirred up a hornet's nest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He had thoroughly enraged the massive Scarlet Flame Demon Beast horde within Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">At the mountain's summit, Meng Kui continued to make moves, his Nascent Soul-level spells covering the area, slaying many Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">But more demon beasts emerged endlessly from the lava, impossible to kill them all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Meng Kui cursed harshly, for he sensed a Nascent Soul-level life force among the beast horde.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">It seemed to be a Fire Snake!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">It hid within the lava, its presence flickering. And it was precisely this unsheathed blade that exerted the most psychological pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the citizens' cheers had vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">They watched in terror as the massive beast horde spread towards them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The demon beasts were so numerous, they blotted out the sky! Under such a tide, a person seemed so small and helpless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ding-character, underground secret base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Amidst the battle above ground, this underground base occasionally shook violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu were hiding inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"The volcano erupted, and the demon beasts are attacking the city!" Yang Chanyu hadn't severed her connection with the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Such a significant event, she was naturally aware of it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Sun Lingtong, what exactly is going on?" Yang Chanyu looked at Sun Lingtong, her intuition telling her that this matter seemed related to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes and spread his hands: "I don't know either, why bother with these things?" "Now the whole city is in chaos, almost everyone is doing their best to defend their homes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"This opportunity is rare! Let's think about where it's most suitable to make a move?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Yang Chanyu wasn't easily diverted, her eyes narrowing as she stared at Sun Lingtong with deep meaning: "Why do I feel like you're not surprised at all?" Sun Lingtong nodded: "Surprised, of course I'm surprised, but does it have anything to do with us?" "We're not from Fire Persimmon Immortal City, even if it gets destroyed, we can just leave." "Now is when all the major forces are at their weakest, if we're going to act, we should aim big. What do you think about those newly arrived Cloud Merchants?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Yang Chanyu remained unmoved: "Your constant topic shifting is really suspicious. Tell me, what's your relationship with Ning Zhuo?" "During the previous Golden Core melee, I didn't notice anything."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"But the more I think about it, the more something feels off. You've done so much, had me play disguises, and even create a fake Demonic Dao Scripture." "Yet after the Golden Core melee, there was no follow-up treasure theft, the melee seemed more like a show." "Where's the big operation, the grand plan you mentioned?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Why do I feel like our actions were just to clear Ning Zhuo of suspicion, to ease his pressure?" "After all, the previous rumors were quite unfavorable for him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes again: "What, you're overthinking it, aren't you?" "During the Golden Core melee, I wanted to act too, but the melee didn't fully break out." "Zheng Danlian's mechanical sickle was too fierce! Even the Golden Core true disciples of the Great Purity Palace had no power to resist." "In such a situation, how could I dare to make a big move?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong explained up to this point, then continued: "But this time, these Cloud Merchants and the three major families are different." "They're outsiders, and the magical artifacts they can carry are strictly regulated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Even if they have a Nascent Soul-level Cloud Whale, that giant creature is far outside the city, not suitable for capturing us." "I found out: this group of Cloud Merchants plans to hold an auction soon, with many high-end cultivation resources among the items." "For example, the water element treasure, Wirtuous Water, has three drops!" "Aren't you tempted by this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Yang Chanyu chuckled coldly: "Of course I've heard of this news. But those three drops of Virtuous Water, if you want to steal them for yourself, to cleanse our marriage, it's far from enough." Sun Lingtong sighed: "What are you talking about, I...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Just as he was speaking, Sun Lingtong's expression suddenly changed drastically, turning his head to look in a certain direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He shouted: "Who's there?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Yang Chanyu instantly became alert, taking out a magical artifact and holding it in her hand, but the entire underground base was empty, with no one in sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">She showed a puzzled expression and glanced at Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Sun Lingtong murmured: "Was it an illusion?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He wasn't entirely sure either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Immediately, his eyes flashed with cold light, and he said seriously: "In any case, this Ding-character underground secret base can't be used anymore, we need to move immediately!" Yang Chanyu had no objections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Before leaving, Sun Lingtong took a moment to set up many traps in the Ding-character underground secret base.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
