<paragraph index="1">When Qing Chi agreed to Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo) without hesitation, for the first time, Qing Yan felt shaken - was it really safe to hand over the army’s morale to Qing Chi so easily?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo’s scalp tingled. For a moment, he was speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Qing Chi, however, locked eyes with him and broke into a brilliant, beaming smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">A pang of guilt stirred in Ning Zhuo’s chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He had never encountered anything like this before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Back in Two Note Kingdom, even though Mu Lan had her preferences with him, everything had been calculated - about the greater good, about benefit. But the girl in front of him… she was entirely sincere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sigh. I’m using the identity of Jiao Ma to deceive her. That’s wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">But this concerns Forgetful River Prefecture Lord Meng’s century-old scheme, my mother’s dying wish, and the safety of White Paper Immortal City itself. At a time like this, I can’t expose my true identity. Qing Chi is becoming more and more vital...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly. I’ll just have to let Qing Chi down for now. When this ghost tide subsides, I’ll tell her everything and apologize properly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Compared to Mu Lan, Qing Chi was far less reliable - still too young.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After some thought, Ning Zhuo decided to keep his secret for the time being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He turned toward Li Xiangshang and Qing Yan, choosing his words carefully as he prepared to explain the reasoning behind his decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Even though Qing Chi would follow “Jiao Ma” without question, it was still critical to win over both Li Xiangshang and Qing Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Back before the events in Two Note Kingdom, Ning Zhuo might’ve thought that controlling Qing Chi meant controlling the army by extension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">But after the brutal war in Two Note, his perspective had broadened. Experience had taught him well - a general was only part of an army, however prominent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The true strength of a force came from its soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Winning over Qing Yan would mean gaining the endorsement of this army’s prototype.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Winning over Li Xiangshang meant ensuring he would continue supporting Qing Chi as she built the new army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo finally spoke. “Of the three troop types, the Paper Money Spirit Envoys are the most expensive. But you get what you pay for - there’s a reason behind the cost.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“In my view, their greatest advantage lies in their ability to traverse the realms of the living and the dead. And this ability is far more practical than it seems.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“The living and the underworld realms are separated. If the new army gets surrounded in the living world and falls into a hopeless situation, they can escape to the underworld and seize a second chance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Likewise, if they’re deep in the underworld chasing ghostly foes and need to regroup, they can shift back to the world of the living and recover at ease.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“If we go with this option, our new force will have complete mobility, full control of the battlefield.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Especially here, in the dark, damp Ghostly Black Marshlands, the boundary between the two realms is thinner than usual. This is practically home turf for the new army.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Tell me - isn’t that worth it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The others hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo’s argument was compelling, but not yet enough to convince them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Qing Yan spoke up bluntly. “That’s all still guesswork, not hard fact. If this new force can’t switch between realms quickly, then its greatest strength is basically useless.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Look at the ghost troops outside the city. They’ve come straight from the underworld, haven’t they?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“They’re not even Underworld Troopers, but they can still do that using the Underworld Flood Dragon River.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He made a valid point - but Ning Zhuo had one line that silenced him completely:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Even if the travel between realms is slow, at least with this choice, the Qing Clan’s main force won’t end up trapped and buried in White Paper Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“The ghost tide grows stronger by the day. Who’s to say this city won’t fall in the end?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“So, having a troop like this means at least the Qing Clan’s bloodline will survive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Qing Chi’s eyes lit up. “Little Ma, you really are clever to think of that!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Qing Yan frowned. “Don’t forget - Forgetful River Prefecture Lord Meng commands a vast force, on par with an entire cultivation nation. What we’ve seen here in the world of the living is only a fraction of his army. If we follow them into the underworld, we might end up facing that Nascent Soul-level lord directly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo shook his head. “Lord Meng is a ruler of an entire realm. How could we just stumble across him that easily?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“It’s only a possibility.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“But if we go with the Paper Money Spirit Envoys, at least we’ll have a fallback - a card we can play if things go south.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Qing Yan fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Li Xiangshang, however, had already been convinced. “That makes a lot of sense. I agree now - this is the right path.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Qing Yan turned to Ning Zhuo. “So, boy from the Jiao Clan, is that what this is really about? You want your clan to join this new army too, to secure your own family’s escape route?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo paused for half a second.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His real reason for selecting the Paper Money Spirit Envoys had nothing to do with the Jiao Clan’s survival. He needed this force to enter the underworld at a critical moment, to reach the sacrificial altar, to help him fulfill his mother’s dying wish - and to shatter Lord Meng’s century-long scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But he couldn’t say that aloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Not even White Paper City Lord knew the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">And Qing Yan’s assumption made for a perfectly reasonable cover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">So Ning Zhuo nodded, playing along. “That’s right. This ghost tide is unlike any before. The underworld armies keep growing in number. We need to consider our families, our friends. We have to prepare.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Qing Yan nodded. “If the Jiao Clan joins and supports Qing Chi as general, then I agree.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“With a way to save our own lives, none of us will be forced to perish with White Paper Immortal City. That means we definitely won’t be able to count on funding from the City Lord.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“That’s our biggest problem now - where are we supposed to get the money and resources?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly and pulled out a storage pouch, handing it to Qing Yan. “Please take a look, Lord Qing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Qing Yan took the pouch, opened it, and sent his spiritual sense inside. His expression instantly changed to one of shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">There was an enormous trove of resources inside!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">And no wonder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This was nearly the entire fortune of the renowned expert, the Heavenly Ghost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Li Xiangshang and Qing Chi also peeked inside, their faces lighting up with delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">But Qing Yan frowned. “There’s a lot here, but most of it isn’t suitable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">To forge Paper Money Spirit Envoys, they needed a hundred thousand catties of century-old green sandalwood pulp, mixed with cinnabar from Chenzhou to craft azure-violet talismans. While burning those talismans, nine hundred catties of deep-sea agarwood from the Southern Sea had to be incinerated simultaneously to temper the divine sea. Finally, immense quantities of yin qi were needed to saturate and infuse the body - for twenty-seven days straight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo had expected this objection and answered at once. “Even if the City Lord were supporting us, she wouldn’t have handed over exactly the right materials from the start.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“We can just trade with other factions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“White Paper Immortal City isn’t only made up of the City Lord’s forces - there’s the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Soul Devouring Sect, and other super sects as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Qing Chi nodded eagerly. “Right, exactly! We can talk to them!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“These past days, the ghost tide’s been growing stronger and stronger. A lot of cultivators in the city have died. And with no end in sight, the City Lord’s already sent out a call for aid.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“The Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Soul Devouring Sect - they’ll be sending reinforcements soon.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“White Paper Immortal City is the only hegemon of the Ghostly Black Marshlands. It controls all the cultivation resources here. Those great sects have been waiting for a chance to get involved for ages.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“But still…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Little Ma, how are you this rich? Did you pour in your clan’s entire foundation? Did your father give you his backing?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo coughed lightly. “Well, on one hand, I did earn my father’s approval. On the other… I received support from another faction. As for which one, I’d rather not say.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Qing Yan looked down at the storage pouch in his hand and chuckled softly. “The Soul Devouring Sect, isn’t it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo’s expression shifted slightly. He gave a wry smile and nodded. “I knew I couldn’t fool you, Commander Qing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">There was no way to hide the traces of the Soul Devouring Sect in the Ghost of Heaven’s fortune. Ning Zhuo had anticipated this line of questioning and prepared his answer in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">By deliberately keeping things vague and letting Qing Yan “guess” the truth, he made the claim feel more credible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Li Xiangshang also looked as though something had just clicked for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“On the surface, it looks like White Paper Immortal City is resisting Forgetful River Prefecture and the ghost tide. But the situation is more complicated than that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“The Soul Devouring Sect is one of the great sects, and they’re hungry for the cultivation resources in this region.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“But within White Paper City, the dominant powers are the City Lord’s faction and the Myriad Manifestations Sect. The Soul Devouring Sect couldn’t compete with either - despite repeated attempts. Now, it seems they’ve pinned their hopes on this new army.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“They really live up to their name as a super sect. Not only have they already uncovered intelligence on this development, they even understood the sway you, Jiao Ma, have over Qing Chi. They’re using you to push their plans forward. Very clever.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Before coming to the Ghostly Black Marshlands, Ning Zhuo had been highly cautious of the Soul Devouring Sect. He never imagined that, at this moment, he would be using their name to achieve his goals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“Since the Jiao Clan is joining, I’ll need to serve as Deputy Commander of the new army,” Ning Zhuo said, striking while the iron was hot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Qing Yan frowned in thought, but Qing Chi immediately nodded, elated. “Little Ma, if you’re going to fight by my side, that’s wonderful! I welcome you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Qing Yan gave a long sigh and eventually nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo continued, “We’ll also need to notify White Paper Immortal City. We may not need their funding, but if we succeed in building this army, it’ll strengthen the city’s defenses against the ghost tide.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“There’s room for cooperation here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“And even if this new force sparks the City Lord’s suspicion, given her current condition, she’ll have little choice but to tolerate it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Qing Chi was beaming. “Little Ma, I knew you wouldn’t fall for some old woman!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">But both Li Xiangshang and Qing Yan looked uneasy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Qing Yan said, “This needs to be reported properly. I’m genuinely worried about the City Lord’s reaction.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Li Xiangshang nodded. “He’s right. There’s a real chance she’ll reject it outright. In White Paper Immortal City, the City Lord’s word is law. Not even the Myriad Manifestations Sect can shake her control.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Before I arrived, Lord Dragon Sovereign warned me: the City Lord of White Paper is an ambitious cultivator with a powerful need for control. He told me to be extremely cautious.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo gave a slight nod. “The City Lord already knows we’re raising an army. Given the looming threat, she’s more likely to rein it in than to crush it outright. Either way, we’ve made our decision. It’s time to report this. It’s in the interest of the greater good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The others nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Through this negotiation, Ning Zhuo had sacrificed the bulk of his resources to secure deep involvement in the new army and move one step closer to his true objective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Back inside the Paper Giant, Ning Zhuo used the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern to report the progress to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Sun Lingtong sighed. “Little Zhuo, you really went all in this time. We basically poured all our wartime profits into building this army. And even then, it’s still not enough.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo said, “So, boss, think you can get some funding from Luo Si?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">In truth, Ning Zhuo hadn’t received any real backing from the Soul Devouring Sect. The costs of forming an army were massive - even after pouring in nearly all his resources, there was still a gap to fill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Sun Lingtong sighed. “I’ll give it a try.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">After a long journey, he had tracked down Luo Si’s whereabouts. As a commanding general, Luo Si’s location wasn’t hard to find with the right inquiries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo nodded. “I’ll also take this chance to send a flying message to the City Lord’s avatar, see if we can get any support from her side.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Sun Lingtong laughed. “Well, that depends on how much weight your ‘savior’ title still carries in the City Lord’s eyes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Over the next two days, good news arrived one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Sun Lingtong managed to meet Luo Si in person. Claiming that they had already met with Ash Bone Elder - and that they were seeking help under his guidance - he made his pitch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ash Bone Elder was now under a sort of indirect house arrest, and contacting him had become much more difficult. Luo Si hesitated for a moment, knowing any message would be delayed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">But Sun Lingtong pressed that he was in a hurry to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Luo Si had formed a good impression of Sun Lingtong from their first meeting at the banks of the Forgotten River. After considering briefly, he decided not to wait for a reply. He directly handed over a generous amount of resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">At Sun Lingtong’s request, Luo Si also issued a new writ of passage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">With this document, Sun Lingtong could openly lead the ox-riders along the Underworld’s military road beside the Underworld Flood Dragon River and return to the living realm without issue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The second piece of good news came from White Paper Immortal City: not only had the City Lord approved the establishment of the new army, she had gone above and beyond Ning Zhuo’s request - offering triple the amount of resources he had initially asked for.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">With that, even accounting for Li Xiangshang’s threefold reduction in potential due to his injuries, Ning Zhuo had successfully gathered all the funds needed to initiate the army’s cultivation program.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">In addition, the City Lord opened up a secret cultivation chamber - a room inscribed with time-acceleration arrays.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“So this is what it means to be blessed by destiny?” Both Sun and Ning had met Ash Bone Elder and knew the inside story. They marveled at the strange workings of fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“I think I’m beginning to understand the Elder’s path,” Ning Zhuo said. “If you align yourself with heaven’s will and the flow of the land, things that should be difficult often unfold with ease. Obstacles just melt away.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Sun Lingtong, on the other hand, was thinking more mischievously. “So… how do you steal fate? If I could get my hands on a chunk of that, how great would that be?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">With the cultivation program settled, Ning Zhuo reached out to the Jiao Clan again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“What? Forming a new army?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“What? You’re already at the cultivation stage?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“What? Paper Money Spirit Envoys?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Jiao Ma’s father was stunned three times in a row. But under Ning Zhuo’s persuasion, he nodded decisively. “You’re right. The clan needs a backup plan. I’ll head back and handpick an elite squad to serve under you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">“You’ve done well, Ma’er. You’ve brought honor to your father!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Before leaving, he gave Ning Zhuo a firm pat on the shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">That simple gesture made Ning Zhuo’s heart tremble slightly. For a moment, he thought, “If my real father were still alive, would he have patted my shoulder like that and encouraged me too?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The lack of a father’s presence in childhood - such a wound could linger for a lifetime.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
