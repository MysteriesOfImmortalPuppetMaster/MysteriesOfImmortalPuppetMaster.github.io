<paragraph index="1">Yang Sanyan and Wen Ruanyu were taken aback when Zheng Shoumo abruptly confessed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Earlier, Zheng Shoumo had vehemently argued with Ning Zhuo, only to suddenly surrender.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"What's going on here?" they wondered, their minds swirling with suspicion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">They turned to Ning Zhuo, expecting an explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "In that case, Old Zheng, you might as well surrender. After all, you've contributed greatly to the education of White Paper Immortal City. You might be granted leniency."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zheng Shoumo sneered. "Boy, you may lack concrete evidence, but you're not without your tricks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Capturing me alive won't be easy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Before he could finish, a surge of energy erupted from his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Dao Field - Dragon Pool Hidden Scales!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In the next instant, the two Dao Fields merged, rapidly transforming the surrounding environment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The once lush grassland, where grass grew waist-high, now became a marshy wetland dotted with scattered boulders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Several streams began to flow, their waters murmuring softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Wen Ruanyu drew his brush and began writing in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Yang Sanyan summoned his flying knives, which sliced through the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The characters and the flying daggers arrived at Zheng Shoumo's eyes almost simultaneously from opposite directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This was clearly Wen Ruanyu and Yang Sanyan's intention. Though fighting together for the first time, their high combat proficiency allowed them to coordinate their attacks seamlessly, launching a synchronized assault on Zheng Shoumo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zheng Shoumo didn't dodge, remaining rooted to the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In the next instant, a torrent of water erupted, swirling around him to form an impenetrable barrier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The characters splashed against the translucent water, sending droplets flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The more potent flying dagger Magic Artifacts were swallowed whole, leaving only faint ripples in their wake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Wen Ruanyu and Yang Sanyan's expressions turned grave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo called out a timely warning: "Careful! That's Overturned Water!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Water-element Sinister Treasure - Overturned Water! It severed all connections to whatever it enveloped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">As the saying goes, "Spilled water cannot be recovered!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Wen Ruanyu suddenly understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Yang Sanyan glanced at Ning Zhuo, finally grasping why Zheng Shoumo had abruptly lost his resolve at the last moment, abandoning his defense and openly admitting to being an Internal Traitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The key reason lay in the Overturned Water itself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Storing such a Five Elements treasure was no easy task, and maintaining it came at a considerable cost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Storing Water Element treasures, whether virtuous or sinful, generally followed the same principle: water flows downward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Storing pure Overturned Water was particularly expensive. The slightest negligence could cause it to dilute on its own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">For daily storage, cultivators typically diluted the Overturned Water themselves to drastically reduce maintenance costs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">When needed, they would purify it again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo had learned this principle from Li Xiangshang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">As a Carp Transformed into a Dragon, Li Xiangshang had been chosen by the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign to cultivate in the Weak Water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Each time he introduced fresh water to dilute the Weak Water, he struggled relentlessly, gradually approaching the level of dormancy until he finally leaped out of the pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Just as with Weak Water, the same principle applied to Overturned Water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zheng Shoumo, who controlled the Ink Pool, had conveniently stored the Overturned Water within it, using it as a daily disguise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zheng Shoumo had once disguised himself, activated the Dragonfall Hidden Scale Dojo, and ambushed Jin Yangzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong had witnessed the entire process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">As a result, Ning Zhuo knew that the internal traitor possessed Overturned Water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">When Ning Zhuo suspected Zheng Shoumo after noticing Yang Weida's flaws, he immediately connected the dots from previous clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Before arriving, Ning Zhuo had secretly speculated: if his hunch was correct, Zheng Shoumo would likely be carrying Overturned Water with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">If he was wrong, at worst he would only be detaining a Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This wouldn't significantly impact the overall situation in White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">As Ning Zhuo had publicly stated, he was no Divine Constable and never claimed any detective skills. He didn't need solid evidence; action was enough. If he was right, excellent. If wrong, no harm done.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">According to Wen Ruanyu, Zheng Shoumo was a follower of Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">If he wrongly accused Zheng Shoumo, Ning Zhuo believed that revealing his true identity would surely earn the man's understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The evidence of Zheng Shoumo's guilt was on his person!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This was the Overturned Water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Once it was discovered, no explanation Zheng Shoumo could offer would dispel the overwhelming suspicion. He harbored no illusions and would never accept being confined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Whether the Overturned Water was found or not, prolonged confinement would inevitably lead to its deterioration. Like food past its expiration date, the Profound Mystery and Subtle Ability within would dissipate, gradually weakening. His combat prowess would plummet accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Overturned Water was Zheng Shoumo's greatest asset.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Defending against the initial assault, Zheng Shoumo thrust his palms forward, unleashing waves of the Overturned Water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Wen Ruanyu, Yang Sanyan, and Ning Zhuo retreated simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The three men instinctively activated their techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Yang Sanyan conjured blades of light, Wen Ruanyu's brush danced across the air, inscribing characters, and Ning Zhuo unleashed hand seals, incantations, and mental commands, cycling through Fire Element techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The spells collided with the Overturned Water, sending waves crashing and steam billowing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu, and Yang Sanyan pushed their spells to the limit, forming protective barriers around themselves. They avoided using their personal magic treasures and artifacts unless absolutely necessary, fearing the Overturned Water would absorb them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zheng Shoumo ascended into the sky, channeling both the Overturned Water and his own magic treasures to strike from all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu, and Yang Sanyan retreated while fighting, finding themselves unexpectedly on the defensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Though Zheng Shoumo held a clear advantage, his expression remained grave. Overturned Water was formidable, but it was particularly effective against magic treasures and artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In a one-on-one confrontation, he could easily force his opponent to resort to such items. Then, by seizing their treasures with Overturned Water, he could trigger a backlash that would severely weaken them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">But now, with Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu, and Yang Sanyan working together, they were able to share the pressure and hold their ground using only techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This created a situation where their techniques were draining Overturned Water, a disadvantageous position for Zheng Shoumo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"I must attack with full force, leaving nothing in reserve! The opportunity is here - we must force out his magic treasures and artifacts!" Zheng Shoumo was about to summon another magic treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Yang Sanyan, proud and arrogant, had long been simmering with anger at being pushed back despite their three-on-one advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Superior natural talent - All Under my Gaze is Emptiness!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">His gaze hardened into a blinding glare that locked onto Overturned Water, causing a large portion of the liquid to vanish instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Yang Sanyan's patience had snapped. With a cold snort, the vertical mark between his brows abruptly split open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The eruption of power instantly shifted the tide of battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"A perfect opportunity!" Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu thought in unison, seizing the moment to strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">One unleashed the Mystic Gold Slash, while the other rapidly inscribed three characters for "kill."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Zheng Shoumo's entire body turned icy, as if plunged into an ice cave, overwhelmed by the palpable killing intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He hastily switched from offense to defense, but his earlier all-out assault had left him vulnerable. Though his reaction was swift, the transition still required precious time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">And that critical moment was the difference between life and death for him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">First, the Mystic Gold Slash shattered his defenses. Then, the three "kill" characters branded themselves directly onto his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Zheng Shoumo coughed up blood and was sent flying backward, his vital energy plummeting to rock bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Overturned Water dissipated, scattering uncontrollably across the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Yang Sanyan, who had neutralized so much of the Overturned Water, had paid a steep price. His third eye, once vibrant, now appeared dull and gray, its vision nearly extinguished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ignoring the cost, he summoned another flying knife.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The blade shot forth like lightning, reaching Zheng Shoumo in an instant. Aiming precisely at his forehead, it sought to pierce his Divine Sea Dantian!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Severely wounded and dazed, Zheng Shoumo couldn't react in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">At the critical moment, a token suddenly activated, flying out from Zheng Shoumo's storage ring and blocking the flying knife.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The token then hovered in mid-air, emitting a dazzling array of mystical light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Within the radiant glow, a swirling archway formed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The archway emitted a powerful suction force, drawing Zheng Shoumo directly into it before vanishing without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The scene left Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu, and Yang Sanyan stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">They had been confident of capturing Zheng Shoumo, yet this unexpected turn of events left them speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"What kind of technique is this?!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">All three turned their bewildered gazes toward the token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The swirling archway had completely disappeared after absorbing Zheng Shoumo, leaving only the token to fall from the sky and land on the grass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Yang Sanyan reached out and summoned the token into his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Upon closer inspection, he saw that the token was riddled with cracks, its surface completely fractured. It wouldn't have been surprising if it had shattered completely at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The token's original patterns and markings were barely discernible beneath the network of fissures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The cracks intertwined like angry lightning bolts and twisted, grotesque shapes, their chaotic arrangement vaguely resembling the image of a gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The aura of the token had plummeted to the mundane, rendering it an ordinary object, not even a low-grade Magic Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">It was clear this miraculous item could only be used once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Wen Ruanyu stepped forward, staring at the shattered token. "What exactly is this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo shared the same question. "The Dao Field isolates the interior from the exterior. Zheng Shoumo personally activated it as the master of the Dragonfall Hidden Scale Dojo. How could he possibly escape directly from it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Yang Sanyan stared intently at the token in his hand, his heart pounding with shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">His face turned ashen. After a long silence, he looked at Wen Ruanyu and Ning Zhuo, his voice low and heavy with shock, apprehension, and solemnity. "It's understandable that you don't recognize this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"All I can say is... this matter is of immense significance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"I must immediately send a flying message to report this to the Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu exchanged bewildered glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Yang Sanyan's gaze swept over Wen Ruanyu before settling on Ning Zhuo. After a moment's hesitation, he said, "Your mother, Meng Yaoyin, and the other fallen geniuses... their deaths may very well be the work of this organization."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"What?!" Ning Zhuo paled, his voice urgent. "What do you mean?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Yang Sanyan shook his head. "This is classified information from the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Demon Subduing Hall! Even Golden Core True Inheritors like Wen Ruanyu are mostly unaware of it. If you wish to learn more, I suggest you join the Myriad Manifestations Sect and apply to serve in the Demon Subduing Hall alongside me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Myriad Manifestations Sect, Demon Subduing Hall..." Ning Zhuo muttered, his brow deeply furrowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He knew his mother had suffered a Dao Injury, but he had never understood its cause. Meng Yaoyin hadn't practiced any unorthodox cultivation methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Now, Yang Sanyan was telling Ning Zhuo that a shadowy organization might have been responsible for his mother's injury. This token, capable of rescuing its bearer from peril, was one of the organization's symbols.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">A surge of anger and bewilderment flooded Ning Zhuo's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Yang Sanyan cast several spells to carefully preserve the shattered token, then tucked it into his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">His face grave, he addressed Wen Ruanyu and Ning Zhuo: "The situation is far more complex than I imagined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Zheng Shoumo is a member of this organization. He's been in White Paper Immortal City for years. If they're trying to seize control of this Immortal City, the reality is likely far worse than we feared."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"I must first investigate the City Lord and other high-ranking officials of the Immortal City. That includes both of you, of course."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Wen Ruanyu replied solemnly, "Please proceed as necessary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo added, "I'm willing to fully cooperate, but this must be done discreetly. White Paper Immortal City is already under siege by both the Ghost Tide and the Yin Soldiers, and the atmosphere within the city is extremely tense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Yang Sanyan nodded slightly, his sharp gaze fixed on Ning Zhuo. "You're probably clean. If you were involved, you wouldn't have triggered Zheng Shoumo, the internal traitor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"I'm starting to seriously doubt the White Paper City Lord!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"The current City Lord of White Paper Immortal City is quite ambitious, and her true form hasn't been publicly revealed in years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo touched the mechanism ring on his finger, but it remained still. "I'd like to accompany Senior Yang to visit the City Lord's true form!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Yang Sanyan's eyes flashed with admiration. "As expected of a descendant of our sect's Golden Core True Inheritor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Wen Ruanyu added, "I wish to go as well!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Good," Yang Sanyan took charge. "Then the three of us will head straight to the City Lord's Mansion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Yang Sanyan dismissed the Dao Field. Without his guidance, the Dragonfall Hidden Scale Dojo dissipated on its own, drawing the attention of nearby cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Wen Ruanyu quickly gave a few instructions to reassure them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">When the trio arrived at the City Lord's Mansion, they were first greeted by the City Lord's Paper Puppet Avatar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Wen Ruanyu clasped his hands in a respectful gesture. "Brother Yang, would you allow me to explain the situation?" He worried that Yang Sanyan's arrogance might lead to unnecessary complications during negotiations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Yang Sanyan glanced at Wen Ruanyu and nodded slightly. "You're also a Golden Core True Inheritor of our sect. I'll give you that courtesy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Ah, it's him," the Paper Puppet Avatar said, showing little surprise. It sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Wen Ruanyu reported to the City Lord's avatar that the internal traitor, Zheng Shoumo, had been exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Yang Sanyan's eyes flashed with sharp intensity as he immediately demanded, "The City Lord doesn't seem surprised?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The White Paper City Lord said, "As the City Lord, I naturally suspected the Heart-Piercing Scroll might be failing when repeated investigations failed to uncover the internal traitor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Zheng Shoumo was one of my primary suspects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"He oversees the Ink Pool, yet he's constantly making mistakes, leading to repeated repairs. It's quite peculiar."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"I secretly sent people to investigate him, but they found nothing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Wen Ruanyu couldn't help but show surprise. He never imagined the City Lord had long suspected Zheng Shoumo and even investigated him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Yang Sanyan frowned. "Why didn't you investigate further? If it were me, I would have thoroughly investigated the suspicious pattern of the Ink Pool's repeated repairs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The White Paper City Lord scoffed. "Young Yang, you're not a City Lord. You wouldn't understand the constraints we face. We can't always act on our own whims."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Zheng Shoumo is one such case."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"He was placed here by Meng Yaoyin, naturally aligning him with the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Moreover, as a Confucian cultivator, he's unusually close to Wen Ruanyu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"If I had pressed the investigation, I might have uncovered evidence that he deliberately caused the damage to embezzle repair funds."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"That would have been detrimental to both of us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Ning Zhuo, Wen Ruanyu, and Yang Sanyan fell into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The White Paper City Lord's words held considerable weight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Meng Yaoyin had made significant contributions to the White Paper Immortal City, even having a colossal paper puppet statue erected in her honor south of the city. Disposing of those she had appointed would severely damage her reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Meng Yaoyin was the White Paper City Lord's handpicked hero, and her image and reputation were intertwined with the City Lord's own prestige.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">By acknowledging Meng Yaoyin's achievements, the City Lord was also signaling goodwill to the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">In a sense, Zheng Shoumo had replaced Meng Yaoyin as the living testament to the alliance between the White Paper Immortal City and the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">His downfall would be detrimental to both the City Lord and the alliance between the Immortal City and the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Therefore, even if he had embezzled maintenance funds, the White Paper City Lord would likely turn a blind eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">It was precisely this consideration that led the City Lord to overlook the suspicious circumstances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Many things in life require a touch of willful ignorance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Wen Ruanyu sighed deeply, breaking the silence. "Perhaps this was Zheng Shoumo's plan all along."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">"On one hand, he used the repeated Ink Pool repairs to secretly tamper with things, nurturing his Overturned Water and making other preparations. Now that I think about it, the Gate of the Underworld that appeared in the Ink River within the city, from which a large number of water ghosts emerged, must have been Zheng Shoumo's doing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">"On the other hand, he used this as a 'shield,' calculating that City Lord, you would prioritize the greater good and choose to remain willfully ignorant. He used this 'shield' to deflect any subsequent investigations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">The White Paper City Lord turned to Ning Zhuo. "We owe everything to our little savior for exposing this man as an internal traitor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Ning Zhuo, still dwelling on Yang Sanyan's earlier words, his eyes flashed with determination. "This isn't over by a long shot. My mother's death is likely connected to this man."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Yang Sanyan produced the shattered token and explained the details of the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">Upon learning that Zheng Shoumo might be a member of this mysterious organization, the paper doll avatar lost its composure, its face contorting in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Yang Sanyan said, "This matter is of grave importance, City Lord. I must meet your true form and sign a Divine Contract with all of you. Otherwise, I can't truly trust any of you. Without trust, how can we defend the city?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">The paper doll avatar remained silent for a long moment before shaking its head with a wry smile. "Very well. Please follow me, all three of you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">The trio exchanged glances. Ning Zhuo stroked his mechanical ring and stepped forward first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">Moments later, they arrived at an underground chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">The paper doll avatar activated a magical formation, revealing the City Lord's true form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">"This?!" Wen Ruanyu's expression twisted in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">Yang Sanyan narrowed his eyes, instinctively concealing the turmoil in his pupils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Ning Zhuo also wore a look of astonishment. He had never imagined the City Lord's true form would be in such a state.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
