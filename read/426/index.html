<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo walked up to the camp gate and showed his token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Young Master Ning Zhuo, please follow me." The guards already recognized Ning Zhuo, and after verifying the token, they assigned someone to lead the way ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This identity token was also given to Ning Zhuo by Zhang Chongyi after the last healing session.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Familiar with the route, Ning Zhuo arrived at the physician's tent. He entered and greeted, "Senior Zhang, this junior has come to trouble you again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Seeing Ning Zhuo, Zhang Chongyi stroked his beard and smiled, "No problem, young friend. Please have a seat here first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After sitting down, Ning Zhuo untied his waistband.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He held the shrunken Ten thousand Li Traversing Dragon in one hand and showed it to Zhang Chongyi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zhang Chongyi focused his gaze, his expression slightly surprised, "It's actually a Mechanical Dragon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"The last time I saw your friend suddenly appear, I thought it was something like a Hidden Soldier Talisman or a Portable Military Order."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Your blade-friend's wealth is truly rare."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo showed half of the dragon's body to Zhang Chongyi, telling him that the Mechanical Dragon had been affected by the Blood Shadow Cave Master's spell, and as long as it got close to the Thousand Peaks Forest, it would be detected by the Blood Shadow Cave Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"I'd like to ask senior to assist once more and help us eliminate this hidden danger," Ning Zhuo said straightforwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhang Chongyi first took the Mechanical Dragon, examined it closely, occasionally forming hand seals and casting spells to probe it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After a moment, his slightly furrowed brows relaxed, "It is indeed the Blood Trace Shadow Tracking Technique of the Blood Shadow Cave Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Resolving this is not difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Turning his tone, Zhang Chongyi expressed that he was, after all, no longer a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, currently only at the Golden Core stage; to resolve the Blood Trace Shadow Tracking Technique, he would need external tools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"If there were a Nascent Soul-level alchemy furnace, along with some medicinal ingredients, and continuously refining for twelve days, the spell could be removed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Unfortunately, as far as I know, the entire Celestial City of Green Forest doesn't have such an alchemy furnace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Alchemical furnaces of such production caliber are often extremely expensive. A Nascent Soul-level alchemy furnace of excellent quality could cost a Nascent Soul-level cultivator most of their lifetime's wealth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Zhang Chongyi, once an imperial physician, also hadn't accumulated enough wealth to own his own Nascent Soul-level alchemy furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"What can we do about this?" Ning Zhuo sighed, his eyes turning, "If not an alchemy furnace, could we use a refining furnace instead?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zhang Chongyi marveled at Ning Zhuo's quick thinking, immediately nodding, "That's exactly what I was about to say. Currently, there's a Nascent Soul-level refining furnace in Celestial City of Green Forest, controlled by the nation's grand craftsman Jin Li."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Through him, we can also resolve this Blood Trace Shadow Tracking Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo pondered silently, somewhat hesitant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He trusted Zhang Chongyi more, but didn't know much about Jin Li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Through the Life Thread and the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal, he could deal with Zhang Chongyi, but Jin Li was at the Nascent Soul level; if anything went wrong, it wouldn't be a situation he could handle at his current level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhang Chongyi saw Ning Zhuo's hesitation and said, "I know Jin Li quite well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"He is upright, straightforward, his words as sharp as a blade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Moreover, we can sign a contract to ensure that no one else will know the fact that you possess the Mechanical Dragon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"However, to invite him will not be cheap. You need to be prepared."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">After all, Jin Li is at the Nascent Soul level and is a national craftsman; this time coming to Celestial City of Green Forest, he has heavy refining tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">To get him to spare time to do private work, you must offer something that can move his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong discussed briefly via divine sense transmission, then nodded and said to Zhang Chongyi, "We'll go with what senior suggests."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zhang Chongyi immediately wrote a flying message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The flying message flew out of the tent, heading directly to Celestial City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Taking advantage of this moment, Zhang Chongyi dismissed others and spoke only to Ning Zhuo, "I also have a matter that I need to ask of you, young friend."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Of course, it's just a proposal. If you are unwilling, then forget it; just keep this matter strictly confidential."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">As he said this, it immediately aroused the curiosity of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong. Especially Sun Lingtong, who immediately pricked up his ears inside the mechanical dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo immediately stated that as long as it was within his ability, he would do his best.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zhang Chongyi smiled, "This matter is indeed difficult if you say so, but also quite easy if you say so; perhaps it's just a matter of your decision."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"However, this is a military matter; before I explain, let's first set a contract."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Also, your friend, if he wants to listen in, please also set a contract."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As soon as he finished speaking, Sun Lingtong jumped out of the mechanical swimming dragon, his attitude quite enthusiastic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Seeing Zhang Chongyi so serious, Ning Zhuo's expression became slightly solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">After the contract was established, Zhang Chongyi looked at Sun and Ning, and softly proposed the idea of dual cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Dual cultivation? Me and General Mu Lan?!" Ning Zhuo's eyes widened, pointing at himself with five fingers, utterly shocked for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In his view, this was too much of a leap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Hahaha, Little Zhuo, this is a great thing!" Sun Lingtong, upon hearing this, laughed so hard he leaned forward and back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He really enjoyed such fun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zhang Chongyi sighed deeply and explained the details to the two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"The Female Gold Armor-Breaking Technique?" Ning Zhuo lightly furrowed his brow, "Perhaps I can improve this technique to help the general. No need for dual cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Please don't blame me, senior. It's not that I'm being arrogant, but involving my primordial yang has extremely significant implications for my path in this life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zhang Chongyi nodded, "Indeed, so it requires careful consideration."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong glanced at Ning Zhuo, "Little Zhuo, you're not like me practicing the Virgin Boy Technique. The Three Sect Superior Method you're cultivating, I've seen it too. Primordial yang isn't that important to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Moreover, haven't you always been telling me that you dislike your slow cultivation progress? Now with dual cultivation, there's a Golden Core-level partner giving you empowerment; your cultivation will advance by leaps and bounds!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhang Chongyi's eyes lit up slightly, stroking his beard and laughing, "If both parties are willing, this would be a joyous event, hahaha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo hurriedly waved his hands, "I'm just a small Foundation Establishment cultivator; General Mu Lan is a Golden Core cultivator, commanding an army. If I were to dual cultivate with General Mu Lan, it would truly be overreaching."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Moreover, dual cultivation is a significant matter; I must report to my family's ancestors and obtain the family's approval before proceeding with such a major event."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zhang Chongyi heard the evasion in Ning Zhuo's words, the smile on his face faded, and he nodded, "Involving primordial yang and primordial yin, dual cultivation is indeed a major matter and requires careful consideration."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">As they were speaking, a flying message flew into the tent and landed in front of Zhang Chongyi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">It was Jin Li's reply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zhang Chongyi opened and read it, slightly surprised, "Brother Jin agreed, but he asks for as compensation the Nascent Soul-level treasure material in young friend Ning Zhuo's possession..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This did not exceed Ning Zhuo's expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He smiled bitterly, giving Zhang Chongyi the same explanation as before, saying that it's a family task to trade with some major power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment, "Family tasks are important, but removing the Blood Trace Shadow Tracking Technique is equally important. I've decided to agree to Grand Craftsman Jin Li's request and ask for his assistance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Immediately, the three—Zhang Chongyi, Ning Zhuo, and Sun Lingtong —brought the mechanical dragon to see Jin Li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After Zhang Chongyi and Jin Li discussed, combining their strengths, they came up with several methods to remove the Blood Trace Shadow Tracking Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">After Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong discussed briefly, they quickly made a choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">They chose the fastest method, and for this, they had to pay a greater price. The cost was not more remuneration but that the Mechanical Dragon would be damaged in many places due to the aggressive method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">But to return to the Old Monster in the Stone as soon as possible and avoid complications from delays, such a decision was undoubtedly wise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo watched as the Mechanical Dragon entered the refining furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The furnace door closed, flames rose, beginning to burn fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">According to Jin Li and Zhang Chongyi's estimation, it would take as fast as three days and nights, or as slow as four days and five nights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Without the Mechanical Dragon wrapped around his waist, Ning Zhuo felt unaccustomed for a while, a bit empty inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Although Sun Lingtong had an injury on his right arm, he couldn't hold back and temporarily parted ways with Ning Zhuo, going into Celestial City of Green Forest to have fun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Alone, Ning Zhuo returned to the Three Generals Camp, slipped into his own tent, and began his daily cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He first took out the Stream Ball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This magical artifact was issued jointly by three families in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City and is still effective to this day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo then activated the Floating Cloud Scarf.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Since using it in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he seemed to have developed this habit; without wrapping himself in the Floating Cloud Scarf, he always felt a bit uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Layers of floating clouds covered Ning Zhuo's entire body, wrapping him into a large cotton ball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Inside the cotton ball, Ning Zhuo took out various spiritual foods and stuffed them into his mouth one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Compared to pills, spiritual foods have a shorter shelf life, but fortunately, they have no medicinal properties, allowing cultivators to fully absorb them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The spiritual foods of Green Forest Immortal City mostly have sweet and spicy flavors. Ning Zhuo wasn't quite used to it yet and choked once in the middle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He first cultivated the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Demonic light shone on his face, making it entirely blood-red, with vein-like membranes faintly visible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">In his lower dantian, a scarlet red ground, with blood veins crisscrossing, spreading and intertwining into a net, covering the entire ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">After a large amount of spiritual food was digested, it was refined into essence blood, added to the blood field, making the blood vein carpet even more robust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo then cultivated the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He took out the magical artifact Tornado Windmill, pressing it against his middle dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">In the Five Qi Heavenly Pivot Dantian, five-colored vortices like tornadoes stood towering. The five-colored five-element mana was sometimes distinctly separate, sometimes mixed into one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Under the blessing of the Tornado Windmill, the vortices accelerated their rotation, absorbing external spiritual energy, converting it into his own mana faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">When cultivating the Mirror Platform Spiritual Communication Technique, he used the Tranquil Heart Bell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The sound of the bell rang, allowing him to quickly enter a meditative state, delving deeper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In the Bright Mirror Spiritual Light Dantian, thoughts arose one after another, generating in large quantities. Distractions were eliminated, actively extinguished, the unique mirror thoughts combined with each other, transforming into flat mirrors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">At the extremes of above and below, there were two huge mirror surfaces each, serving as the heaven and earth within the dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">And within the dantian, the most conspicuous was the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In addition, there was the divine ability Life Thread of the Illusory True Lotus Seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"According to common knowledge, the Foundation Establishment stage is mainly divided into six phases, corresponding to the early, middle, and late stages of Foundation Establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"They are Opening the Field Unhindered, Nourishing the Treasure Medicine, Dantian Birthing Radiance, Wondrous Visions Sowing Talismans, Golden Light Shining Within, and Changing Void to Substance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"The Three Sect Superior Method is a superior method, and the content in the Foundation Establishment chapters precisely includes these six phases."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">If it were an earlier cultivation method, ity might not include these six phases.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">New methods are excellent; compared to old ones, they could better enhance a cultivator's foundation and more comprehensively elevate a cultivator's power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Looking throughout history, later-generation Foundation Establishment cultivators, because they practiced new methods, were often stronger than predecessors from earlier eras.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">In Ning Zhuo's hands was the Five Zang Temple Spiritual Divine Art; this cultivation method was too ancient, and the early, middle, and late stages of Foundation Establishment had no differences at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">If forced to calculate, there was only the last phase "Turning Illusory into Treasure," and even that was mixed with the final tribulation to form the core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Unlike current cultivation methods, which separate the two, making them more refined and better for sculpting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Every day, the time I invest in cultivation is three times that of ordinary people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Usually, the daily cultivation cost for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, converted into spirit stones, is about 1,500 lower-grade spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"The various spiritual foods I eat and the cost of the magical artifacts I use, when converted, my daily consumption is 5,000 lower-grade spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Even so, I haven't reached the state of Opening the Field Unimpeded, not even a hint of a sign."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">As Ning Zhuo traveled the world, he faced more and more powerful opponents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Sometimes, he even had to face threats at the Nascent Soul level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The situations where Foundation Establishment cultivators only needed to deal with opponents similar to themselves, or at most a bit stronger, basically only exist in storybooks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Reality was cruel; it would't treat you kindly because you were weak; in fact, it was quite the opposite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo really wanted his cultivation level to increase rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He once consulted Sun Lingtong on this matter, but was persuaded by the latter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo also knew that what Sun Lingtong said made sense; his own progress was actually very fast. A sixteen-year-old Foundation Establishment cultivator —this achievement was outstanding in the entire cultivation world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">But Ning Zhuo still wanted his cultivation level to increase greatly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Especially this time, being suggested by Zhang Chongyi to dual cultivate with Mu Lan, further stimulated this idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"I really want my cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Being only in the early Foundation Establishment stage, there are many things I can't do; it's really uncomfortable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Though Ning Zhuo had politely refused Zhang Zhongyi, he was secretly moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">f he were to dual cultivate with Mu Lan, his cultivation would surge. Moreover, with Mu Lan's special circumstances, he would be infused with even more cultivation, causing an even more dramatic increase!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Losing primordial yang isn't a big deal, but the significance of a dual cultivation partner is extremely important."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"Dual cultivation where primordial yang and primordial yin converge only happens once in a lifetime. Therefore, the choice of Dao companion is very critical; there's only one spot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"After dual cultivation, the relationship between the two will be very close, and the effectiveness of subsequent dual cultivation is far higher than that of ordinary people, creating a bond even closer than marriage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"As the clan leader of the Ning family's branch, am I to form a dao companion with the daughter of a two-note national general's mansion?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo was very clear about the differences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">If Lin Shanshan's feelings toward Ning Zhuo were romantic, and Hua Guzi's affection stemmed from desire, then Mu Lan's attitude toward Ning Zhuo was completely based on cold, calculated interests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo did not reject this at all. He had seen many such arrangements in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and learned much about them from books.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"This is how the righteous path operates," Ning Zhuo just couldn't determine whether he would profit or lose from this potential dual cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Would he have better choices in the future?</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
