<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo walked up to the camp gate and showed his token.<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo, please follow me." The guards already recognized Ning Zhuo, and after verifying the token, they assigned someone to lead the way ahead.<br/>
<br/>
This identity token was also given to Ning Zhuo by Zhang Chongyi after the last healing session.<br/>
<br/>
Familiar with the route, Ning Zhuo arrived at the physician's tent. He entered and greeted, "Senior Zhang, this junior has come to trouble you again."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo, Zhang Chongyi stroked his beard and smiled, "No problem, young friend. Please have a seat here first."<br/>
<br/>
After sitting down, Ning Zhuo untied his waistband.<br/>
<br/>
He held the shrunken Ten thousand Li Traversing Dragon in one hand and showed it to Zhang Chongyi.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi focused his gaze, his expression slightly surprised, "It's actually a Mechanical Dragon."<br/>
<br/>
"The last time I saw your friend suddenly appear, I thought it was something like a Hidden Soldier Talisman or a Portable Military Order."<br/>
<br/>
"Your blade-friend's wealth is truly rare."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo showed half of the dragon's body to Zhang Chongyi, telling him that the Mechanical Dragon had been affected by the Blood Shadow Cave Master's spell, and as long as it got close to the Thousand Peaks Forest, it would be detected by the Blood Shadow Cave Master.<br/>
<br/>
"I'd like to ask senior to assist once more and help us eliminate this hidden danger," Ning Zhuo said straightforwardly.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi first took the Mechanical Dragon, examined it closely, occasionally forming hand seals and casting spells to probe it.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment, his slightly furrowed brows relaxed, "It is indeed the Blood Trace Shadow Tracking Technique of the Blood Shadow Cave Master."<br/>
<br/>
"Resolving this is not difficult."<br/>
<br/>
Turning his tone, Zhang Chongyi expressed that he was, after all, no longer a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, currently only at the Golden Core stage; to resolve the Blood Trace Shadow Tracking Technique, he would need external tools.<br/>
<br/>
"If there were a Nascent Soul-level alchemy furnace, along with some medicinal ingredients, and continuously refining for twelve days, the spell could be removed."<br/>
<br/>
"Unfortunately, as far as I know, the entire Celestial City of Green Forest doesn't have such an alchemy furnace."<br/>
<br/>
Alchemical furnaces of such production caliber are often extremely expensive. A Nascent Soul-level alchemy furnace of excellent quality could cost a Nascent Soul-level cultivator most of their lifetime's wealth.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi, once an imperial physician, also hadn't accumulated enough wealth to own his own Nascent Soul-level alchemy furnace.<br/>
<br/>
"What can we do about this?" Ning Zhuo sighed, his eyes turning, "If not an alchemy furnace, could we use a refining furnace instead?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi marveled at Ning Zhuo's quick thinking, immediately nodding, "That's exactly what I was about to say. Currently, there's a Nascent Soul-level refining furnace in Celestial City of Green Forest, controlled by the nation's grand craftsman Jin Li."<br/>
<br/>
"Through him, we can also resolve this Blood Trace Shadow Tracking Technique."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered silently, somewhat hesitant.<br/>
<br/>
He trusted Zhang Chongyi more, but didn't know much about Jin Li.<br/>
<br/>
Through the Life Thread and the My Buddha Heart Demon Seal, he could deal with Zhang Chongyi, but Jin Li was at the Nascent Soul level; if anything went wrong, it wouldn't be a situation he could handle at his current level.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi saw Ning Zhuo's hesitation and said, "I know Jin Li quite well."<br/>
<br/>
"He is upright, straightforward, his words as sharp as a blade."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, we can sign a contract to ensure that no one else will know the fact that you possess the Mechanical Dragon."<br/>
<br/>
"However, to invite him will not be cheap. You need to be prepared."<br/>
<br/>
After all, Jin Li is at the Nascent Soul level and is a national craftsman; this time coming to Celestial City of Green Forest, he has heavy refining tasks.<br/>
<br/>
To get him to spare time to do private work, you must offer something that can move his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong discussed briefly via divine sense transmission, then nodded and said to Zhang Chongyi, "We'll go with what senior suggests."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi immediately wrote a flying message.<br/>
<br/>
The flying message flew out of the tent, heading directly to Celestial City of Green Forest.<br/>
<br/>
Taking advantage of this moment, Zhang Chongyi dismissed others and spoke only to Ning Zhuo, "I also have a matter that I need to ask of you, young friend."<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, it's just a proposal. If you are unwilling, then forget it; just keep this matter strictly confidential."<br/>
<br/>
As he said this, it immediately aroused the curiosity of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong. Especially Sun Lingtong, who immediately pricked up his ears inside the mechanical dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately stated that as long as it was within his ability, he would do his best.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi smiled, "This matter is indeed difficult if you say so, but also quite easy if you say so; perhaps it's just a matter of your decision."<br/>
<br/>
"However, this is a military matter; before I explain, let's first set a contract."<br/>
<br/>
"Also, your friend, if he wants to listen in, please also set a contract."<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he finished speaking, Sun Lingtong jumped out of the mechanical swimming dragon, his attitude quite enthusiastic.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Zhang Chongyi so serious, Ning Zhuo's expression became slightly solemn.<br/>
<br/>
After the contract was established, Zhang Chongyi looked at Sun and Ning, and softly proposed the idea of dual cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
"Dual cultivation? Me and General Mulan?!" Ning Zhuo's eyes widened, pointing at himself with five fingers, utterly shocked for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
In his view, this was too much of a leap.<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha, Little Zhuo, this is a great thing!" Sun Lingtong, upon hearing this, laughed so hard he leaned forward and back.<br/>
<br/>
He really enjoyed such fun.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi sighed deeply and explained the details to the two.<br/>
<br/>
"The Female Gold Armor-Breaking Technique?" Ning Zhuo lightly furrowed his brow, "Perhaps I can improve this technique to help the general. No need for dual cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
"Please don't blame me, senior. It's not that I'm being arrogant, but involving my primordial yang has extremely significant implications for my path in this life."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi nodded, "Indeed, so it requires careful consideration."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong glanced at Ning Zhuo, "Little Zhuo, you're not like me practicing the Virgin Boy Technique. The Three Sect Superior Method you're cultivating, I've seen it too. Primordial yang isn't that important to you."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, haven't you always been telling me that you dislike your slow cultivation progress? Now with dual cultivation, there's a Golden Core-level partner giving you empowerment; your cultivation will advance by leaps and bounds!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi's eyes lit up slightly, stroking his beard and laughing, "If both parties are willing, this would be a joyous event, hahaha."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly waved his hands, "I'm just a small Foundation Establishment cultivator; General Mulan is a Golden Core cultivator, commanding an army. If I were to dual cultivate with General Mulan, it would truly be overreaching."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, dual cultivation is a significant matter; I must report to my family's ancestors and obtain the family's approval before proceeding with such a major event."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi heard the evasion in Ning Zhuo's words, the smile on his face faded, and he nodded, "Involving primordial yang and primordial yin, dual cultivation is indeed a major matter and requires careful consideration."<br/>
<br/>
As they were speaking, a flying message flew into the tent and landed in front of Zhang Chongyi.<br/>
<br/>
It was Jin Li's reply.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi opened and read it, slightly surprised, "Brother Jin agreed, but he asks for as compensation the Nascent Soul-level treasure material in young friend Ning Zhuo's possession..."<br/>
<br/>
This did not exceed Ning Zhuo's expectations.<br/>
<br/>
He smiled bitterly, giving Zhang Chongyi the same explanation as before, saying that it's a family task to trade with some major power.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment, "Family tasks are important, but removing the Blood Trace Shadow Tracking Technique is equally important. I've decided to agree to Grand Craftsman Jin Li's request and ask for his assistance!"<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, the three‚ÄîZhang Chongyi, Ning Zhuo, and Sun Lingtong ‚Äîbrought the mechanical dragon to see Jin Li.<br/>
<br/>
After Zhang Chongyi and Jin Li discussed, combining their strengths, they came up with several methods to remove the Blood Trace Shadow Tracking Technique.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong discussed briefly, they quickly made a choice.<br/>
<br/>
They chose the fastest method, and for this, they had to pay a greater price. The cost was not more remuneration but that the Mechanical Dragon would be damaged in many places due to the aggressive method.<br/>
<br/>
But to return to the Old Monster in the Stone as soon as possible and avoid complications from delays, such a decision was undoubtedly wise.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo watched as the Mechanical Dragon entered the refining furnace.<br/>
<br/>
The furnace door closed, flames rose, beginning to burn fiercely.<br/>
<br/>
According to Jin Li and Zhang Chongyi's estimation, it would take as fast as three days and nights, or as slow as four days and five nights.<br/>
<br/>
Without the Mechanical Dragon wrapped around his waist, Ning Zhuo felt unaccustomed for a while, a bit empty inside.<br/>
<br/>
Although Sun Lingtong had an injury on his right arm, he couldn't hold back and temporarily parted ways with Ning Zhuo, going into Celestial City of Green Forest to have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Alone, Ning Zhuo returned to the Three Generals Camp, slipped into his own tent, and began his daily cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
He first took out the Stream Ball.<br/>
<br/>
This magical artifact was issued jointly by three families in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City and is still effective to this day.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then activated the Floating Cloud Scarf.<br/>
<br/>
Since using it in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he seemed to have developed this habit; without wrapping himself in the Floating Cloud Scarf, he always felt a bit uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Layers of floating clouds covered Ning Zhuo's entire body, wrapping him into a large cotton ball.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the cotton ball, Ning Zhuo took out various spiritual foods and stuffed them into his mouth one after another.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to pills, spiritual foods have a shorter shelf life, but fortunately, they have no medicinal properties, allowing cultivators to fully absorb them.<br/>
<br/>
The spiritual foods of Green Forest Immortal City mostly have sweet and spicy flavors. Ning Zhuo wasn't quite used to it yet and choked once in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
He first cultivated the Demonic Blood Tendon Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Demonic light shone on his face, making it entirely blood-red, with vein-like membranes faintly visible.<br/>
<br/>
In his lower dantian, a scarlet red ground, with blood veins crisscrossing, spreading and intertwining into a net, covering the entire ground.<br/>
<br/>
After a large amount of spiritual food was digested, it was refined into essence blood, added to the blood field, making the blood vein carpet even more robust.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then cultivated the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
He took out the magical artifact Tornado Windmill, pressing it against his middle dantian.<br/>
<br/>
In the Five Qi Heavenly Pivot Dantian, five-colored vortices like tornadoes stood towering. The five-colored five-element mana was sometimes distinctly separate, sometimes mixed into one.<br/>
<br/>
Under the blessing of the Tornado Windmill, the vortices accelerated their rotation, absorbing external spiritual energy, converting it into his own mana faster.<br/>
<br/>
When cultivating the Mirror Platform Spiritual Communication Technique, he used the Tranquil Heart Bell.<br/>
<br/>
The sound of the bell rang, allowing him to quickly enter a meditative state, delving deeper.<br/>
<br/>
In the Bright Mirror Spiritual Light Dantian, thoughts arose one after another, generating in large quantities. Distractions were eliminated, actively extinguished, the unique mirror thoughts combined with each other, transforming into flat mirrors.<br/>
<br/>
At the extremes of above and below, there were two huge mirror surfaces each, serving as the heaven and earth within the dantian.<br/>
<br/>
And within the dantian, the most conspicuous was the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, there was the divine ability Life Thread of the Illusory True Lotus Seed.<br/>
<br/>
"According to common knowledge, the Foundation Establishment stage is mainly divided into six phases, corresponding to the early, middle, and late stages of Foundation Establishment."<br/>
<br/>
"They are Opening the Field Unimpeded, Precious Medicine Bathing Life, Dantian Shining, Phenomenon Seed Symbol, Golden Light Inner Illumination, and Turning Illusory into Reality."<br/>
<br/>
"The Three Sect Superior Method is a superior method, and the content in the Foundation Establishment chapters precisely includes these six phases."<br/>
<br/>
If it were an earlier cultivation method, ity might not include these six phases.<br/>
<br/>
New methods are excellent; compared to old ones, they could better enhance a cultivator's foundation and more comprehensively elevate a cultivator's power.<br/>
<br/>
Looking throughout history, later-generation Foundation Establishment cultivators, because they practiced new methods, were often stronger than predecessors from earlier eras.<br/>
<br/>
In Ning Zhuo's hands was the Five Zang Temple Spiritual Divine Art; this cultivation method was too ancient, and the early, middle, and late stages of Foundation Establishment had no differences at all.<br/>
<br/>
If forced to calculate, there was only the last phase "Turning Illusory into Treasure," and even that was mixed with the final tribulation to form the core.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike current cultivation methods, which separate the two, making them more refined and better for sculpting.<br/>
<br/>
"Every day, the time I invest in cultivation is three times that of ordinary people."<br/>
<br/>
"Usually, the daily cultivation cost for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, converted into spirit stones, is about 1,500 lower-grade spirit stones."<br/>
<br/>
"The various spiritual foods I eat and the cost of the magical artifacts I use, when converted, my daily consumption is 5,000 lower-grade spirit stones."<br/>
<br/>
"Even so, I haven't reached the state of Opening the Field Unimpeded, not even a hint of a sign."<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo traveled the world, he faced more and more powerful opponents.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, he even had to face threats at the Nascent Soul level!<br/>
<br/>
The situations where Foundation Establishment cultivators only needed to deal with opponents similar to themselves, or at most a bit stronger, basically only exist in storybooks.<br/>
<br/>
Reality was cruel; it would't treat you kindly because you were weak; in fact, it was quite the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo really wanted his cultivation level to increase rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
He once consulted Sun Lingtong on this matter, but was persuaded by the latter.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also knew that what Sun Lingtong said made sense; his own progress was actually very fast. A sixteen-year-old Foundation Establishment cultivator ‚Äîthis achievement was outstanding in the entire cultivation world.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo still wanted his cultivation level to increase greatly!<br/>
<br/>
Especially this time, being suggested by Zhang Chongyi to dual cultivate with Mulan, further stimulated this idea.<br/>
<br/>
"I really want my cultivation to advance by leaps and bounds!"<br/>
<br/>
"Being only in the early Foundation Establishment stage, there are many things I can't do; it's really uncomfortable."<br/>
<br/>
Though Ning Zhuo had politely refused Zhang Zhongyi, he was secretly moved.<br/>
<br/>
f he were to dual cultivate with Mu Lan, his cultivation would surge. Moreover, with Mu Lan's special circumstances, he would be infused with even more cultivation, causing an even more dramatic increase!<br/>
<br/>
"Losing primordial yang isn't a big deal, but the significance of a dual cultivation partner is extremely important."<br/>
<br/>
"Dual cultivation where primordial yang and primordial yin converge only happens once in a lifetime. Therefore, the choice of Dao companion is very critical; there's only one spot."<br/>
<br/>
"After dual cultivation, the relationship between the two will be very close, and the effectiveness of subsequent dual cultivation is far higher than that of ordinary people, creating a bond even closer than marriage."<br/>
<br/>
"As the clan leader of the Ning family's branch, am I to form a dao companion with the daughter of a two-note national general's mansion?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was very clear about the differences.<br/>
<br/>
If Lin Shanshan's feelings toward Ning Zhuo were romantic, and Hua Guzi's affection stemmed from desire, then Mu Lan's attitude toward Ning Zhuo was completely based on cold, calculated interests.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not reject this at all. He had seen many such arrangements in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and learned much about them from books.<br/>
<br/>
"This is how the righteous path operates," Ning Zhuo just couldn't determine whether he would profit or lose from this potential dual cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Would he have better choices in the future?</div>
