<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 768: Eliminating Ban Ji</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The wind came from the heavens, rolling up ten thousand hectares of cloud wisps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The sea of clouds churned, sometimes gathering like the collapse of a snow-capped mountain, other times scattering like tearing white silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Under the shade of a pine tree, Ban Jie sat upright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">She held a teacup in one hand, inhaling the fragrance of the tea, while her mind pondered the latest battle situation in the Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Just a moment ago, the latest intelligence had been delivered to her hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"In the battle of the three Golden Core cultivators, Tie Zheng won."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"This was expected, and it is also the result I wanted to achieve."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ban Jie knew well the strength of the Blade Beast! Especially since Tie Zheng had already used the Blade Beast in the second trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">If Ao Pan and Lu Zeng did not have other trump cards, Tie Zheng would inevitably win. The advantage the Blade Beast brought him was too great.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Sure enough, Ao Pan and Lu Zeng were eliminated one after another, and Tie Zheng, fighting one against two, won by relying on the Blade Beast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Even so, the Blade Beast cannot fight for long periods; he has been weakened as much as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">If it were before, Tie Zheng and Ao Pan would have joined forces to deal with Lu Zeng. The final winner would still have been Tie Zheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">But now, although Tie Zheng had eliminated Ao Pan and Lu Zeng, his consumption was much greater than in the previous scenario.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"An artifact like the Blade Beast is inherently unsuited for prolonged battles. And the Blade Beast 'Sweeping Light', being made primarily of Profound Weapon Armor materials, is even less durable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Tie Zheng has a Heart Demon; he must have fought with all his might just now. After this bloody struggle, how much longer can the Blade Beast 'Sweeping Light' fight?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ban Jie smiled faintly, thinking of Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"My second wave of ambushers has already severely injured Ning Zhuo. Next, they will fight Tie Zheng with all their strength, which will definitely weaken the latter further, creating the final opportunity for Ban Ji."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Ning Zhuo has been heavily injured and has even lost his shield. He is Ban Ji's Human Tribulation; it is only meaningful if Ban Ji breaks it himself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">As Ban Jie pondered, the pair of profound copper brow studs at her temples rotated incessantly like gear pivots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Next, under the watch of the second wave of ambushers, Ban Ji will personally eliminate Ning Zhuo, and then sweep away the other Foundation Establishment cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"After Tie Zheng is weakened, he will engage in the final struggle with Ban Ji."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Whether victory can be achieved in the end depends on Ban Ji's performance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Going to this extent should be just right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ban Jie needed to leave enough difficulty for Ban Ji; without tempering, the Royal Mandate could not be stimulated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The sea of clouds was reflected in her deep, dark eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"It is just that the second wave of ambushers is, after all, a bit excessive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"I will need to proactively apologize to the Profound Armor Cave afterward! After all, when Ban Ji joins the Myriad Manifestations Sect in the future, he will be seeing the Profound Armor Cave side constantly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ban Jie was appointed here by the Ban family, so naturally, she possessed strategic acumen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">At this moment, the Rising Cloud Minor Test had not yet ended, but she was already calculating how to wrap things up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The cultivators of the Profound Armor Cave generally had unsightly expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"One wave of people came before, and now there is a second wave?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The Ban family is going too far! Blatantly cheating - where does that leave the reputation of our Profound Armor Cave?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In every session of the Flying Cloud Assembly, the Profound Armor Cave held countless Rising Cloud Minor Tests with the same content. If they left people with the impression of large-scale fraud, it would be a significant blow to their prestige.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">As long as there was fraud, it proved they lacked fairness, and cultivators coming to participate in the Rising Cloud Minor Test would consider and hesitate more. At the same time, it also proved that their internal personnel had been corrupted. This would also make outsiders look down on the internal force that was the Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Cultivator Hao crossed his arms, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He was exactly one of the people who had been corrupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"The Ban family isn't playing by the rules. To support Ban Ji, they actually made it this obvious!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Once this Rising Cloud Minor Test is over, the higher-ups will definitely send someone to investigate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">When that time came, and they found out that Cultivator Hao had accepted bribes, he would inevitably suffer punishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"The Ban family didn't just bribe me alone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Fortunately, I saw the situation was bad and made preparations in advance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Otherwise, I would be in a compromised position right now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Cultivator Hao quickly scanned the surroundings, sneering in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="87"/>
<paragraph index="89">Ban Ji watched as several people cupped their fists and bowed to him. He squeezed out a smile on his face, but his feet retreated repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He muttered in his heart: "Is this also Ban Jie's handiwork?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The second wave of ambushers made up an excuse, saying they had received kindness from the Ban family and were ambushing Ning Zhuo to repay that kindness. No one present believed this reason, and Ban Ji was naturally no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He just couldn't quite figure it out: "Since so many people infiltrated, why didn't they attack with full force during the first wave?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Is it that Ban Jie didn't want to make a big fanfare?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"This move is tantamount to public cheating; it will indeed strain the relationship between our side and the Profound Armor Cave!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Regardless of that, I'll eliminate this kid Ning Zhuo first!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">A sharp glint flashed through Ban Ji's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">From the very beginning of this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, Ning Zhuo had brought him a lot of trouble; now he was going to settle the score properly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo was in poor condition. His physical body had undergone multiple repairs, and at this moment he was exhausted, his wounds still bleeding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Take his life while he is hurt!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Upholding this concept, Ban Ji held his weapon and prepared to lunge at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Xiu xiu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Two arrows struck, carrying the power of the Fire Element and Ice Element respectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ban Ji hurriedly dodged, looking at the source of the arrows in bewilderment: "Lord Tie Zheng, what is your intention?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Tie Zheng's eyes were filled with disdain and disgust: "Do you not know that I hate hypocrisy and betrayal the most?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He had a Demonic Heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At this moment, although he had eliminated Ao Pan, he was still in a certain state of stress response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Previously, the second wave of ambushers had been cooperating with Ning Zhuo to besiege Ban Ji, but then suddenly "betrayed" their comrade Ning Zhuo and helped Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Although Tie Zheng cultivated alone in the wilderness, he came from a large clan and was certainly not stupid; he saw through the trickery at a glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The situation of Ning Zhuo suffering betrayal was just like how he had just suffered "betrayal" by Ao Pan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Tie Zheng walked slowly toward Ban Ji: "Nothing but hypocritical and shameless people. If you had set out your chariots and horses from the start and said you wanted to repay a debt, besieging Ning Zhuo would have been fine. But you insisted on pretending to be comrades first, then sneak attacking..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"How many times have you done this? How many people have you framed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Meeting me today means Heaven wants to teach you a lesson!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">After speaking, Tie Zheng attacked Ban Ji and his group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ban Ji: ?!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He hurriedly spoke up to explain, but the more he explained, the more resentful Tie Zheng became, recalling how when he had sought confrontation with those who had harmed him after suffering betrayal, they had behaved exactly the same way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Go to die, go to die!!" Tie Zheng's eyes were filled with bloodshot streaks as he whipped up a storm of gold and iron once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ban Ji was so angry he wanted to vomit blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">What kind of huge grudge is this? Acting like I killed your father.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ban Ji had no choice but to step forward and fight. Fortunately, there were several experts there to help him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Added to the suppression of the Profound Armor Cave's Grand Formation, Tie Zheng could not display the true combat power of a Golden Core cultivator. Thus, although the fight between the two sides was intense, it fell into a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">There were other Foundation Establishment cultivators present. Seeing these two sides fighting, they looked at each other in dismay for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Hmph, I've seen through the Ban family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"This Righteous Path family is somewhat shameless. They spare no effort in cheating just to support their own Foundation Establishment figurehead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Before, I thought it strange - why would the Ban family tolerate a Demonic Cultivator like Ban Ji? Now I understand. Although this family is of the Righteous Path, they are hypocritical to the bone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Regarding Tie Zheng choosing to fight Ban Ji and the others, even if some cultivators didn't know Tie Zheng's intelligence, they didn't find it strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">After all, after Ning Zhuo was sneak-attacked, Ban Ji's group was exposed as the most threatening group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Tie Zheng dealing with Ban Ji's gang was just like him eliminating Lu Zeng and Ao Pan in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"By the way, Ning Zhuo is injured quite badly." Some people stared maliciously at the big-headed youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo's name as a genius had already been circulating constantly in the Myriad Manifestations Sect main mountain gate. In the hearts of the cultivators, he was also very threatening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Now, many cultivators saw that Ban Ji's gang and Tie Zheng were at each other's throats, wearing each other down in fierce combat. They couldn't intervene and didn't want to intervene, so they focused their gazes on each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo sensed the atmosphere was wrong. Gritting his teeth, he supported himself against the wall and stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He still preserved quite a few Profound Weapon Armors. At this moment, they floated around him, circling defensively. especially the bronze fan among them, which had the most deterrent effect. After the gazes of many cultivators who were eager to make a move touched the bronze fan, they clearly hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Seeing this scene, Cultivator Hao had a gleam of appreciation flash in his eyes: "This kid Ning Zhuo is quite good at acting! Abandoning the bronze shield directly showed great boldness. As expected of a figurehead meticulously cultivated by a major clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Among the cultivators of the Profound Armor Cave, only Cultivator Hao saw through this point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The others were all kept in the dark. One of them suddenly said: "Ning Zhuo is in danger!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Just as his voice fell, three people moved against Ning Zhuo together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo immediately controlled the Profound Weapon Armors, executing defense and counterattacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ban Ji and the others were fighting a bitter battle around Tie Zheng. Tie Zheng constantly whipped up a gold and iron storm, creating the momentum of one person surrounding several.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">His Blade Beast 'Sweeping Light' had shrunk back into a sphere and hung at his waist. As long as it didn't move out, it brought immense pressure to others at all times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">A large number of bronze weapons collided, chased, and slashed at each other in mid-air. Some weapons could spew forth sharp edges, sweeping across the battlefield. There were also weapons that could affect others' emotions and spirits; this was the seventh bronze artifact, and the number of such items in the whole venue could be counted on one hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">One cultivator fought to a heated state; his flesh expanded, and his height increased. He tore open his upper garment, transforming into a muscular giant, brandishing a bronze axe and cleaving everywhere, severing stalagmites one by one, sending crushed rocks shooting out like shrapnel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Another cultivator moved like a ghost, the long spear in his hand stabbing repeatedly. The spear shot out like lightning, instantly piercing a cultivator's body and ruthlessly eliminating the opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">There was also a cultivator hiding in the shadows, occasionally throwing out a hook and line to snare a cultivator in the midst of fierce battle, dragging them directly into the darkness and eliminating them silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Those who could persist until now naturally included many experts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo had already successfully taken out two cultivators through "difficult" counterattacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Seeing that Ning Zhuo still had spare strength, the other cultivators gave up one after another, dealing with targets that were easier to handle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The Profound Weapon Armors were not durable in prolonged combat. With the battle intensity this high, a situation where weapons were insufficient would soon arise. The more weapons one had, the stronger one's strength, and the more one could persist to the end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ban Ji was forced into a corner by the gold and iron storm. With a roar, he fully urged his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He cultivated the Greedy Mechanism Demon Heart Art, and his divine sense possessed unique attack power, which Ning Zhuo had experienced before. Attacking with full force now to oppress Tie Zheng, he immediately caused Tie Zheng's offensive to slow, revealing a flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">One of the cultivators besieging Tie Zheng, short and stout with muscles bulging on his arms, held a handle with both hands and swung an eight-edged bronze mace, sweeping heavily toward Tie Zheng's left waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Tie Zheng erected a bronze long staff to block the bronze mace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">But in the next moment, the bronze long staff, bent in the middle, reached the standard of being damaged and was seized by the Profound Armor Cave's Grand Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Tie Zheng immediately frowned tightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He hadn't expected that apart from Ban Ji, this wave of opponents cooperated tacitly with each other and mastered combined attack tactics, making them extremely difficult to deal with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Tie Zheng fought fiercely for a while. Not only did he gain nothing, but he also lost a bronze staff from his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"In that case..." Tie Zheng drew a kitchen knife from his bosom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The knife came out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">There was no display of sharpness, nor was there brilliant light or strange colors. Only a condensed dark shadow flashed through the field of vision of Ban Ji's group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">At the same time, an artistic conception that was upright, hard, and fierce - one that could sever all obstacles and crush all hardness regardless of what lay ahead - was conveyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Before the bronze mace could be taken away, it was swept by the dark shadow and snapped into two pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">A rapier attacked; Tie Zheng gently wiped against it. The rapier was immediately shaved off, and the broken blade spun and flew out, nailing into the distant cave wall with a duo sound!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Qiang qiang qiang...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">After a series of metallic explosions, several Profound Weapon Armors were severed by the kitchen knife.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">This was the seventh kitchen knife Tie Zheng had harvested, containing the martial logic of Intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Tie Zheng's kitchen knife pressed forward with indomitable will!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The cultivators encircling him were all wounded and retreated in panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The encirclement collapsed, and they were immediately submerged by Tie Zheng's gold and iron storm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">In the time of a few breaths, this group of people was miserably eliminated. Only Ban Ji remained alone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Qiang qiang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Peng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ban Ji looked like a torn sack as he was ruthlessly chopped away, scattering a rain of blood in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Then, he heavily smashed into a massive stalactite and slid limply to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">His arms were twisted, his face was like gold paper, and his aura was weak to the extreme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">He stared dead at Tie Zheng, his gaze carrying intense unwillingness and resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">But it was useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">In the next moment, he was also teleported away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Ban Ji was eliminated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Tie Zheng also paid a huge price; his clothes were already dyed red with his blood, and his wounds were not few. The outburst just now had exhausted him physically and mentally. To activate the intent contained within martial arts, the consumption was not just physical stamina.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Only you few are left." Tie Zheng looked around and found that besides him, only four people remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Zhuo was exactly one of them. He spoke up at this moment: "Fellow Daoist Tie Zheng, although we will not be your match, we are still willing to give it a shot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"It won't be easy for you to retain nine pieces of Profound Weapon Armor in the end."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Tie Zheng was slightly stunned. Reminded by Ning Zhuo, he quickly scanned the whole venue and found that there were only twenty-three pieces of Profound Weapon Armor left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">There would be another round of fierce fighting next; to save nine pieces was indeed quite difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Tie Zheng huffed coldly, carrying a touch of arrogance: "Those of my generation who cultivate the Martial Path naturally rise to face difficulties. You all come at once."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Tie Zheng was the most dominant person present. Relying on the bronze kitchen knife and his own profound martial arts attainments, he had directly eliminated Ban Ji's gang, displaying his sharpness fully. Facing such a powerhouse, Ning Zhuo and the others naturally had to join forces to resist him together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">In fact, before Ning Zhuo even spoke, the other three actively transmitted thoughts via divine sense, expressing an invitation to ally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Ning Zhuo naturally agreed, going with the flow.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
