<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 519: Ginseng Dragon Whisker</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The main force camp of the Two Note Nations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Three Generals Camp, the Red Flower Camp, the White Jade Camp… every army was assigned to its respective camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Agonized cries came from all the camps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The soldiers were all performing the same spell to dispel the Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique from their bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique was a demonic art —one that sought quick gains but brought endless later troubles —and with no enemy troops present at the moment, it was the best time to dispel this demonic art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">At this time, the quartermaster aptly provided spirit liquid and pills. The former was used to soak the cultivators, greatly loosening the connection between their flesh and armor. The pills were categorized into seven types, and when taken as a complete set, they greatly increased the success rate of dispelling this demonic art, reduced the pain of the cultivators, and preserved their combat strength as much as possible afterwards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">If one did not use the pills, not only would the dispelling likely fail, but even if it succeeded, one would fall into a prolonged period of weakness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This was clearly something the soldiers were unwilling to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This grand battle had already been won, and although the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King still lived, it was clear that he had been defeated —and his injuries were surely even more severe than those of Du Tiechuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Everyone knew that in the coming period, it was an excellent opportunity for the various armies to use this camp as a center, launching attacks everywhere to seize battle merits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Everyone, having paid such a great price and taken unparalleled risks to come this far, now saw themselves on the verge of reaping a wealth of battle merits, and it was very likely that afterwards they would triumph and be granted wives and offspring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">At this time, no one would skimp on these expenses, for doing so would leave them weak for a long time, their combat strength would decline, and they would earn fewer battle merits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Therefore, even though the spirit liquid and pills were expensive, the vast majority of the soldiers bought them with their noses pinched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Under the leadership of Zhang Hei, batches of cultivators were safeguarded as they soaked in the spirit liquid and took the pills, continuously dispelling the armor that had grown on their flesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The costs of these spirit liquids and pills naturally came from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Liu Er and Guan Hong, on the other hand, secluded themselves in their respective residences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">This time, having participated in the “Iron Flow Leveling the Plains” military strategy, they all benefited greatly, were deeply moved, and learned a lot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Therefore, taking advantage of this time for recuperation, they immediately went into seclusion to review and reflect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo was no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">However, his cultivation of the art of warfare was far inferior to that of cultivators such as Liu, Guan, Zhang, Mu, and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After continuous midnight meditation for an entire day and a half, Ning Zhuo not only gained a deeper understanding of the “Iron Flow Leveling the Plains” strategy but also a deeper comprehension of the Hero's Return Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The progress in the latter was clearly more helpful to Ning Zhuo than that in the former. Sun Lingtong was the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Although he was confined within the Mechanical Dragon, he was still considered a partial participant. With his extraordinary insight, he also gained a lot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">However, the extent of his gains was far inferior to that of someone like Ning Zhuo, who experienced it firsthand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, officially ending this meditation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Fighting is such a fun thing,” Sun Lingtong said excitedly and with regret. “Had I known this earlier, I would have joined the army too!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo, however, felt the opposite: “It was terrifying; our main force had lost over two thousand men.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“The Iron Flow Leveling the Plains strategy, though formidable, had pushed all the way forward, advancing with a crushing momentum right into the enemy’s main base.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“But as a participant, I fought with boundless heroism, unafraid of death. Now, in hindsight, I felt utterly insignificant and powerless, and was very frightened.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“After all, I was just one among thousands of soldiers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“The only reason I survived was that I was lucky —the dragon breath of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King just happened not to blow on me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After a pause, Ning Zhuo lowered his head to look at his Mechanism Ring and said, “Even if the ring could alert me, under those circumstances I was utterly unable to change locations at will while in the state of the Iron Flow Leveling the Plains.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“So, even if the Mechanism Ring alerted me, it would have been of no use!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Sun Lingtong grunted and said, “That was to be expected!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Little Zhuo, just think about it —we are merely Foundation-Establishment stage cultivators, nothing more than minor practitioners.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Compared to beings of the Soul Formation level, we are nothing more than ants.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“But with the aid of military strategy, national strength, and so on, we could gather together and collectively produce combat power at the Soul Formation level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Achieving even this was already rare enough. To also ensure one’s life and safety —don’t you think that requirement is too high?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo fell silent for a moment, clenching his fists, and said, “In any case, after this battle, I have decided to take care of myself and participate less in wars that far exceed my abilities.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“I should work on enhancing my cultivation more!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong immediately agreed with this idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Halt, this Ginseng Dragon Whisker belongs to our army!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Clearly, it was killed by my army, but your side’s cultivators are so despicable, snatching it while our army was exhausted!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The two Golden Core-level generals argued loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Hmph, your men suffered significant losses and had already retreated from the battlefield; only then did our army make a move.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“According to you, if you were to stroll around the battlefield, engaging in a fight for each Ginseng Dragon Whisker and then retreat, wouldn’t all those Ginseng Dragon Whiskers belong to you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The volume of their dispute grew louder, attracting the attention of many.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Eventually, they were both summoned by a cultivator with orders and called into the Commander's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The soldiers of the Three Generals Camp grew a bit restless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The grand battle had ended, and the victors were, of course, the side of the Two Note Nations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">However, previously the main forces of the army had been busy constructing camps, laying out defensive measures, allowing the troops to catch their breath, and dispelling the Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique, so they did not have much energy to clean up the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Yet, what was left behind on the battlefield was a huge fortune!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Dragon King’s Ginseng Dragon Whiskers, dragon blood, and so on that were severed in battle were all precious materials! Although the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King himself was of the Soul Formation level only in his main body, the Ginseng Dragon Whiskers that could be left behind on the battlefield were, at the very least, Golden Core level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">And the sword techniques, military strategies, and so forth unleashed by Du Tiechuan also left profound imprints on the battlefield. Even if they were merely traces, one could glean the secrets of his cultivation from them, providing much inspiration to those with keen insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Now, most of the soldiers were still recuperating, their bodies weak, and their combat strength in a low ebb.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“But the Golden Core-level generals were not included in this, and could leave the camp first to scour the battlefield!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo quickly discerned the current situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The military order —clean up the battlefield!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Soon, after resolving the dispute between the two Golden Core generals, a military order was issued to the entire army from the Commander's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The content of the order was very simple: battle merits would be awarded according to the amount of plunder retrieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">All plunder belonged to the Two Note Nations, and no soldier was allowed to keep any for themselves; if discovered, military law would be applied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After Ning Zhuo read the relevant exchange rules, his heart skipped a beat with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“According to the military order, at the present time, all my battle merits could be exchanged for corresponding military supplies.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Even if the supplies did not contain what was needed, they could be immediately reported; then, the kings of the Two Note Nations would regularly organize transport of the troops to deliver the rewards.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">That afternoon, Ning Zhuo, along with Liu Er and Zhang Hei, left the main force camp and entered the previous battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The battlefield was vast; even the nearest mountain peaks were over a dozen li away. Moreover, the mountains in proximity were almost all damaged —some were broken in half, some had their summits smashed against other mountains, and some were reduced to nothing but a foothill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Countless fragments of rock of all sizes covered almost the entire battlefield, intermingled with a massive amount of broken grass and wood, as well as the remains of animals and cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After so many days had passed, these corpses had already begun to decay and emit a foul odor, and the entire battlefield was enveloped in a faint stench of death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">However, as long as the mountain wind blew, it would disperse the stench, allowing the cultivators entering the area to breathe in fresh air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The battlefield was not only composed of such terrain; there was also a vast area adjacent to the body of the Dragon King’s Giant Wooden Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The soil in this area was all a yellowish-brown color; although it was not even, compared to the rubble elsewhere, here the exposed ground was fertile yellow earth, and there were also numerous pits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">As for the Dragon King’s Giant Wooden Mountain, its body had suffered from the ravages of the previous grand battle, leaving only sixty percent remaining. That remaining sixty percent was still shrouded in divine light, which provided protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Liu Er and the other Golden Core cultivators kept a cautious distance. Who knew if the remnants of the Dragon King’s Giant Wooden Mountain might spawn another army?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Of course, as long as the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King did not appear, the overall situation here would remain unchanged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo, Liu Er, and Zhang Hei traversed the battlefield, and soon they saw a Ginseng Dragon Whisker rooted in the rubble, resembling a large, earth-colored python, listlessly sprawled on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">However, once it sensed the aura of Ning Zhuo and the others, it immediately sprang up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Its entire body stood upright, reaching a height of six zhang, its aura vigorous, at the Golden Core level, yet still retaining the divine charm of the Soul Formation level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Liu Er was the first to strike, wielding the Xuanhuang Sword and employing military strategy to empower himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He actively advanced and then consecutively cast two spells, both of which served to enhance his defensive prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Bang, bang, bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Ginseng Dragon Whisker pummeled Liu Er, emitting a series of dull thuds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Liu Er was enveloped in a halo of yellow light, his defense strong, and before long he was beaten into the rubble pile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">While defending, Liu Er simultaneously employed offensive techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Moments later, panting heavily and with a trace of fatigue, he returned to the side of Zhang Hei and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He had gauged the nature of the Ginseng Dragon Whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">This Ginseng Dragon Whisker was much longer than what appeared before them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Most of its body was interwoven within the rubble, and then rooted into the soil, absorbing nutrients to sustain its existence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Ginseng Dragon Whisker itself did not possess many offensive techniques; its actions mainly consisted of pounding, sweeping, and coiling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">But each of its strikes was immensely forceful and powerful, and its instinctive reactions were extremely sharp, making it difficult for even a body cultivator like Liu Er to get close.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Most crucially was the recovery ability of the Ginseng Dragon Whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Its recovery ability was extraordinarily strong; many of the injuries inflicted by Liu Er would heal completely within a few breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“To behead and harvest a Ginseng Dragon Whisker like this is not easy at all,” Liu Er remarked with heartfelt emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Zhang Hei, rubbing his fists together, said, “Whatever, let’s just do it first and worry about it later.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Impatient by nature, he immediately brandished his Black Snake Spear, charging forward to engage the Ginseng Dragon Whisker in combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He possessed the innate talent of the Frenzied Python Tendon and had also practiced the Black Waves of Turbulence technique; the combination of these two meant that the longer he fought continuously, the more ferocious his strength became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">For a time, the Ginseng Dragon Whisker and Zhang Hei’s Black Snake Spear clashed continuously, locked in a fierce stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In Liu Er’s eyes, reflecting the battle, he thought, “At this rate, even if third brother won and beheaded the Ginseng Dragon Whisker, it would still consume a great deal. The consumption here was not just Zhang Hei’s spiritual power, physical strength, or the durability of his weapon, but also the Ginseng Dragon Whisker itself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The three of them had come this time to clean up the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">But if the fierce battle continued like this, even if they eventually captured the Ginseng Dragon Whisker, it would have expended a large amount of its underlying energy due to the intense fighting, causing its quality to drop significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“In this situation, it all depends on you, Advisor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Liu Er smiled slightly and looked at Ning Zhuo, “You must have a way, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Although Ning Zhuo was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, his combat strength far surpassed that of most Golden Core cultivators, which had long earned Liu Er’s equal treatment towards him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Since they had met, Ning Zhuo had always delivered astonishing performances, which filled Liu Er with utmost confidence in him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo had been using his divine sense to observe the Ginseng Dragon Whisker, and during that time he also employed some spells for detection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“Hmm…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“I’ll give it a try first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo cast a Metal Element spell, penetrating deep into the rubble pile to cut the lower part of the Ginseng Dragon Whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Metal overcomes wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">However, Ning Zhuo’s Metal Element spell was only at the Foundation Establishment level, whereas the Ginseng Dragon Whisker before him was of Golden Core level and even carried a trace of the Soul Formation aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">This resulted in the Metal Element spell only causing some superficial abrasions on its surface, which healed completely after a single breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo remained calm; he was merely conducting an experiment with his spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Next, he consecutively cast nearly ten spells, covering the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Liu Er, witnessing this from the side, was secretly astonished and exclaimed in praise, “Advisor, is it that your esteemed family is most adept in the Five Elements spells? The spells you cast, I had scarcely ever seen before. This makes me curious: just how many Five Elements spells do you command?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and did not reveal the truth about the spells he had spontaneously created; he simply replied that Liu Er was flattering him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Liu Er shook his head and sighed, “Advisor, you are too modest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Even as they exchanged words, Ning Zhuo did not cease his actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">“It worked.” Moments later, he halted and revealed a smile filled with accomplishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He then consecutively cast three spells —namely, the Fire Element, Metal Element, and Earth Element spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">After the spells were alternately cast, the Ginseng Dragon Whisker began to shake violently, its movements became rigid, and its combat strength plummeted significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Liu Er’s pupils contracted, and his heart was struck as he thought, “Clearly, these were merely three Foundation Establishment-level spells, yet they had such a restrictive effect on a Golden Core-level Ginseng Dragon Whisker!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“Ning Zhuo…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Liu Er’s face was filled with caution, and in his eyes reflected the image of Ning Zhuo’s white-robed, big-headed youthful appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">He firmly thought to himself, “Given time, Ning Zhuo will undoubtedly shine brilliantly! His mastery of the Five Elements spells alone ensures his boundless future.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">After being subdued, the Ginseng Dragon Whisker was no longer as fierce and valiant as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">In the end, Zhang Hei swung his spear and cleaved it down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Liu Er seized the opportunity to strike, casting a spell to seal the Ginseng Dragon Whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">“How much is the market price for such a piece of treasure?” Zhang Hei asked excitedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Liu Er was not very sure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo then stroked his chin and estimated, “Roughly around 300,000 mid-grade spirit stones.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Liu Er and Zhang Hei were momentarily taken aback, and then both became excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Liu Er, who had also been poor, exclaimed, “That many?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo nodded, “Mainly because it’s such a long one, with ample quantity. Moreover, bearing the name of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King at the Soul Formation level, if sold off to faraway places, it might fetch a premium.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">“However, to eradicate the remaining will within the Ginseng Dragon Whisker, it would cost a significant sum of money.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Liu Er’s excited expression softened slightly as he nodded gently, “Indeed. The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King was not only of the Soul Formation level, but also had followed the divine path. The will of a deity is often very stubborn and long-lasting.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Zhang Hei then clasped his wrists and sighed, “What a pity, we don’t get any share of these Ginseng Dragon Whiskers; they must all be handed in.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Liu Er consoled him, “Exchanging them for battle merits, and then using those merits to obtain military supplies —that suits us better.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Zhang Hei shook his head, “If they are used to exchange for battle merits, they would surely be at the lowest market price. I, Old Zhang, know that without even thinking about it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Ning Zhuo’s expression shifted slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Liu Er looked at Ning Zhuo, “Advisor, according to our previous agreement, 30% of the battlefield earnings of the Three Generals Camp are yours. And this time, battle merits can also be traded among us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">“We are ashamed; only now are we able to repay you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Ning Zhuo smiled and waved his hand, “General, there is no need to worry too much; you know me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Liu Er laughed heartily, “Meeting an advisor like you is one of the good fortunes in life.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Zhang Hei also laughed, saying, “I feel the same way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">For a moment, the atmosphere became light and cheerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Ning Zhuo, along with Liu and Zhang, then chopped off another two Ginseng Dragon Whiskers, and it was already noon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">After carefully teaching Liu and Zhang the several spells he had developed, Ning Zhuo informed them that he would go off on a solo reconnaissance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Given Ning Zhuo’s lofty status within the Three Generals Camp, Zhang Hei had no objections, and Liu Er cautioned Ning Zhuo to be extra careful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Entering the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingtong impatiently said, “Quick, it’s time for the Old Stone Monster to make its appearance!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
