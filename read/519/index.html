<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 519: Ginseng Dragon Whisker</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The main force camp of the Twin Rivers Nations.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp, the Red Flower Camp, the White Jade Camp… every army was assigned to its respective camp.<br/>
<br/>
Agonized cries came from all the camps.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers were all performing the same spell to dispel the Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique from their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
The Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique was a demonic art —one that sought quick gains but brought endless later troubles —and with no enemy troops present at the moment, it was the best time to dispel this demonic art.<br/>
<br/>
At this time, the quartermaster aptly provided spirit liquid and pills. The former was used to soak the cultivators, greatly loosening the connection between their flesh and armor. The pills were categorized into seven types, and when taken as a complete set, they greatly increased the success rate of dispelling this demonic art, reduced the pain of the cultivators, and preserved their combat strength as much as possible afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
If one did not use the pills, not only would the dispelling likely fail, but even if it succeeded, one would fall into a prolonged period of weakness.<br/>
<br/>
This was clearly something the soldiers were unwilling to see.<br/>
<br/>
This grand battle had already been won, and although the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King still lived, it was clear that he had been defeated —and his injuries were surely even more severe than those of Du Tiechuan.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone knew that in the coming period, it was an excellent opportunity for the various armies to use this camp as a center, launching attacks everywhere to seize battle merits.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone, having paid such a great price and taken unparalleled risks to come this far, now saw themselves on the verge of reaping a wealth of battle merits, and it was very likely that afterwards they would triumph and be granted wives and offspring.<br/>
<br/>
At this time, no one would skimp on these expenses, for doing so would leave them weak for a long time, their combat strength would decline, and they would earn fewer battle merits.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, even though the spirit liquid and pills were expensive, the vast majority of the soldiers bought them with their noses pinched.<br/>
<br/>
Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Under the leadership of Zhang Hei, batches of cultivators were safeguarded as they soaked in the spirit liquid and took the pills, continuously dispelling the armor that had grown on their flesh.<br/>
<br/>
The costs of these spirit liquids and pills naturally came from Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and Guan Hong, on the other hand, secluded themselves in their respective residences.<br/>
<br/>
This time, having participated in the “Iron Flow Leveling the Plains” military strategy, they all benefited greatly, were deeply moved, and learned a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, taking advantage of this time for recuperation, they immediately went into seclusion to review and reflect.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was no exception.<br/>
<br/>
However, his cultivation of the art of warfare was far inferior to that of cultivators such as Liu, Guan, Zhang, Mu, and others.<br/>
<br/>
After continuous midnight meditation for an entire day and a half, Ning Zhuo not only gained a deeper understanding of the “Iron Flow Leveling the Plains” strategy but also a deeper comprehension of the Warrior’s Return Technique.<br/>
<br/>
The progress in the latter was clearly more helpful to Ning Zhuo than that in the former. Sun Lingtong was the same.<br/>
<br/>
Although he was confined within the Mechanical Dragon, he was still considered a partial participant. With his extraordinary insight, he also gained a lot.<br/>
<br/>
However, the extent of his gains was far inferior to that of someone like Ning Zhuo, who experienced it firsthand.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, officially ending this meditation.<br/>
<br/>
“Fighting is such a fun thing,” Sun Lingtong said excitedly and with regret. “Had I known this earlier, I would have joined the army too!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, felt the opposite: “It was terrifying; our main force had lost over two thousand men.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Iron Flow Leveling the Plains strategy, though formidable, had pushed all the way forward, advancing with a crushing momentum right into the enemy’s main base.”<br/>
<br/>
“But as a participant, I fought with boundless heroism, unafraid of death. Now, in hindsight, I felt utterly insignificant and powerless, and was very frightened.”<br/>
<br/>
“After all, I was just one among thousands of soldiers.”<br/>
<br/>
“The only reason I survived was that I was lucky —the dragon breath of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King just happened not to blow on me.”<br/>
<br/>
After a pause, Ning Zhuo lowered his head to look at his Mechanism Ring and said, “Even if the ring could alert me, under those circumstances I was utterly unable to change locations at will while in the state of the Iron Flow Leveling the Plains.”<br/>
<br/>
“So, even if the Mechanism Ring alerted me, it would have been of no use!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong grunted and said, “That was to be expected!”<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, just think about it —we are merely Foundation-Establishment stage cultivators, nothing more than minor practitioners.”<br/>
<br/>
“Compared to beings of the Soul Formation level, we are nothing more than ants.”<br/>
<br/>
“But with the aid of military strategy, national strength, and so on, we could gather together and collectively produce combat power at the Soul Formation level.”<br/>
<br/>
“Achieving even this was already rare enough. To also ensure one’s life and safety —don’t you think that requirement is too high?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo fell silent for a moment, clenching his fists, and said, “In any case, after this battle, I have decided to take care of myself and participate less in wars that far exceed my abilities.”<br/>
<br/>
“I should work on enhancing my cultivation more!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong immediately agreed with this idea.<br/>
<br/>
The next day.<br/>
<br/>
“Halt, this Ginseng Dragon Whisker belongs to our army!”<br/>
<br/>
“Clearly, it was killed by my army, but your side’s cultivators are so despicable, snatching it while our army was exhausted!”<br/>
<br/>
The two Golden Core-level generals argued loudly.<br/>
<br/>
“Hmph, your men suffered significant losses and had already retreated from the battlefield; only then did our army make a move.”<br/>
<br/>
“According to you, if you were to stroll around the battlefield, engaging in a fight for each Ginseng Dragon Whisker and then retreat, wouldn’t all those Ginseng Dragon Whiskers belong to you?”<br/>
<br/>
The volume of their dispute grew louder, attracting the attention of many.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, they were both summoned by a cultivator with orders and called into the Commander's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers of the Three Generals Camp grew a bit restless.<br/>
<br/>
The grand battle had ended, and the victors were, of course, the side of the Twin Rivers Nations.<br/>
<br/>
However, previously the main forces of the army had been busy constructing camps, laying out defensive measures, allowing the troops to catch their breath, and dispelling the Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique, so they did not have much energy to clean up the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, what was left behind on the battlefield was a huge fortune!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon King’s Ginseng Dragon Whiskers, dragon blood, and so on that were severed in battle were all precious materials! Although the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King himself was of the Soul Formation level only in his main body, the Ginseng Dragon Whiskers that could be left behind on the battlefield were, at the very least, Golden Core level!<br/>
<br/>
And the sword techniques, military strategies, and so forth unleashed by Du Tiechuan also left profound imprints on the battlefield. Even if they were merely traces, one could glean the secrets of his cultivation from them, providing much inspiration to those with keen insight.<br/>
<br/>
“Now, most of the soldiers were still recuperating, their bodies weak, and their combat strength in a low ebb.”<br/>
<br/>
“But the Golden Core-level generals were not included in this, and could leave the camp first to scour the battlefield!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly discerned the current situation.<br/>
<br/>
The military order —clean up the battlefield!<br/>
<br/>
Soon, after resolving the dispute between the two Golden Core generals, a military order was issued to the entire army from the Commander's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
The content of the order was very simple: battle merits would be awarded according to the amount of plunder retrieved.<br/>
<br/>
All plunder belonged to the Twin Rivers Nations, and no soldier was allowed to keep any for themselves; if discovered, military law would be applied.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo read the relevant exchange rules, his heart skipped a beat with excitement.<br/>
<br/>
“According to the military order, at the present time, all my battle merits could be exchanged for corresponding military supplies.”<br/>
<br/>
“Even if the supplies did not contain what was needed, they could be immediately reported; then, the kings of the Twin Rivers Nations would regularly organize transport of the troops to deliver the rewards.”<br/>
<br/>
That afternoon, Ning Zhuo, along with Liu Er and Zhang Hei, left the main force camp and entered the previous battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The battlefield was vast; even the nearest mountain peaks were over a dozen li away. Moreover, the mountains in proximity were almost all damaged —some were broken in half, some had their summits smashed against other mountains, and some were reduced to nothing but a foothill.<br/>
<br/>
Countless fragments of rock of all sizes covered almost the entire battlefield, intermingled with a massive amount of broken grass and wood, as well as the remains of animals and cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
After so many days had passed, these corpses had already begun to decay and emit a foul odor, and the entire battlefield was enveloped in a faint stench of death.<br/>
<br/>
However, as long as the mountain wind blew, it would disperse the stench, allowing the cultivators entering the area to breathe in fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
The battlefield was not only composed of such terrain; there was also a vast area adjacent to the body of the Dragon King’s Giant Wooden Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The soil in this area was all a yellowish-brown color; although it was not even, compared to the rubble elsewhere, here the exposed ground was fertile yellow earth, and there were also numerous pits.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Dragon King’s Giant Wooden Mountain, its body had suffered from the ravages of the previous grand battle, leaving only sixty percent remaining. That remaining sixty percent was still shrouded in divine light, which provided protection.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and the other Golden Core cultivators kept a cautious distance. Who knew if the remnants of the Dragon King’s Giant Wooden Mountain might spawn another army?<br/>
<br/>
Of course, as long as the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King did not appear, the overall situation here would remain unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, Liu Er, and Zhang Hei traversed the battlefield, and soon they saw a Ginseng Dragon Whisker rooted in the rubble, resembling a large, earth-colored python, listlessly sprawled on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
However, once it sensed the aura of Ning Zhuo and the others, it immediately sprang up.<br/>
<br/>
Its entire body stood upright, reaching a height of six zhang, its aura vigorous, at the Golden Core level, yet still retaining the divine charm of the Soul Formation level.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was the first to strike, wielding the Xuanhuang Sword and employing military strategy to empower himself.<br/>
<br/>
He actively advanced and then consecutively cast two spells, both of which served to enhance his defensive prowess.<br/>
<br/>
Bang, bang, bang.<br/>
<br/>
The Ginseng Dragon Whisker pummeled Liu Er, emitting a series of dull thuds.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was enveloped in a halo of yellow light, his defense strong, and before long he was beaten into the rubble pile.<br/>
<br/>
While defending, Liu Er simultaneously employed offensive techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, panting heavily and with a trace of fatigue, he returned to the side of Zhang Hei and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
He had gauged the nature of the Ginseng Dragon Whisker.<br/>
<br/>
This Ginseng Dragon Whisker was much longer than what appeared before them.<br/>
<br/>
Most of its body was interwoven within the rubble, and then rooted into the soil, absorbing nutrients to sustain its existence.<br/>
<br/>
The Ginseng Dragon Whisker itself did not possess many offensive techniques; its actions mainly consisted of pounding, sweeping, and coiling.<br/>
<br/>
But each of its strikes was immensely forceful and powerful, and its instinctive reactions were extremely sharp, making it difficult for even a body cultivator like Liu Er to get close.<br/>
<br/>
Most crucially was the recovery ability of the Ginseng Dragon Whisker.<br/>
<br/>
Its recovery ability was extraordinarily strong; many of the injuries inflicted by Liu Er would heal completely within a few breaths.<br/>
<br/>
“To behead and harvest a Ginseng Dragon Whisker like this is not easy at all,” Liu Er remarked with heartfelt emotion.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei, rubbing his fists together, said, “Whatever, let’s just do it first and worry about it later.”<br/>
<br/>
Impatient by nature, he immediately brandished his Black Snake Spear, charging forward to engage the Ginseng Dragon Whisker in combat.<br/>
<br/>
He possessed the innate talent of the Frenzied Python Tendon and had also practiced the Black Waves of Turbulence technique; the combination of these two meant that the longer he fought continuously, the more ferocious his strength became.<br/>
<br/>
For a time, the Ginseng Dragon Whisker and Zhang Hei’s Black Snake Spear clashed continuously, locked in a fierce stalemate.<br/>
<br/>
In Liu Er’s eyes, reflecting the battle, he thought, “At this rate, even if third brother won and beheaded the Ginseng Dragon Whisker, it would still consume a great deal. The consumption here was not just Zhang Hei’s spiritual power, physical strength, or the durability of his weapon, but also the Ginseng Dragon Whisker itself.”<br/>
<br/>
The three of them had come this time to clean up the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
But if the fierce battle continued like this, even if they eventually captured the Ginseng Dragon Whisker, it would have expended a large amount of its underlying energy due to the intense fighting, causing its quality to drop significantly.<br/>
<br/>
“In this situation, it all depends on you, Advisor.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er smiled slightly and looked at Ning Zhuo, “You must have a way, right?”<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, his combat strength far surpassed that of most Golden Core cultivators, which had long earned Liu Er’s equal treatment towards him.<br/>
<br/>
Since they had met, Ning Zhuo had always delivered astonishing performances, which filled Liu Er with utmost confidence in him!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had been using his divine sense to observe the Ginseng Dragon Whisker, and during that time he also employed some spells for detection.<br/>
<br/>
“Hmm…”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll give it a try first.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cast a Metal Element spell, penetrating deep into the rubble pile to cut the lower part of the Ginseng Dragon Whisker.<br/>
<br/>
Metal overcomes wood.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo’s Metal Element spell was only at the Foundation Establishment level, whereas the Ginseng Dragon Whisker before him was of Golden Core level and even carried a trace of the Soul Formation aura.<br/>
<br/>
This resulted in the Metal Element spell only causing some superficial abrasions on its surface, which healed completely after a single breath.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained calm; he was merely conducting an experiment with his spell.<br/>
<br/>
Next, he consecutively cast nearly ten spells, covering the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, witnessing this from the side, was secretly astonished and exclaimed in praise, “Advisor, is it that your esteemed family is most adept in the Five Elements spells? The spells you cast, I had scarcely ever seen before. This makes me curious: just how many Five Elements spells do you command?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and did not reveal the truth about the spells he had spontaneously created; he simply replied that Liu Er was flattering him.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er shook his head and sighed, “Advisor, you are too modest.”<br/>
<br/>
Even as they exchanged words, Ning Zhuo did not cease his actions.<br/>
<br/>
“It worked.” Moments later, he halted and revealed a smile filled with accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
He then consecutively cast three spells —namely, the Fire Element, Metal Element, and Earth Element spells.<br/>
<br/>
After the spells were alternately cast, the Ginseng Dragon Whisker began to shake violently, its movements became rigid, and its combat strength plummeted significantly.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s pupils contracted, and his heart was struck as he thought, “Clearly, these were merely three Foundation Establishment-level spells, yet they had such a restrictive effect on a Golden Core-level Ginseng Dragon Whisker!”<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo…”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s face was filled with caution, and in his eyes reflected the image of Ning Zhuo’s white-robed, big-headed youthful appearance.<br/>
<br/>
He firmly thought to himself, “Given time, Ning Zhuo will undoubtedly shine brilliantly! His mastery of the Five Elements spells alone ensures his boundless future.”<br/>
<br/>
After being subdued, the Ginseng Dragon Whisker was no longer as fierce and valiant as before.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Zhang Hei swung his spear and cleaved it down.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er seized the opportunity to strike, casting a spell to seal the Ginseng Dragon Whisker.<br/>
<br/>
“How much is the market price for such a piece of treasure?” Zhang Hei asked excitedly.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was not very sure.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then stroked his chin and estimated, “Roughly around 300,000 mid-grade spirit stones.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and Zhang Hei were momentarily taken aback, and then both became excited.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, who had also been poor, exclaimed, “That many?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, “Mainly because it’s such a long one, with ample quantity. Moreover, bearing the name of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King at the Soul Formation level, if sold off to faraway places, it might fetch a premium.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, to eradicate the remaining will within the Ginseng Dragon Whisker, it would cost a significant sum of money.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s excited expression softened slightly as he nodded gently, “Indeed. The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King was not only of the Soul Formation level, but also had followed the divine path. The will of a deity is often very stubborn and long-lasting.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei then clasped his wrists and sighed, “What a pity, we don’t get any share of these Ginseng Dragon Whiskers; they must all be handed in.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er consoled him, “Exchanging them for battle merits, and then using those merits to obtain military supplies —that suits us better.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei shook his head, “If they are used to exchange for battle merits, they would surely be at the lowest market price. I, Old Zhang, know that without even thinking about it.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s expression shifted slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er looked at Ning Zhuo, “Advisor, according to our previous agreement, 30% of the battlefield earnings of the Three Generals Camp are yours. And this time, battle merits can also be traded among us.”<br/>
<br/>
“We are ashamed; only now are we able to repay you.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled and waved his hand, “General, there is no need to worry too much; you know me.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er laughed heartily, “Meeting an advisor like you is one of the good fortunes in life.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei also laughed, saying, “I feel the same way.”<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the atmosphere became light and cheerful.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, along with Liu and Zhang, then chopped off another two Ginseng Dragon Whiskers, and it was already noon.<br/>
<br/>
After carefully teaching Liu and Zhang the several spells he had developed, Ning Zhuo informed them that he would go off on a solo reconnaissance.<br/>
<br/>
Given Ning Zhuo’s lofty status within the Three Generals Camp, Zhang Hei had no objections, and Liu Er cautioned Ning Zhuo to be extra careful.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingtong impatiently said, “Quick, it’s time for the Old Stone Monster to make its appearance!”</div>
