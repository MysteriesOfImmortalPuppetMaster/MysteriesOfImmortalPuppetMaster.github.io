<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji let out a cold snort. “So you all are suspecting me now!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“My Golden Pupils can see through heaven and earth. How could mere flames block my gaze?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“I saw that the old ape had cultivated a profound demonic technique, but never used it. Instead, it risked its own life to protect its master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“This is true loyalty!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“How many of us humans could go to such lengths?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“I was moved by its loyalty, and couldn’t bear to let it die. That’s why I healed it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">At this point, Zhu Xuanji’s tone turned firm. “But it’s precisely because I healed it myself that I had the chance to not only look with my Golden Pupils but also probe it with my magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“I can say with complete certainty that aside from its serious injuries, there was nothing wrong with the old ape. There was absolutely no black shadow demonic cultivator hiding inside of it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The others fell silent again at Zhu Xuanji’s resolute words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">If that was true, there were no more doubts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The more likely explanation was that someone had secretly released the black shadow demonic cultivator ahead of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Fei Si’s brow gradually furrowed. He opened his mouth as if to speak, but closed it again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Zhou Clan old ancestor also frowned, but pressed on with his questioning. “Sir Zhu, forgive my boldness, but can you truly be certain there is no mistake?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Are there no spells or divine abilities in this world that can deceive both your Golden Pupils and your magical power?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Zhu Xuanji let out a cold laugh. “Now you’re just being unreasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Who can guarantee perfection?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“This world has countless geniuses and endless prodigies. There are an infinite number of spells, divine abilities, and magic treasures. How could I possibly know them all?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Let me tell you, my Golden Pupils innate talent is already almost at the level of a divine ability. In my ten-plus years with the Divine Investigation Bureau, I’ve only encountered three Golden Core cultivators who could resist my Golden Pupils’ insight. Below the Golden Core realm, no living thing has ever escaped my eyes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Once again, silence fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">However, seeking to completely rid himself of suspicion, Zhu Xuanji suggested, “Since some of you seem to still distrust me, let’s go find that old ape now. Everyone can examine it personally. How about that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“That makes sense!” Chi Dun nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Very well,” The Zhou Clan old ancestor agreed as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Fei Si, though, felt a chill in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He thought again of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">After the incident, Ning Zhuo had taken the initiative to suggest persuading Yuan Er to surrender and coercing or bribing him into killing the old ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Who knew how far things had progressed by now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The thought of Ning Zhuo still holding his order token made Fei Si even more anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">However, he kept a calm exterior. “I also have my doubts about this matter. Seeing it with my own eyes wouldn’t hurt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Here’s what we’ll do. Chi Dun, you stay here and continue leading the rest of the Golden Core cultivators in the search. There may be people hiding underground. We can’t let anyone slip away!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Fei Si then invited the Zhou Clan old ancestor and Zhu Xuanji to go with himself and investigate Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Chi Dun was displeased. “Why do I have to stay behind? You should be the one handling this!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Fei Si silenced him with one sentence. “Sir City Lord appointed me to oversee the Fire Persimmon Festival; are you saying you won’t follow my command?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Chi Dun snorted coldly but had no choice but to comply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The three Golden Core cultivators flew off together toward the Monkey Head Gang’s headquarters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Yuan Er was still kneeling by the bedside in a daze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Suddenly, the three Golden Core cultivators descended from the sky, crashing through the rooftop and towering over him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Yuan Er trembled in fright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Where’s your old ape?” Zhu Xuanji swept his divine sense through the rear courtyard, already noticing something off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Yuan Er’s face turned deathly pale. He burst into tears. “He’s dead. My Uncle Monkey is dead!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Xuanji’s eyes flared with golden light. His voice was sharp as he said, “I gave you a Late Autumn Life Preservation Pill. How did the old ape die?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Yuan Er was shaking like a leaf. Too scared to hide anything, he quickly stammered out the whole story.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">When Zhu Xuanji finished listening, his face turned pale with anger. He pointed at Yuan Er. “You ungrateful wretch!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Then he turned to Fei Si. “Very good! Fei Si, this is your doing? How clever of you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Fei Si was inwardly delighted. “I didn’t expect Ning Zhuo to move so fast. Well done!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He was in a good mood after regaining the upper hand. Narrowing his eyes, he said slowly, “Thank you for the compliment, Sir Zhu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“I’m only thinking of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“After all, using monkey pets to harvest fire persimmons is rather cruel. Three Schools Supreme Sage was full of benevolence; if he hadn’t left behind Lava Immortal Palace back then, Fire Persimmon Mountain wouldn’t be the paradise it is today.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“As members of the latter generation, we should fully embrace Three Schools Supreme Sage’s spirit, let these monkeys go, and switch entirely to mechanical constructs. That’s what we call compassion for all living beings. It’s a benevolent and merciful governing policy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Fei Si pretended not to hear the sarcasm in Zhu Xuanji’s voice and earnestly praised himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Zhu Xuanji was so angry his breathing turned rough, his pale face tinged with green.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Fei Si felt even more satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">This wasn’t just a matter of saving face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Righteous cultivators couldn’t fight as directly and bloodily as demonic cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">So these confrontations within the confines of the rules had become the measure of a cultivator’s strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Fame and profit were closely intertwined. Having a resounding reputation often led to real, tangible benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Being publicly forced by Zhu Xuanji to open the formation had shown Fei Si in a weak light. In the future, many would likely lean more toward Zhu Xuanji. This would undermine Fei Si’s authority and weaken his influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Going further, it would even diminish the influence of the City Lord Mansion and the current City Lord, Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">As a representative of the royal family and the Divine Investigation Bureau, Zhu Xuanji was already in a power struggle with Meng Kui’s faction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">If Fei Si didn’t strike back, or more precisely, didn’t strike back properly within the rules, Meng Kui would surely be disappointed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Now that he had won a round and balanced out the earlier negative impact, he could finally breathe easier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Zhou Clan old ancestor stood to the side with a frown. He was completely unwilling to get involved in the conflict between Fei Si and Zhu Xuanji. As a third party, it was still much too early for him to step in and take a side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He was more focused on solving the matter of the black shadow demonic cultivator, so he said, “Since the old ape has already been taken away, what are we still doing here?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Brother Fei, where is your messenger now?” The Zhou Clan old ancestor asked Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The immortal city grand formation greatly suppressed divine sense, but Fei Si had the necessary authority. He immediately borrowed the grand formation’s power to extend his divine sense and sensed the location of his order token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Follow me!” Fei Si took the lead and flew away from the Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Zhu Xuanji and the Zhou Clan old ancestor followed closely behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Three arcs of light crossed the sky and soon landed at the Flying Disk Workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhu Xuanji reached out and made a grabbing motion in the air. An invisible force immediately ripped off the rooftop, revealing Ning Zhuo and Chen Cha inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The old ape that the three Golden Core cultivators had been searching for was lying on the mechanical pedestal. Its essence blood had already been drained, and it was on the verge of being dismembered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Stop at once!” The Zhou Clan old ancestor shouted sharply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo and Chen Cha were shocked and hurriedly bowed in greeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The three Golden Core cultivators ignored them and released their divine sense, sweeping it fully over Yuan Dasheng’s corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">They found no trace of any demonic cultivator hidden within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“It did indeed cultivate a demonic technique, and to a decently high level as well,” the Zhou Clan old ancestor said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Zhu Xuanji once again confirmed the results of his earlier inspection. He glanced regretfully at the old ape’s corpse, then turned his gaze toward Ning Zhuo. “You little brat, you really have a silver tongue. Yuan Er was a fool to be so easily convinced by you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and said nervously, “Sir Zhu, please analyze things fairly. My cooperation with Yuan Er is beneficial for both of us. I want to make money, and Yuan Er wants to keep his position as gang leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“Please forgive my boldness – Sir, you acted with compassion and righteousness in saving the old ape. But was that really a good thing for it? Given its loyalty to its master, don’t you think it would rather die than become a burden?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Hmph, slick words and a sharp tongue!” Zhu Xuanji’s opinion of Ning Zhuo dropped rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Standing off to the side, Fei Si stroked his beard and was even more impressed with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The three Golden Core cultivators found nothing suspicious. Soon, they flew off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Fei Si led them back to Fire Persimmon Forest, but Zhu Xuanji came to a sudden stop mid-flight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">His brow furrowed deeply as he thought hard. “I keep getting the feeling that something isn’t right!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
