<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Apart from the ink rain and the deepening book pages, the previous thorny vines were still entangled around the arm of Qi Luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The vines were crimson throughout, as if painted with red lacquer, and their surfaces were covered in ferocious barbs. They wound their way forward, slowly climbing up the Qi Luck arm and tangling around the ring finger of the five fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">One loop, two loops, three loops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The vines transformed into a ring of thorns, tightly constricting the finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The sharp thorns pierced into the finger, just as before; there was not much change in the scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Seeing this, the Supreme Clan Elders of the Ban family made their assessment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"This calamity hasn't changed, but Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck has strengthened significantly, causing this disaster to be less threatening than before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"It matters not. As long as this calamity has not been dissolved, it has its uses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Correct! Once Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck falls, the calamity will surely trigger. When that happens, and our side strikes at the opportune moment, victory will be certain!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Ban family and Ban Ji were now bound together for better or worse. The Ban family’s Supreme Clan Elders were racking their brains over the matter of the Royal Mandate breaking the Human Tribulation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">As everyone exchanged words, the clouds amidst the Qi Luck arm began to rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The clouds were as white as snow and as light as catkins, yet they carried an indescribable pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">They gradually converged into a single entity, hovering above Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck arm. At first, it looked like magnificent jeweled palaces and jade towers, an immortal city, absolutely exquisite. The pavilions, terraces, flying eaves, and dougong brackets were all lifelike, as if a true Immortal City had descended into the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Then, the pavilions collapsed, the terraces crumbled, the eaves snapped, and the brackets shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The clouds sank, and the myriad ruins of the Immortal City rapidly twisted, transforming into a massive, plain white coffin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The coffin positioned the Qi Luck arm in its center. With a slow yet heavy posture, it gradually solidified, displaying a resolute stance of suppressing, sealing, and burying the Qi Luck arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Even as enemies, the Ban family’s Supreme Clan Elders felt an indescribable weight from this vision of Qi Luck!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"What kind of calamity is this? It wants to suppress Ning Zhuo to death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Ning Zhuo successively refused Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang, and recently swept through numerous formation minor trials, showing the bearing of a heaven's chosen. Yet there is such a calamity?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"There is no need for our clan's Royal Mandate to strike; Ning Zhuo is going to perish on his own."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"No. Before Ning Zhuo perishes on his own, Ban Ji must defeat him first to break the Royal Mandate Human Tribulation! Otherwise, once this Human Tribulation dissipates, it will inevitably transfer to someone else."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"From what we can see, although Ning Zhuo is strong, we already know a great deal about him. The only thing missing is his background and origins."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Is there an issue with his background? Is that what triggered the plain white coffin?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Seeing the others slacking slightly, one Supreme Clan Elder felt anxious. He raised his voice and whispered urgently, "Everyone, absolutely do not underestimate the Royal Mandate Human Tribulation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"There are layers of variables within this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Leaving aside the fact that if Ning Zhuo simply joins Zhong Dao or Tuoba Huang, it will certainly trigger outside aid and cause changes to the current Qi Luck vision."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Just look at the star cluster he is currently holding in his hand. We do not know its counterpart in reality."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"After he absorbs it, what kind of changes will occur to his Qi Luck?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The group fell into a silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Just then, a new layer of change emerged in Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">A strand of withered yellow aura appeared out of thin air, drifting toward the Qi Luck arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">A matching aura also seeped out from within the Qi Luck arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The two auras converged, turning into a cloud of withered yellow smoke that spread over the surface of the arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The withered yellow smoke fought for territory with the book pages and thorns. The skin and flesh on the Qi Luck arm withered rapidly, like falling leaves in autumn, about to drift away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Even the closing momentum of the surrounding plain white coffin was delayed by a fraction!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The group of Supreme Clan Elders looked at each other in dismay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"What is this thing now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Which side's calamity is this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"What exactly does Ning Zhuo do? How is he even more troublesome than our clan's Royal Mandate?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In the past, when the Ban family used the Clan Destiny Pivot Link, they could analyze a target with great accuracy. But with Ning Zhuo, unexpected situations kept arising.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The many Supreme Clan Elders discussed among themselves, but none could distinguish clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"There is an intent of decay within this; it feels no small matter to me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Did you notice? This isn't purely an external enemy. When the withered yellow aura approached the arm, a homologous aura seeped out from the arm itself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Yes, I saw it. This indicates that this calamity had already infiltrated and lurked by Ning Zhuo's side, or even inside his body!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">As the cultivators discussed, another mutation occurred with a heavy sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The withered yellow Qi Luck agitated a change in the Qi Luck arm - deep within the arm, a star began to shine brightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The star was dark red, not large - only the size of a fingernail - but it emitted a heart-palpitating light. Within the light, a sea of blood, demonic shadows, and baleful energy could be vaguely seen churning, as if it harbored a demonic domain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">A Demonic Path Star!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Ning Zhuo has three stars. What exactly is the origin of that withered yellow aura? It triggered the Demonic Path Luck Star on Ning Zhuo!" a Supreme Clan Elder cried out involuntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">For a moment, the Supreme Clan Elders present stared fixedly at the star within the arm, not saying a word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">That demonic energy had intended to erode his Qi Luck, but instead, it activated the Demonic Path potential within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The withered yellow smoke sensed Ning Zhuo's Luck Star. It paused slightly, then advanced instead of retreating, surging toward the Demonic Star even more frantically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">For a time, the smoke and the Demonic Star entangled, probed, and wrestled with each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The smoke wanted to erode the Demonic Star and assimilate it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Demonic Star wanted to devour the smoke to strengthen itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The two clashed fiercely within the Qi Luck arm. Every collision caused the arm to tremble violently. Book pages were shaken off, thorns were bounced away, and the cloud coffin shook slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Amidst the withered yellow smoke, the Demonic Star shone increasingly brighter. At the same time, two other Luck Stars slowly emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Mechanical Star, bronze in color, with faint phantoms of gears, chains, and wheels circulating within. It hung above the arm, steady as a bell, unmoving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Strange Path Star, grey-white in color, weird and unpredictable, seeming both there and not there, existing between reality and illusion. It floated to the left of the arm, flickering in and out of sight, as if it might dissipate at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The expressions of the Supreme Clan Elders were solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Demonic Star had been activated, and it seemed to have pulled along the Mechanism and Strange Path stars as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Ning Zhuo's current situation is extremely complex, burying immense danger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"If this continues, he will inevitably face a great upheaval soon!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Fortune and misfortune rely on one another; life and death coexist. Is the star cloud in his hand the key to resolving the current disaster?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The group of Supreme Clan Elders fell into discussion once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">They truly could not clearly distinguish Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The situation was too complicated- </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Whittled by book pages, wound by thorns, suppressed by a cloud coffin, eroded by demonic smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">And three stars gradually revealing themselves!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="139"/>
<paragraph index="141">Gongsun Yan paid a visit to Xiao Juxia once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Elder Xiao, this junior has come to disturb you again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Xiao Juxia took out a stack of Dao-Bearing Jade Pages, while Gongsun Yan presented a storage bag full of Spirit Stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Gongsun Yan swept his divine sense over them. possessing attainment in artifact refining, he immediately judged that the quality of these Dao-Bearing Jade Pages was also excellent. He couldn't help but rejoice: "Many thanks, Elder Xiao!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Just as he was about to propose continuing the transaction, he suddenly heard Xiao Juxia say, "This is the last batch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Gongsun Yan’s eyes were filled with astonishment: "The last batch? Elder Xiao, do you mean..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Xiao Juxia slowly sat back at the stone table, picked up his teacup, took a gentle sip, and looked calm: "It means exactly what it sounds like. After selling this batch, this old man will no longer refine Dao-Bearing Jade Pages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Gongsun Yan instantly became anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The task Ning Zhuo gave him was to acquire as many Dao-Bearing Jade Pages as possible. Gongsun Yan had visited many people, but only Xiao Juxia had such strength and was willing to refine and sell Dao-Bearing Jade Pages during the Flying Cloud Assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">If Xiao Juxia cut off the supply, Ning Zhuo's external purchasing channel would be severed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Gongsun Yan said urgently, "Elder Xiao, wh-why are you suddenly stopping? Have you encountered some difficulty? Or is someone making things hard for you? Speak up, this junior might be able to think of a way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Xiao Juxia waved his hand, interrupting him: "There is no difficulty, and no one is making things hard for this old man."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He put down the teacup, cast his gaze toward the few stalks of green bamboo in the corner of the courtyard, and spoke in a leisurely tone: "It's just that the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, which interests this old man, has appeared, and I am going to participate. My energy will be limited in the future, so naturally, I won't have time to refine these."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Gongsun Yan subconsciously pressed, "What kind of trial is it? Can this junior be of any help? Elder Xiao, please speak freely. Although this junior doesn't have great ability, running errands and inquiring about news is still doable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Xiao Juxia shook his head, his expression remaining calm: "It is inconvenient to reveal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Gongsun Yan's words stuck in his throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He understood what Xiao Juxia meant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">When cultivators participated in trials, the biggest taboo was leaking information beforehand. Once word got out, it would attract more experts to compete, adding variables, and one might even be targeted by others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Xiao Juxia was neither kin nor friend to him; why should he tell him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Gongsun Yan was silent for a moment, then spoke again, "Then... Elder Xiao, this junior can increase the price. You name a number. As long as this junior can afford it, I will absolutely not haggle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Hehehe, this old man is not short of money." Xiao Juxia smiled faintly. "Refining these Dao-Bearing Jade Pages was primarily because of interest. Secondly, I wanted to form a good karmic bond with your Young Master. Now that the interest has passed, naturally, I won't refine them anymore. It has nothing to do with money."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Gongsun Yan was completely out of words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He looked at the elder before him, a deep sense of powerlessness rising in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Finally, he sighed lightly and bowed with cupped fists: "I have disturbed Elder Xiao. This junior bids farewell."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="189"/>
<paragraph index="191">Blue Stone Cave Dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Gongsun Yan lowered his head: "Young Master, I handled the matter poorly..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo waved his hand, interrupting him: "It has nothing to do with you. Xiao Juxia is at the Golden Core completion stage. I’ve repeatedly bought his Dao-Bearing Jade Pages recently, and I suspect in my heart that he intentionally let me win back then, watching me take first place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"How could such a figure be easily moved by Spirit Stones?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"That you could achieve this much is partially luck, but it also shows you are excellent enough. There is no need to blame yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">After buying Dao-Bearing Jade Pages several times in a row, Ning Zhuo clearly discovered that the quality was better each time, fully displaying Xiao Juxia's artifact refining attainment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo's artifact refining realm had already reached the level of a Renowned Artisan, so he certainly possessed the vision and comprehension to see this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Seeing that Ning Zhuo did not blame him but instead comforted him, Gongsun Yan retreated respectfully, his admiration for Ning Zhuo growing even deeper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">At first, he had only joined Ning Zhuo because Ning Zhuo could solve the drawbacks of his innate talent. But afterwards, he followed Ning Zhuo through several artifact refining sessions, and Ning Zhuo's attainment made him sigh in admiration repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Gongsun Yan had almost personally witnessed Ning Zhuo's entire journey, from being unknown when he first entered the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main gate to his current height of fame. From the bottom of his heart, he felt Ning Zhuo had a boundless future. Therefore, he put his whole heart and effort into the orders Ning Zhuo issued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">After Gongsun Yan left, Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The change with Xiao Juxia was actually something Ning Zhuo had anticipated. Putting himself in the other's shoes, he wouldn't lock himself in a room to painstakingly refine Dao-Bearing Jade Pages just to sell for money during a critical moment like the Flying Cloud Assembly either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">With Xiao Juxia's artifact refining attainment, how could he lack money?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"I must have enough Dao-Bearing Jade Pages to completely return the Formation attainment to Boss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Now that Xiao Juxia has washed his hands of it, I can only make time to refine them myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo had no choice but to convey this bad news to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Sun Lingtong didn't care at all: "This isn't a big deal. You just keep using my Formation attainment. I'm not in a hurry over here; it’s fine, it’s fine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He had unwavering trust in Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Sun Lingtong added, "You should hurry up and refine the Luo Shu Page first. After I clean up Shuyu Studio, I want to go out for a stroll."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"The Myriad Manifestations Sect's Rising Cloud Minor Trial is very interesting. I want to take a good look at such excitement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Given Sun Lingtong's temperament, staying cooped up in Shuyu Studio for so many days was already an extremely rare occurrence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">It was entirely due to the heavy treasure that was the Luo Shu Page triggering his thieving nature, as well as his wish to help Ning Zhuo retrieve his mother's legacy, that allowed him to devote himself fully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Now that the Luo Shu Page was in hand, Sun Lingtong could no longer endure the loneliness and wanted to wander around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Of course, his identity would not pass the Myriad Manifestations Sect's verification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He was participating in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial just to join in the fun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Furthermore, he had already joined the Void Sect. The latter was also a Super Sect. Once Sun Lingtong joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect, it would be tantamount to betraying his sect, which would invite big trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo knew Sun Lingtong's temperament well. Anyway, the latter had his Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability on him; if an accident occurred, he could just pull Sun Lingtong back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Moreover, the Myriad Manifestations Sect was magnanimous and treated everyone equally, even absorbing Demonic Cultivators to become members within their sect. Therefore, even if they discovered Sun Lingtong's identity as a member of the Void Sect, they wouldn't target him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo put away the Dao-Bearing Jade Pages, his mind still thinking about returning the Formation true meaning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"In the future, when I return the Formation true meaning, I'd best give Boss a bit more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"I have my Main Body Talent, as well as the Demon Soul experience, and my comprehension is passable. Raising my realm is far more convenient than for ordinary people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"So, even if my Formation realm returns to zero in the future, I can recover quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"But if I could master the 'Unity of Knowledge and Action' technique, that would be adding wings to a tiger!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The Unity of Knowledge and Action technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">This Confucian technique could reference a cultivator's actions and transform them into corresponding knowledge. Similarly, it could also transform the knowledge mastered by a cultivator into various actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">However, the Unity of Knowledge and Action technique was a technique of the School of Mind. Among the Confucian cultivator community in the Myriad Manifestations Sect, no one had mastered it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Even a genius Confucian cultivator famous throughout the Hua Zhang Kingdom like Gu Qing did not have it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">If Ning Zhuo wanted to obtain it, only Zhao Hansheng had it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">This was difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Last time, Ning Zhuo broke Zhao Hansheng's setup and publicly stepped on Gu Qing's head to seize first place in the minor trial. And mixed within was the gambling of the Confucian cultivator group's inclinations. Therefore, he and this pair of master and student were enemies, not friends.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">How could he make an enemy teach him the Confucian technique he desired?</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
