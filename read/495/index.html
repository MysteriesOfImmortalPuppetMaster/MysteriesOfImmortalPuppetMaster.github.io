<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 495: The Xuanyuan Nine-Work Platform</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Dragon King Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In order to counter the expedition army of the Two-Note Nation, the various factions of Thousand Peaks Forest gathered around the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King and set up a grand hall on Dragon King Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Inside the hall, a small number of cultivators, demon cultivators, barbarians, and gods sat around a giant sand-table round table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Only one green-robed cultivator stood at the table’s edge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">It was Lu Hongtu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Lu Hongtu wore a cold expression, his gaze as sharp as a blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He condensed his spiritual energy and lightly tapped the sand table before him. The sand table was a three-dimensional map of Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Several threads of spiritual energy formed four routes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Some routes were longer, while others were shorter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Everyone,” Lu Hongtu spoke in a low voice. “Ever since our army launched that surprise attack on the vanguard forces and temporarily trapped them, Du Tiechuan was injured by Prince Sheng Xu yet reacted extremely quickly. He immediately dispatched four armies for a counterattack.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“This is our latest military update.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Lu Hongtu’s fingers curled slightly, and the longest route among them swelled and thickened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He explained at the right moment: “The Golden Halberd Army led by Sun Gan has already broken through three checkpoints in a row with unstoppable momentum. For some reason, Du Tiechuan sent out this elite unit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“This army poses the greatest threat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“They will soon enter the territory of Bikun Mountain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“There are no barbarian tribes on Bikun Mountain, but at its peak lies a Bikun Pool. This pool yields Air Crystals and Bihu Stones in abundance, and void creatures often appear there.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Do we hand this precious resource over? If we don’t, Bikun Mountain has no natural barriers, so we must send a strong army to hold it. That’s the only way to possibly withstand the Golden Halberd Army.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">After a pause, Lu Hongtu continued introducing the other three armies’ situations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“The Red Flower Camp has climbed Cold Moon Mountain and is currently resting.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“The Barbarian-Demon Camp attacked Thunder Light Mountain but was defeated by the defending army and pulled back three miles to set up camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“As for the Three Generals Camp, they should be on Dice-Bone Mountain, engaged in fierce battle with the Dice-Bone Demon God.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">As soon as Lu Hongtu finished speaking, a messenger arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Upon hearing the urgent military report, Lu Hongtu’s expression changed slightly. He swept his gaze around and said in a deep voice, “Everyone, there’s a change in the situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Word just came: the Three Generals Camp has already taken Dice-Bone Mountain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">At this, the cultivators in the hall gasped softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“What? The Dice-Bone Demon God actually lost?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Did he withdraw early to protect his followers?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“That shouldn’t be. He signed the divine contract with the Dragon King as well, and it was his own choice to defend his territory.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Hahaha, when the Dice-Bone Demon God arrives at Dragon King Mountain, I’ll be sure to mock him well!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Where is he now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Lu Hongtu’s Adam’s apple moved once, but he held back and did not reveal that the Dice-Bone Demon God had defected on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Although the Dice-Bone Demon God only had Golden Core cultivation, his combat strength was outstanding. Once he activated his domain, he could hold off a Nascent Soul-level adversary for some time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">These facts were well-known throughout Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Hence, everyone (including Lu Hongtu) had been confident in leaving the Dice-Bone Demon God to defend that area. No one had expected him to be quickly defeated and then surrender!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Lu Hongtu estimated that if he disclosed this piece of military intelligence, it would undoubtedly cause unrest in Thousand Peaks Forest and inevitably spawn a great deal of panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Such a thorny matter is best left for the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King to handle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Lu Hongtu decided to focus on his duties as a strategist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Wait!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">His heart skipped a beat. Suddenly, he sensed something wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“The Dice-Bone Demon God may be just Golden Core, but having become a god, he can unleash his domain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“His domain is very peculiar, so we had invited him before for the plan to ambush the Two-Note Nation’s transport convoy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Now that he has defected on the battlefield, could this information be compromised?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Lu Hongtu instantly did some quick calculations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">After sizing up the timings, cold sweat appeared on his forehead. “It’s risky.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“If the information has already leaked, and the enemy sends word at top speed, they can be forewarned in time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“We have to make them act immediately!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">At that thought, Lu Hongtu immediately used his divine sense to pass down orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">There were many people present in the hall, and ears were everywhere. Only a select few knew of this ambush plan. Before the outcome was decided, everything had to remain strictly confidential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Wooden Wheel Town.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Marshal’s Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Du Tiechuan and Shuang Ling were secretly discussing military affairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Du Tiechuan said, “Cough, cough, cough, Your Highness, you’ve only made six thousand units of your Treading Mountain Wheels, which is far short of the intended total of eighteen thousand. That leaves a gap of twelve thousand.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Right now, our vanguard army is trapped, and your Treading Mountain Wheels are crucial for lifting this crisis!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Shuang Ling nodded. “Thousand Peaks Forest trapped our vanguard army, hoping to force our troops to rescue them. We must not fight on a battlefield arranged by the enemy, or else we’d be walking straight into their trap.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Rest assured, Marshal Du.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“All the follow-up components and materials are in the most recent transport convoy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“I even spent most of my family fortune to purchase multiple mechanical bases from other nations. Using those to produce Treading Mountain Wheels, we can be thirty times faster than I could manage on my own!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Du Tiechuan nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Shuang Ling said, “There’s no problem with my mechanical wheels. But, Marshal Du, what about your injuries? How much have you recovered?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“If we launch a large-scale offensive on Dragon King Mountain, a huge battle is sure to break out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“At that time, we will likely have to face the domain of the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King and also Prince Sheng Xu, who can fight above his level at the Soul Formation stage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Du Tiechuan sighed. “Indeed, Sheng Xu deserves his title as a prince-level figure. His Void Devouring Sutra is peerless. It wasn’t he who injured me —it was I who injured myself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Because of that, however, I am more certain of my recovery.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Don’t worry. By the time the great battle comes, my wounds will have healed. Then, my true body will come to reinforce our forces. We might even be able to enlist the help of a Soul Formation-level State Beast.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Shuang Ling breathed a sigh of relief. “That would be for the best!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">No-Thief Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“This is the place,” Sun Lingtong said as he controlled the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, comparing the map while he spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He had used the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon far more times than Ning Zhuo had, so his skill was more refined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">They snuck the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to the vicinity of the valley. To avoid alarming the enemy, they dared not get too close.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">They waited only a short while before hearing the sound of carriages and horses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Before long, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo saw a transport convoy moving in a long, snaking line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Scouts spread out in all directions, conducting detailed reconnaissance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Many scouts returned from No-Thief Valley to report to the Two-Note Nation’s Nascent Soul cultivator who led the convoy. They found no sign of the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Two-Note Nation’s Nascent Soul cultivators also personally employed various methods of detection. Having confirmed there was no hidden danger, they waved their hands and led the troops into No-Thief Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">No-Thief Valley had a bit of a backstory connected to a famous minister named Gu Wenjing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Gu Wenjing was born into a prominent family but was intelligent and broad-minded. He understood the hardships of the people and was full of compassion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He was never arrogant; in all his deeds, he put the people’s well-being first. At the age of thirty, he was appointed governor of this land.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">At the time, it was a place of barren mountains and treacherous rivers, full of cunning folk and endless bandits who could not be eradicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Upon taking office, Gu Wenjing did not do what his predecessors had done —raising an army and going into the mountains to eliminate bandits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Instead, he took swift and fierce measures to reorganize every industry within his jurisdiction, improve social customs, build water conservancy projects, pave roads, and vigorously develop agriculture and commerce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He started with various measures to reassure the people, easing their resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He then reduced taxes and labor obligations, lifting many burdens from the populace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Afterward, he gathered manpower and resources to repair the run-down farmland dikes, waterwheels, and so on, improved farming techniques, and promoted them widely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Day after day, year after year, Gu Wenjing’s reputation among the people grew steadily until it shone like the midday sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">As the people’s lives became more prosperous, their hearts gradually grew secure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Only in the final three months of his term did Gu Wenjing officially “make a move” against the bandits in the valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He did not dispatch any troops. He merely posted an “Innocence Notice” on the city gates, announcing that within three months, any bandit who surrendered would not be held accountable for past offenses—except for serious crimes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Not only that, but the government allocated good farmland to any bandit who surrendered, giving them land to till so a typical cultivator’s family could live in peace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">With this decree, the bandits flocked to surrender.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Just like that, the bandit scourge that had plagued an entire nation for years was eradicated by Gu Wenjing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">When Gu Wenjing was transferred elsewhere, the valley that had once teemed with bandits was renamed by later generations. To commemorate Gu Wenjing’s great achievements, it was renamed No-Thief Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Yet on this day, No-Thief Valley was crawling with numerous bandits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Fellow Daoist Wu Hen, we owe it to your technique. Otherwise, we’d have been discovered,” said Diao Ye, the Withering Poison General of the Hundred Poison Tribe, sounding very relieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Wu Hen wore a black robe, his long hair in disarray. He spoke blandly: “Let’s do it. I don’t know why, but I have a bad feeling.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">In the next moment, as soon as the transport convoy entered the valley, this group from Thousand Peaks Forest launched their assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Aoo—!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Wolves poured down like a tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">It was the work of Lone Fang from the Pale Moon Tribe, commanding the wolf pack’s advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Caught off guard, the transport convoy fell into chaos, suffering heavy casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Enraged, the Nascent Soul cultivator escorting the convoy brandished his sword, employing battlefield tactics. First he reinforced the army’s defenses, then prepared to shift formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Among the ambushers from Thousand Peaks Forest, the Cang Vine King donned an ancient vine-armor and took out a black bow, firing arrow after arrow of green vines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Soldiers at critical points in the formation sprouted vines from their bodies and died on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">This disrupted the formation shift, slowing it by several times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The Nascent Soul cultivator was furious. He first employed the Speed Is of the Essence tactic from his battlefield techniques and then activated his General’s Seal, channeling the embedded martial strategies to bolster the entire army’s defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Finally, he produced a command token. While tossing it out, he issued constant orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The formless power of the army promptly dragged cultivators one by one to the key positions —by force if necessary —to help complete the formation shift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The ambushers had prepared countermeasures long in advance. A Nascent Soul cultivator among them reached into his bag and threw a handful of green beans into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">In the next moment, those beans turned into one green-turbaned strongman after another, dropping down from the sky and charging into the ranks of the Two-Note Nation’s troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The soldiers still wanted to shift formation, but that became impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">These green-turbaned strongmen were each as solid as green rock, incredibly tough, with formidable defenses. Unless they were dealt with, there was no way the transport convoy could complete its formation shift smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The escorts had no choice but to switch orders, deploying their elite forces to deal with the hulking green-turbaned strongmen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">A blind barbarian cultivator named Di Lu, the eccentric Wu Hen, and the spear-throwing Withering Poison General Diao Ye charged into the fray, converging on the Nascent Soul officer in charge of the convoy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">That officer blocked attack after attack, gradually falling behind. He continued funneling the army’s power into himself to withstand the siege. As a result, the army’s strength was mostly centered on him, weakening the support to the rank and file. Many soldiers died in the fierce fighting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Sun Lingtong fixed his gaze on the battlefield. “Really? Has the Two-Note Nation not learned their lesson from the last ambush?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">No sooner had he spoken than two Nascent Soul cultivators descended from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“Criminals of Thousand Peaks Forest, I, Floating Cloud Master (and I, Mountain Peak Master), have been lying in wait for you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">They spoke in unison, matching each other perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">One cast cloud-based magic, unleashing pure white cloud-ropes that immobilized many of the green-turbaned strongmen, turning them into motionless targets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The other gripped a small mountain-shaped magic treasure, repeatedly releasing grand mountain seals that forced back many barbarian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo’s eyes glinted. “Those two are well-known rogue cultivators from the Two-Note Nation, with formidable Nascent Soul-level strength. Looks like the military recruited them this time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Suffering defeat in a previous ambush, the Two-Note Nation learned its lesson. They valued the security of their supply lines and secretly paid a large sum to hire Floating Cloud Master and Mountain Peak Master, who were close friends.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Their fame was well-deserved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">These two were indeed powerful, and above all, they could cooperate seamlessly: one active, one passive, one soft, one hard. They could even combine their moves to unleash tremendous power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Thousand Peaks Forest had no army of its own, relying instead on individual cultivators of high skill and power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The Two-Note Nation’s transport convoy had been severely disrupted, struggling to shift formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Under such circumstances, it was the individual experts who decided the battlefield’s outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">A fierce struggle ensued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Heaven and earth were thrown into turmoil, the sun and moon lost their light. The killing cries were deafening, and blood flowed until it gathered around the spears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Both sides fought till the sky turned dark and the earth shook, gradually wearing themselves out. The ones who truly suffered were the ordinary soldiers, who died in droves from the shockwaves of these high-level clashes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">“It’s about time. Let’s move!” Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo had waited patiently. Seeing the timing was right, they sprang into action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Earth Burrow Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">In the next instant, a huge, round stone sphere emerged from underground, arriving before a mechanical carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Steal Technique —Material Snatch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Everything inside the mechanical carriage was swiftly swallowed up by the stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">“Old Stone Monster?!” Both sides paused in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">“Perfect, Old Stone Monster is here to help us! Victory is assured, and we can smash all these supplies!” shouted Chen Lingfeng, the hawk-headed demon cultivator, releasing a wind blade as he spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Yet in the next moment, that wind blade was destroyed by “Old Stone Monster.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The creature growled, “Don’t ruin my business. You fight your fight.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">With that, it instantly looted the carriage that had just been targeted by the wind blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Chen Lingfeng was momentarily at a loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“Old Stone Monster came for the supplies?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">“Stop him, stop him now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The three Nascent Soul cultivators from the Two-Note Nation grew flustered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Only they knew how immensely valuable the contents of these transports were!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">But Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo controlled the stone sphere, which burrowed back underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">The three Nascent Soul cultivators of the Two-Note Nation could not block it, so they could only turn and engage Thousand Peaks Forest’s forces again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">After succeeding the first time, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo lay low and waited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">When both sides were once again locked in brutal combat, “Old Stone Monster” resurfaced to loot another mechanical carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">“These are mechanical bases?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">“Wait, this…this is the Xuanyuan Nine-Work Platform?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Ning Zhuo was dumbfounded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Any Xuanyuan Nine-Work Platform was a Nascent Soul-level mechanical base.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
