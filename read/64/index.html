<paragraph index="1">In the Monkey Head Gang’s headquarters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Yuan Er glared angrily at the messenger. “What did you just say? You want me to hand over the monkey corpses? You’re going to give them to that Flying Disk Workshop for refining?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He was so infuriated that his hair was standing on end. His eyes were blood-red, and when he opened his mouth to shout, it almost seemed like he was ready to eat someone alive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The messenger’s face was expressionless. “This is Sir Fei Si’s demand. Your Monkey Head Gang is far too disappointing. With all these dead monkey pets, how can you possibly live up to Sir Fei Si’s expectations?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“It’s better to make good use of these monkey corpses to create more mechanical monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“This year’s Fire Persimmon Festival is no ordinary event! Even Sir City Lord will be watching. You have to look at the bigger picture.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The mention of the “bigger picture” caused Yuan Er to instantly go pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Gritting his teeth, he said, “I… I need to think this over…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The messenger interrupted him, saying, “There’s no need to think. Just follow the demand. This is an order!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He then glanced to the side, noticing Yuan Dasheng sitting like a crouching tiger. His pupils contracted slightly, and his tone softened. “Well, I do understand your difficulties. I’ll give you some time to come to terms with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“I’ll be waiting outside the door. Don’t pin your hopes on me leaving empty-handed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“It’s best if you can adjust your mindset quickly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The messenger left the room and shut the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After he left, Yuan Er grabbed any objects in reach and smashed them violently on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The loud crashing wasn’t stopped by the door. Hearing it from outside, the messenger only sneered faintly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Absolutely outrageous!” Yuan Er roared. “It’s the Flying Disk Workshop, it’s definitely them! They’re the ones buying up wild monkeys, the ones posting bounties, the ones hiring demonic cultivators to kill our monkey pets. They’re the ones who tried to assassinate me!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“They’ve set their sights on the business of harvesting fire persimmons. They want to completely uproot our Monkey Head Gang!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Yuan Er’s roaring gradually gave way to a plaintive wail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Yuan Dasheng remained calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">It had been living with Yuan Er ever since the assassination attempt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">To prevent its soul from being drawn into the palace, it regularly harmed itself. This was its own speculation on how it could avoid triggering the soul-guiding mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Looking at Yuan Er, Yuan Dasheng felt as if it had returned to the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">There was a time Yuan Yi had been ambushed and suffered grave injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The attacker hadn’t concealed their name, nor had they held anything back in their words. “A beggar like you dares to dream of marrying my family’s young miss? Hah!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Give up on that dream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Let me be honest with you—I was sent by the young miss herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Remember this lesson. Stop dreaming, go take a piss, and have a look at your own face.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Seeing Yuan Yi barely breathing on the bed, Yuan Dasheng had flown into a rage and wanted to charge out to fight the enemy to the death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">But Yuan Yi had grabbed it tightly. “Da Sheng, Da Sheng! Calm down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Anger won’t solve anything!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“I’m determined to marry that Young Miss Zhang. Only a marriage will serve as a strong enough foothold for us to ally with her father’s gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Even if I’m humiliated, even if I’m injured in an ambush, I have to pretend that none of it ever happened.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Yuan Dasheng had stared at Yuan Yi, furiously shaken him off, and started smashing everything within reach. The intensity of its rage had caused the air itself to ripple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Yuan Yi had merely leaned against the wall, panting heavily as the bandages on his body seeped fresh blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">After waiting for Yuan Dasheng to calm down a little, he had walked back over and placed a hand on its shoulder, saying, “Da Sheng, I know you’re angry. I know that me being humiliated makes you even angrier than if you had been humiliated yourself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“But listen to me, listen…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“It’s not a disgrace to be born into poverty. Being able to bend and stretch is what makes a real man!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“I’m going to marry that woman. Her father already plans to cooperate with our Monkey Head Gang. This isn’t really up to her in the end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“We can’t stir up trouble right now. One outburst and the whole thing could fall apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“But I promise you that someday, I’ll return today’s humiliation ten times over!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“We have to get past this, Da Sheng.” At this point, Yuan Yi had clapped the ape’s shoulder heavily. “We must climb up, we must fight our way up. One day, we will stand high above!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Under Yuan Yi’s appeasement, the ape’s flushed face and furrowed brows had slowly eased, replaced by weariness and sorrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">And now…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Its descendants had been poisoned, and not even permitted the grace of a burial. They were to be used as materials for the enemy to make mechanical puppets!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Yuan Dasheng’s chest burned with fiery rage, but its expression was eerily calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Looking quietly at Yuan Er, who was still smashing things in fury, it recalled its old comrade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Sadly, that comrade was long gone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">So the ape’s anger carried a trace of sorrow as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Standing slowly, it walked to Yuan Er’s side and gently placed a hand on his shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yuan Er’s body trembled. When he looked back and saw Yuan Dasheng, he immediately collapsed to the floor. Tears poured from his eyes as he called out, “Uncle Monkey!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo’s puppet body had been waiting quietly for quite some time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">At last, he was finally convinced that Yuan Dasheng would not re-enter the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“The plan worked!” Ning Zhuo thought to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Whether it was paying demonic cultivators to repeatedly attacking Monkey Head Gang’s monkey pets, or the intentionally failed assassination attempt on Yuan Er, everything was to put pressure on Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Now it seemed the results were satisfactory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yuan Dasheng had clearly sensed the coming storm. With the Monkey Head Gang under attack, how could it still be in the mood to explore the immortal palace?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“This way, none of the four major forces will discover Yuan Dasheng for the time being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Moreover, Yuan Dasheng won’t have the chance to meet the other competitors, causing it to misjudge the situation in the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“As for myself… I’m still walking on a razor’s edge.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zhu Xuanji, a member of the Divine Investigation Bureau, had arrived far earlier than expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Still, Ning Zhuo had already made preparations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Cultivators of the Divine Investigation Bureau focus on two main techniques: the Clear Heart Warning Incantation and the Root Tracking Origin Tracing Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“The former is the basis of the Warning Heart Bell’s power, while the latter can dig out closely connected objects.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">If Ning Zhuo had bombed the immortal palace himself, the Root Tracking Origin Tracing Incantation would definitely expose him. To resolve this issue, Ning Zhuo proactively revealed himself, met with Chen Cha, and deliberately exposed the explosive fire monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">His previous setup had now come into effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“But how long can I keep it hidden?” Ning Zhuo didn’t know. At any moment, he might be exposed and hunted down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He had long been mentally prepared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">All he could do now was seize every moment to keep pressing forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Now, I just have to wait for the Fire Persimmon Festival.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Zhu Xuanji and Chi Dun concealed their presence and walked out of the black market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Chi Dun was puzzled. “Sir Zhu, what’s going on? No one can lie in front of your Golden Pupils, but according to the people here, there haven’t been any large-scale purchases of fire essence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Zhu Xuanji was silent for a moment, then smiled faintly. “Looks like the culprit came prepared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“From the mechanical monkeys alone, it’s clear that they were deliberately guarding against the bureau’s Root Tracking Origin Tracing Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“No bulk purchase of fire essence was found in any of Fire Persimmon City’s markets. Either the culprit made a large-scale purchase elsewhere, or they bought it in smaller batches over a long period of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Either way, their actions were carefully planned!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Chi Dun asked, “Then what do we do next?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Zhu Xuanji stroked his chin and sighed. “Next, we prepare for Fire Persimmon Festival!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
