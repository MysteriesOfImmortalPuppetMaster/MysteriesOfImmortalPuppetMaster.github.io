<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Let me defeat you." Hua Guzi's spiritual energy was depleted.<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element—Flower Sea Tide!<br/>
<br/>
Petals converged into massive waves that swept across the battlefield and surged toward Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face was stern as he pushed both palms forward.<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element—Pine Billows Emerald Waves.<br/>
<br/>
Wood elemental spiritual power surged forth, forming a colossal stream of green light that deflected back against the pink Flower Sea Tide.<br/>
<br/>
Rumble...<br/>
<br/>
The two mighty waves collided, generating endless surges one after another with astonishing force, shaking the entire battlefield along with the hearts of those observing it.<br/>
<br/>
However, the deadlock did not last long before the tide of red-pink flowers overpowered the jade-green waves, pushing the lines of battle steadily toward Ning Zhuo's position.<br/>
<br/>
The situation on the field became clear at once, sparking animated discussion among the spectators.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo is under quite a bit of pressure!"<br/>
<br/>
"She cultivates a specific set of five elements of magic; attacking solely with wood won't fully reveal her true combat prowess."<br/>
<br/>
"Her techniques are quite profound, allowing her to freely convert between the five elements. Moreover, through augmentation, they can be doubled in strength. With such outstanding technique, she ought to utilize fire and metal elements as well."<br/>
<br/>
"Only in this battle will we know her true strength."<br/>
<br/>
"Young people are always full of vigor; wanting to use wood-element magic to compete directly with Hua Guzi's wood-element magic is understandable, ha ha."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's expression remained solemn.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi's technique was quite remarkable; it could freely convert between all five elements and, with augmentation, produce results double that of its original.<br/>
<br/>
His wood elemental abilities were merely three strikes, relying heavily on the Enlightenment Diagrams he had learned.<br/>
<br/>
But Hua Guzi had chosen this strategy not to compete directly with her in the wood elemental realm, but rather to test herself through actual combat and confirm her true positioning.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi specialized in wood elemental techniques, making her one of the top ten combatants at the Little Contention Peak.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo knew very well that he'd spent far less time and energy cultivating his own wood elemental powers compared to Hua Guzi, so defeating her using these methods would be extremely difficult.<br/>
<br/>
He had never underestimated any outstanding talent, only wished to first compare himself against such a veteran cultivator like Hua Guzi, to see how much weight his skills truly held.<br/>
<br/>
"Hua Guzi devised a counter-strategy specifically for me!"<br/>
<br/>
"She uses 'the delaying game' to respond to my rush tactic."<br/>
<br/>
"Much of my wood elemental magic has been corroded, absorbed, transformed, and bolstered by her, increasing her battle prowess."<br/>
<br/>
"I've learned something valuable from this."<br/>
<br/>
"She excels across the board in terms of wood elemental cultivation, so she can use wood elemental techniques to counteract mine."<br/>
<br/>
"The implementation of this delaying tactic is predicated upon certain conditions."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained unworried.<br/>
<br/>
When the Flower Sea Tide reached him within five steps, he finally unleashed his mechanical fists. The materials used to craft them were Foundation Establishment-grade, more than capable of resisting the Flower Sea Tide alone.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, they were equipped with defensive spell formations and talismans, making them extremely sturdy.<br/>
<br/>
They circled around Ning Zhuo, then pounced one after another. With various punches and kicks unleashed, they punched countless holes into the Flower Sea Tide.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo persevered, using twenty machine fists to completely disperse the red-pink light waves.<br/>
<br/>
"Mechanical techniques!" The crowd was astonished.<br/>
<br/>
They had thought that Ning Zhuo would employ five elements magic to fight against Hua Guzi.<br/>
<br/>
Yet Ning Zhuo suddenly produced so many mechanisms, and his proficiency far exceeded the ordinary user.<br/>
<br/>
"Go." After successfully extricating himself from danger with the aid of mechanical fists, Ning Zhuo swiftly manipulated the strings attached to each fist, commanding them to charge directly at Hua Guzi.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi revealed a cruel smile, took a deep breath, and unleashed a wood elemental technique: Thorny Blossom Wall! Thorns extended outward, forming several flower walls within a few breaths' time, which blocked Ning Zhuo’s path.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stepped forward, simultaneously controlling the machine fists while executing martial arts.<br/>
<br/>
Martial arts—Bitter Suffering Strike!<br/>
<br/>
Martial arts—Frost Fist!<br/>
<br/>
Martial arts—Old Man's Cold Legs!<br/>
<br/>
The machine fists charged recklessly, their combat style identical to Han Zhou's, completely disregarding any potential harm to themselves as they rushed headlong into the thorny blossoms.<br/>
<br/>
If they were flesh-and-blood bodies, such reckless maneuvers would inevitably leave them battered and bleeding.<br/>
<br/>
The thorny blossom wall functioned both defensively and offensively, proving quite useful.<br/>
<br/>
But these mechanical creations were neither flesh nor cultivator; Ning Zhuo could command them without any reservations.<br/>
<br/>
Bitter cold swept through the air like a tempest. The flowering thorns burst one by one, frozen in their blossoms as they succumbed to the freezing onslaught.<br/>
<br/>
And that wasn't all—because of the suffering body enchantment, each time these machines sustained damage, they became faster and more aggressive, their defenses stronger.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi's complexion shifted slightly, and she retreated while unleashing his magic: Wood Element—Violent Purple Flames!<br/>
<br/>
Wood elemental spiritual power surged forth, forming several purple flowers the size of grinding wheels in midair.<br/>
<br/>
As the purple blooms bloomed, their petals spun continuously like windmills, shooting bursts of flame from their centers.<br/>
<br/>
This flame was violet with streaks of crimson, red with streaks of violet. When it landed on trees and flowers nurtured by wood elemental spiritual power, it did not harm a single petal—but when it touched the mechanical constructs, it left behind a steadfast burn that continued unabated.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Arts—Bitter Water!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had trained extensively with Han Zhou, absorbing bitter cold spiritual energy to forge the bitter water, so he possessed excellent mastery over various martial arts.<br/>
<br/>
He swiftly controlled the mechanical fists at a distance, altering their forms into the stance of drunk fist strikes, then unleashed a flurry of punches against the surrounding constructs.<br/>
<br/>
In that instant, the compressed bitter cold energy transformed into cupfuls of bitter water, drenching all surrounding mechanical fists and extinguishing their violet flames.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical fists worked together, not only resolving the problem of the burning flames but also fortifying their martial prowess with the bitter water's immersion.<br/>
<br/>
Bam! Bam! Bam!<br/>
<br/>
Each fist moved with increased speed, transforming from birds into cannonballs.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical fists arrived before Hua Guzi.<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element: Bewildering Fragrant Blossom.<br/>
<br/>
Realizing her inferior speed, Hua Guzi knew she couldn't possibly buy time through evasive maneuvers alone, so she resorted to magic instead. She vanished on the spot, leaving behind nothing but traces of fragrance, no trace of her whereabouts discernible.<br/>
<br/>
Boom! Boom! Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical fists struck where she had disappeared, shattering countless tiles beneath them as they flew in every direction, billowing smoke and dust, the ground quaking incessantly.<br/>
<br/>
The spectators fell silent. They hadn't anticipated the battlefield's turn for the worse would happen so swiftly!<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Ning Zhuo deployed these mechanical fists, he had turned the tide, now attacking aggressively, forcing Hua Guzi to flee.<br/>
<br/>
"Didn't he cultivate five elements magic?"<br/>
<br/>
"How is he so skilled at mechanism techniques too?!"<br/>
<br/>
"No—I feel like his mastery over controlling mechanisms is far more refined than his wood elemental techniques."<br/>
<br/>
Countless gazes focused on Ning Zhuo, many with complicated expressions.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was merely sixteen years old.<br/>
<br/>
At his age, having mastered wood elemental techniques such as Tree Realm Descent was already uncommon enough to be noteworthy.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone had assumed this would comprise the main portion of Ning Zhuo's combat abilities, but during this match, he revealed his proficiency with mechanism techniques and his unparalleled mastery over them... People found themselves unable to fully comprehend Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi was forced to flee in every direction!<br/>
<br/>
The training grounds were only so large, and mechanical fists moved swiftly. Even if Hua Guzi could perform short-range teleportation, she often found herself quickly pursued.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo! Don't get too cocky!" Hua Guzi shrieked.<br/>
<br/>
She knew her situation was dire; if she didn't reveal her trump card soon, she truly would lose.<br/>
<br/>
Wood Element—Flower-Flower World!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, Ning Zhuo's surroundings abruptly changed, and the training grounds disappeared altogether. He discovered that he had been transported into a world where countless blossoms bloomed in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
"An illusion!" Ning Zhuo realized instantly.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes glowed as he observed the technique of the Flower-Flower World and noticed Hua Guzi making her move toward Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo..." Sun Lingtong felt some apprehension and prepared to intervene. If Ning Zhuo were to fall into danger, he would activate the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to protect him.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, in the following moment, Buddha light suddenly appeared on the mechanical fists' strikes.<br/>
<br/>
Ray after ray of Buddha light was like colossal hands effortlessly tearing apart the entirety of Flower-Flower World.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi paled with fright, feeling streams of terrifyingly powerful divine consciousness piercing through her spiritual seas, strong and unyielding, like giant diamond clubs smashing directly against her mind.<br/>
<br/>
"How could there be such formidable divine consciousness?! Wah." Just as Hua Guzi was about to reach Ning Zhuo, she coughed up blood from the sudden onslaught.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that Hua Guzi's Flower-Flower World technique required her full mental participation, using divine consciousness to cover the target's senses and suppress their spirit.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo's divine consciousness had unexpectedly surged. Like water extinguishing fire, but a single cup of water is not only powerless against raging flames—it will evaporate under its heat.<br/>
<br/>
"Hm?" Sun Lingtong's eyes widened in surprise and delight—he hadn't anticipated Ning Zhuo having this kind of ability.<br/>
<br/>
"What's happening?"<br/>
<br/>
Through his observation with the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, Sun Lingtong discovered that all twenty mechanisms controlled by Ning Zhuo were emitting powerful pulses of spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh! The Vajra Mirrors!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed, struck by realization.<br/>
<br/>
Back at the village on Misty Mountain, he had once competed with Ning Zhuo in terms of spiritual energy and learned that the spiritual energy required to cast the Summoning Platform spell needed to be paired with physical objects to undergo a metamorphosis.<br/>
<br/>
Later, after leaving Misty Mountain and arriving here at the Myriad Medicine Sect, Sun Lingtong knew that Ning Zhuo had crafted a Vajra Mirror talisman.<br/>
<br/>
"So these mechanism fists contain one Vajra Mirror each."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong found this quite intriguing.<br/>
<br/>
Each Vajra Mirror could receive Ning Zhuo's spiritual energy, relay it, then project it outward.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's Spirit Communication Platform, transformed by these mirrors, became extremely robust and sturdy, smashing through Hua Guzi's Flower-Flower World with immense force—essentially, overwhelming her with sheer power!<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi's spiritual energy was gravely damaged; her mind reeled as she struggled to maintain consciousness. Her combat experience kicked in immediately, shifting her strategy from offense to defense, and she retreated madly.<br/>
<br/>
However Ning Zhuo failed to seize this opportunity, allowing the vines to escape  with her.<br/>
<br/>
Hua Guzi retrieved dumplings from her bag of holding, swallowing them whole with each bite, quickly recovering her strength.<br/>
<br/>
This scene reminded Sun Lingtong of certain information: not only was Hua Guzi adept at battle, but she was also a skilled spiritual chef well versed in various culinary techniques within cultivation's myriad arts.<br/>
