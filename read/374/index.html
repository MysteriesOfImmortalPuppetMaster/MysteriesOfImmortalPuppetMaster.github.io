<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 374: Ning Zhuo is Still Too Naive</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
On Great Contention Peak, behind the mountain, in the Ten Thousand Demons Cave.<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother!"<br/>
"Senior Brother! We've come to see you."<br/>
A group of people called out at the entrance of the cave.<br/>
<br/>
After a few breaths, Linghu Jiu's voice came: "Come in."<br/>
<br/>
Led by Lao De, a group of fellow disciples all rushed into the Ten Thousand Demons Cave, greeting Linghu Jiu respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother, are you doing well here?" Lao De spoke first.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu shrugged: "Everything's fine. You all know that I'm already used to the environment here."<br/>
<br/>
"What I'm more worried about is our little junior sister."<br/>
<br/>
"She has a lively personality. Being confined to her room for all this time, won't she be bored to death?"<br/>
<br/>
The fellow disciples sighed along, and immediately started talking one after another.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, I'm worried about her too, just like Senior Brother."<br/>
<br/>
"Yesterday, I got six musical note insects and put them in a cup. I had her personal maid deliver them to her to play with."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh? I just sent her a mechanical puppet the day before yesterday."<br/>
<br/>
"I pleaded with the Master on her behalf, but I was harshly scolded, sigh..."<br/>
<br/>
All the fellow disciples had good relationships with each other. This was because when Lin Bu Fan took on disciples, he deliberately chose those of similar ages and raised them together since childhood.<br/>
<br/>
These people grew up together, naturally developing deep bonds.<br/>
<br/>
Lao De changed the subject: "In my opinion, my junior sister went too far this time. I don't know what kind of love potion Ning Zhuo gave her, even getting her to help him to that extent."<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother, we've pooled our resources and cleared junior sister's external debts."<br/>
<br/>
"But we can't let Ning Zhuo off the hook. He needs to be taught a lesson. Otherwise, everyone's morale will be affected."<br/>
<br/>
As the topic turned to Ning Zhuo, it immediately resonated with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, yes, that Ning Zhuo is too cunning. He relies on his good looks and sweet talk to deceive our junior sister!"<br/>
<br/>
"We all made huge sacrifices to cover the debt, but in the end, he reaped the biggest benefits. This absolutely cannot stand."<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother, among us brothers, you treat our junior sister the best. We don't approve of anyone else, only you."<br/>
<br/>
"That's right, Senior Brother!"<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother, we've discussed it. If we personally deal with Ning Zhuo, it wouldn't look good. Why don't we use the sect rules to instigate other resident cultivators to cause trouble for that Ning Zhuo fellow?"<br/>
<br/>
"You don't know, while junior sister is confined in her cell, depressed, that guy acts like nothing happened. He abandoned junior sister and only cares about sparring and discussing martial arts with his new friend, Han Zhou, living quite comfortably!"<br/>
<br/>
Hearing this, Linghu Jiu's face turned serious, and he shook his head in refusal: "This cannot be done."<br/>
<br/>
"There are no secrets under heaven. If you instigate other cultivators to deal with Ning Zhuo, it will greatly damage our Myriad Medicine Sect's reputation."<br/>
<br/>
"If this gets exposed, the achievements our sect has carefully built up over so many years will be half lost."<br/>
<br/>
"How can we, for the sake of personal interests, disregard the benefits of the entire sect?"<br/>
<br/>
The fellow disciples fell silent, looking at each other.<br/>
<br/>
Lao De unwillingly said: "Then Senior Brother, are we just going to let Ning Zhuo enjoy such benefits? He's been making rapid progress lately, but many of these cultivation resources came out of our own pockets."<br/>
<br/>
"We only need to show a little intention, and those resident cultivators will come like cats smelling fish, willingly helping us deal with Ning Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
"And to make them keep it secret, we just need to sign a contract."<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu sighed: "Human hearts are fickle. For however much they rely on us now, they may come to hate us just as much in the future. On the contrary, those who always maintain a calm attitude are much more reliable in character."<br/>
<br/>
"Such underhanded matters are not what we righteous gentlemen should do. Don't think about it anymore."<br/>
<br/>
"I've long been curious about this friend Ning Zhuo. When I get out in the future, I must meet him personally."<br/>
<br/>
Lao De sighed: "If that's the case, then let Senior Brother handle it yourself."<br/>
<br/>
The brothers chatted and laughed for a while longer before reluctantly saying goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
After leaving Great Contention Peak, the other brothers discussed discontentedly: "Are we really going to let this go?"<br/>
<br/>
"Since Senior Brother said so, let's do as he says."<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Brother has been confined for several months, right? By then, it'll be too late. Ning Zhuo might have already run away!"<br/>
<br/>
"If it was just about him being greedy, we could let it go. The key is that he deceived our junior sister's feelings and used her. How can we tolerate that?!"<br/>
<br/>
Lao De smiled slightly: "Senior Brother is just worried that we might damage the Myriad Medicine Sect's reputation."<br/>
<br/>
"How about this: we won't appear in person, we won't personally have secret talks with those resident cultivators, and we won't even give hints privately."<br/>
<br/>
"We'll just spread rumors! In my opinion, Ning Zhuo has risen too fast. Initially, he was in a cave dwelling ranked over 200, but now he's suddenly in the top ten."<br/>
<br/>
"In the last battle, he quickly defeated Chang Yan. Can that truly reflect his real strength?"<br/>
<br/>
"I think there are quite a few people who share my doubts!"<br/>
<br/>
"We just need to stir up some rumors, and it should be enough to instigate others to challenge Ning Zhuo on their own."<br/>
<br/>
Hearing this, the others' eyes lit up, and they praised the idea repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
"Good plan, good plan indeed."<br/>
<br/>
"This method is good. We're not getting involved, just spreading rumors."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if there's an investigation, it can't be traced back to us."<br/>
<br/>
On Little Contention Peak, at the training ground.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Han Zhou were sparring.<br/>
<br/>
However unlike before, Han Zhou was at a disadvantage, while Ning Zhuo firmly held the upper hand.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for all this was the mechanical arms and legs floating around Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
These arms, like floating hands, could hover in mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo controlled them, constantly using the martial art Frost Punch, and using those mechanical legs to perform the martial art Old Cold Leg.<br/>
<br/>
If Han Zhou was facing just two hands and two feet, it would have been fine. But the problem was, he was facing an onslaught from ten arms and ten legs at once!<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou felt like he was being surrounded by a group of enemies and could only keep retreating, trying to find an opening.<br/>
<br/>
However, he was surprised to find that Ning Zhuo's mechanical control skills were extremely high. Not only did he control these mechanical hands and feet naturally and smoothly, but the formation was also tight, with mutual cooperation. There was never a reckless move, leaving no openings to speak of!<br/>
<br/>
"You... let's stop, stop for now." Han Zhou was beaten for a while and couldn't take it anymore, directly waving his hand to call for a stop.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was still eager to continue: "Brother Han Zhou, I haven't mastered the control of these mechanisms yet. I just had quite a few insights, perhaps I could use these mechanisms to perform different bitter cold martial arts."<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou's eyes twitched.<br/>
<br/>
He sincerely praised: "Friend Ning Zhuo, I never imagined your mechanical control skills were so formidable. They're definitely stronger than your martial arts, no, even your five element art!"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou had traveled to various places and broadened his horizons. After personally engaging with Ning Zhuo and experiencing his mechanical skills, he immediately revised his understanding and evaluation of Ning Zhuo in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
"So, Friend Ning Zhuo has been hiding his true abilities. What he's really good at isn't the five elements art at all."<br/>
<br/>
This was very different from the estimations of the outsiders!<br/>
<br/>
"Since that's the case, why don't you rest for a while, Brother Han Zhou, and then we'll practice again." Ning Zhuo's smile was like a spring breeze caressing one's face.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou wasn't keen on continuing to spar, but under the influence of Ning Zhuo's Buddha's Heart Demon Seal, no, his smile, he still nodded.<br/>
<br/>
Watching Ning Zhuo stay in place, controlling these mechanical arms and legs on his own, training seriously, occasionally stopping to frown in thought, Han Zhou couldn't help but look forward to the day when Ning Zhuo would display this combat power in public, and how others would react.<br/>
<br/>
"Hehe." Thinking of this amusing scene, he couldn't help but laugh out loud.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's ears twitched slightly, hearing Han Zhou's laughter. A faint sense of joy also naturally arose in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Han Zhou gets along very well with me. When I first met him, he seemed quite melancholic. Now his heart has opened up, and the number of times he‚Äôs smiled has increased every day."<br/>
<br/>
"This feeling of being able to make those around you happy is really nice."<br/>
<br/>
Today's sparring session clearly left Han Zhou much more unsteady on his feet, while Ning Zhuo wore a satisfied smile.<br/>
<br/>
The sparring was very effective, which made him quite pleased.<br/>
<br/>
He and Han Zhou parted reluctantly, reminiscent of the days when he and Lin Shanshan spent time together.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou turned and walked a few steps, then suddenly stopped and called out to Ning Zhuo: "Friend Ning Zhuo, I almost forgot, the wind has been blowing in an odd direction lately."<br/>
<br/>
"What's wrong?" Ning Zhuo looked puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou said: "It's about you. I don't know if you've noticed recently, but there's been some unfavorable rumors circulating about you on Little Contention Peak."<br/>
<br/>
"They say you're arrogant and look down on people, that your strength is actually insufficient, and that you just got lucky in your previous battle with Chang Yan, taking advantage of a successful preemptive strike."<br/>
<br/>
"In my opinion, it's because you occupy one of the top ten caves on Little Contention Peak, making many people envious."<br/>
<br/>
"These people want to challenge you and compete for your cave dwelling, but they're afraid of failing. So they spread such rumors, trying to instigate others to challenge you more, paving the way for themselves."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately frowned: "So there's such a thing!"<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Han Zhou, thank you for your warning. Otherwise, I would have been kept in the dark." Ning Zhuo bowed deeply in gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou sighed: "Friend Ning Zhuo, you can't just focus on training without care for anything else. Little Contention Peak is not like your family environment. Many times, conflicts aren't just straightforward challenges, there's also a lot of behind-the-scenes scheming."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's brow furrowed even more: "Then what should I do?"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou didn't have any good solutions either, he just advised Ning Zhuo to be more vigilant: "I think you could challenge someone as soon as possible, showcasing your mechanical skills. This way, there won't be any more slanderous rumors about you."<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you for your guidance!" Ning Zhuo bowed in thanks again, expressing much gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
This caused Han Zhou to worry about Ning Zhuo as he left: "Ning Zhuo is, after all, a young master from a family. His thoughts are still too simple. Having just left home to travel, he doesn't know how treacherous people can be."<br/>
<br/>
"From these rumors, you can see that his previous living environment was relatively stable and pleasant."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, it's shameful to say. Even I, in approaching him and sparring with him, wasn't purely well-intentioned. Didn't I also want to enlighten him?"<br/>
