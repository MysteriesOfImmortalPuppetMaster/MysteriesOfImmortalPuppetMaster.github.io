<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the reception hall at Original Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Honored guests, please be seated," Lin Bufan said calmly, gesturing with his sleeve before taking his seat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zhu Xuanji, Shen Lingshu, Ning Jiufan, Ning Shou, and Lin Shanshan all sat down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Lin Bufan slowly raised his hand, signaling the Myriad Medicine Sect attendants to serve spirit tea and pastries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Jiufan stroked his beard with a smile and spoke first: "The tea and pastries aren't really important. Master Lin, please tell us about the Linglong Mirror Wall in the Monster Cave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This immediately captured everyone's attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo also laughed: "So that's it. The treasure in the Monster Cave is the Linglong Mirror Wall? Please forgive my ignorance, but I've never heard of such a thing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The grandfather and grandson pair worked in perfect harmony, like a coordinated attack from left and right, surrounding Lin Bufan who sat in the main seat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This caught both Zhu Xuanji's and Shen Lingshu's attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After appearing, Ning Zhuo had secretly communicated to Zhu Xuanji about how he discovered the treasure in the Monster Cave. He had originally intended to find the Thousand-Year Fire Essence in Fire Persimmon Mountain to treat Ning Jiufan's Ape, but unexpected events occurred. The Fire-Fusion Demon Ape and Ning Jiufan were captured by Lin Bufan. He asked Zhu Xuanji for help!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Shen Lingshu pondered secretly: "This Ning Zhuo is indeed skilled at scheming! Inviting Zhu Xuanji this time was to use our royal family's authority and his reputation as Divine Investigator to check Lin Bufan's power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Zhu Xuanji has fallen for the plot! Yet he has no choice but to go along with it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Let's see what this mysterious Linglong Mirror Wall is about."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhu Xuanji was lost in thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He thought to himself: "This Ning Jiufan is quite brave, putting himself in this situation - one moment a captive, the next moment appearing so casual."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"The bold spirit of the Northern lands is indeed admirable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Lin Bufan felt heavy-hearted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He clearly understood the current situation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Though he appeared to be in the position of power, having established himself here for over a hundred years as the local authority, he was actually in the weakest position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The combined strength of the Ning family's grandfather and grandson, Zhu Xuanji, and Shen Lingshu already made Lin Bufan nervous. Not to mention the enormous forces they represented behind them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"With both Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu arriving together, I fear there might be other powerful royal experts hiding in the shadows..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Looking at everyone present, he knew defeat was inevitable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">When Lin Bufan welcomed Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu into the Medicine Valley, he had already understood this point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">What he needed to do now was figure out how to maintain a stable footing in defeat and protect his and the Medicine Sect's interests!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Therefore, when faced with the coordinated "attack" from the Ning family's grandfather and grandson, Lin Bufan didn't immediately explain what the Linglong Mirror Wall was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">But he also knew he couldn't avoid explaining the matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">So, pointing at the tea that had been served before everyone, he said: "Years ago, when I was still at the Golden Core stage, my cultivation talent was insufficient, and I struggled to breakthrough to the Nascent Soul realm..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"In my frustration, I chose to travel the world seeking opportunities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Heaven favored me, allowing me to accidentally enter an formation in the Monster Cave, where I encountered Zhang Huaiyu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zhu Xuanji frowned: "The Grass Saint Zhang Huaiyu?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Lin Bufan nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Zhang Huaiyu was a historical figure who lived between the fall of the Forbidden Dynasty and before the Night Rain Dynasty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In his early years, he followed the path of Confucianism, with his calligraphy being upright and formal. After being demoted from his official position, he took to growing plants and living in seclusion, finding solace in nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Over time, he gained enlightenment from plants: taking Heaven and Earth as his teacher, incorporating nature into his spiritual cultivation. He studied calligraphy and created a unique wild grass script style called "Plant True Words," where every stroke appeared naturally formed. His written characters could be as fierce as a storm or as gentle as light clouds, all containing the subtle principles of Heaven and Earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Later generations honored him as the Grass Saint!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Historical records clearly stated that the Grass Saint had long since passed away. Yet Lin Bufan encountered him in the Monster Cave, obviously this Grass Saint was not the original person, but was related to the Linglong Mirror Wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Indeed, Lin Bufan continued: "Of course, who I encountered wasn't the Grass Saint himself, but rather his reflection that he had left on the Mirror Wall after discovering its mysteries and forming a connection with it. You can understand it as a Dharma Body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Although I lacked talent in cultivation, the Grass Saint's Dharma Body still guided me, passing on part of his legacy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"I received this inheritance, comprehended some of the Plant True Words, succeeded in cultivating spirit grass, and used this to break through from Golden Core to become a Nascent Soul cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">What followed was information that Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, and others had been able to investigate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">With his Nascent Soul cultivation, Lin Bufan rose to become the leader of the Medicine Gate. He implemented bold reforms, used various means to eliminate opposition, purge corruption, strengthen the sect's foundation, and remove harmful influences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">His most famous move was bypassing old regulations and contracts by directly relocating the entire sect, rendering many old power structures' contracts virtually worthless, reducing them to mere scraps of paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Lin Bufan said: "I paid a heavy price to move the entire sect to the Medicine Valley. On the surface, it was because the spirit springs here were abundant and suitable for growing various medicinal herbs, allowing me to fully utilize the Grass Saint's inheritance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"In reality, I wanted to continue exploring the opportunities in the Monster Cave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"In the time that followed, I made many attempts to enter the cave but was blocked by formations. I failed repeatedly, but no matter how many times I failed, my determination never wavered."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Finally one day, Grass Saint Zhang Huaiyu appeared again, telling me the spirit wall was too important. Even without an owner, it was waiting for a pillar of humanity, a genius among geniuses, and could never become the private property of an ordinary cultivator like me, telling me to give up my unrealistic hopes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"This left me depressed for many days."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"One day, feeling inspired, I created this spirit tea. Please, everyone, have a taste."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Everyone in the hall was somewhat surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">They had been listening to Lin Bufan reveal secret history, not expecting him to suddenly change the topic to spirit tea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But having been fully engaged in listening, they all instinctively looked at the cups before them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The cups were ancient and plain, like red pottery, with many rough spots on the surface, giving an impression of crude craftsmanship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In the cups, the tea leaves were sunset-red, with patterns like mountains and rivers faintly visible on the leaves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Shen Lingshu showed interest and was the first to pick up his cup and take a sip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">After tasting it, he immediately praised: "Excellent tea."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo also took a sip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">At first taste, it was slightly bitter with a subtle woody fragrance, like the cold air that hits you when first entering a forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">As the tea slid into his mouth and he savored it carefully, the tea's flavor gradually deepened, producing a slight sweetness with an endless aftertaste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After drinking, there was a moistening sensation in the throat, as if seeing thousands of miles of mountains and rivers standing still in time. There seemed to be old friends whispering in his ears, making one unconsciously immerse in it, inevitably generating a sense of melancholy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Seeing everyone silently appreciating the tea, Lin Bufan timely said: "I created this tea and named it 'Mountains, Rivers, and Old Friends.' The tea trees are rooted in the poorest soil, requiring daily nourishment with the essence of countless medicinal herbs to grow and produce leaves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"I was moved by thoughts of the ancients, and took this as my aspiration to strive again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"On one hand, I specially selected many orphaned children, tested their talents, and accepted them all as disciples. On another hand, I had the original mountain spirit permeate the Medicine Valley and the other three peaks as a long-term strategy. Finally, I implemented new policies, attracting cultivators to reside on Small Competition Peak, encouraging them to constantly compete, using this method to seek the Mirror Wall's favor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"The Linglong Mirror Wall was originally a wall from Still Jade Immortal Princess's palace. The Still Jade Immortal Princess was learned in both heavenly and human matters, and using the Martial Emperor's collection, she studied and practiced techniques gathered from all over the world. Over time, the wall gained consciousness and developed miraculous powers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"It can reflect all kinds of people from across the world, preserving specific reflections. You can understand these as a special kind of Dharma Body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"The Grass Saint Zhang Huaiyu I encountered earlier was one of these, specifically left behind by the Grass Saint himself to pass on his legacy to future generations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The hall fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">On one hand, everyone was quickly processing the impact of these secret revelations. On the other hand, they were all moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">When Lin Bufan encountered setbacks, he didn't give up, but instead found alternative paths, trying various other methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He had operated here for over a hundred years - this was a hundred years of solitary planning, unwavering determination, hiding his abilities and biding his time, waiting for the right moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The spirit tea he created, "Mountains, Rivers, and Old Friends," wasn't this expressing his aspirations? He wanted to emulate figures like the Grass Saint Zhang Huaiyu, maintaining his aspirations fresh through time, unchanging like mountains and rivers!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Lin Shanshan's eyes reddened, most deeply moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Only now did she understand her father's lonely dedication, planning strategies over a hundred years - how difficult a thing this was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo secretly marveled at the ingenuity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Although Lin Bufan was in a passive situation, caught in someone else's scheme and under pressure from the powerful reinforcement Zhu Xuanji, he handled people and situations with remarkable skill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He took on the difficulties of the Ning family's grandfather and grandson. On the surface, he was openly discussing his past and explaining the secrets of the Linglong Mirror Wall, but in reality, he was using this to express his aspirations, his past hardships, and how much effort he had put into this opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">This made someone like Ning Zhuo, after listening and drinking tea, unable to help but sigh at Lin Bufan's struggles. He developed much understanding for him, and the hostility in his heart greatly diminished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Lin Bufan continued: "Those with exceptional talent are extremely rare, and I searched fruitlessly for many years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"I took on many disciples, hoping to succeed through quantity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"But until now, only one person has been noticed by the images of several ancient sages in the Mirror Wall, receiving their guidance multiple times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"This is my senior disciple Linghu Jiu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"I am pleased at heart, but I also deeply know that my beloved disciple is naturally lazy and straightforward in nature, especially prone to expressing himself freely when drunk, disregarding etiquette."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"It's both his making and his undoing - 'Seeking Immortals While Drunk.'" Thinking that since Linghu Jiu has such talent and such a nature, I can only try to fill in the gaps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Therefore, I concealed the truth from him and secretly designed a special wine called 'Meditative Brew,' deceiving him into believing that it was the combination of wine and talent that allowed him to communicate with the netherworld and receive guidance from ancient sages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"In truth, as long as one is within the range of the Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, even without entering the underground caves, if a cultivator is noticed by an image of a past sage in the Mirror Wall, they can receive inheritance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Previously, when he saw the Five Elements Divine Lord under the Spirit Concealment Willow again, he had felt something was strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Now hearing Lin Bufan's words, it verified what he had experienced before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Lin Bufan's words should be true.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo was inclined to believe him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">This wasn't because he trusted Lin Bufan's character, but rather because he trusted Zhu Xuanji more. As a divine investigator, Zhu Xuanji's eyes flickered with golden light, clearly possessing the ability to detect lies. He had demonstrated this ability before in the Immortal Fire City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Lin Bufan then turned his gaze to Ning Zhuo, his smile tinged with bitterness: "I thought everything was well arranged."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Who would have thought that when Young Master Ning Zhuo first met my beloved disciple, they would hit it off so well, and he would bring out the Meditative Brew for Ning Zhuo to drink."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Regular wine tasting would have been fine, but coincidentally, Young Master Ning Zhuo also gained the favor of the Five Elements Divine Lord's law body and received inheritance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Getting inheritance while drunk in the cave would have been one thing. But coincidentally, Young Master Ning Zhuo received another Divine Lord inheritance after entering the Small Dispute Peak mansion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"For other cultivators, receiving such gifts would have been cause for great joy. But Young Master Ning Zhuo, with his meticulous thinking and extremely steady temperament, immediately seized upon any inconsistencies once he discovered them. His actions were as swift as thunder, taking my senior disciple directly to find the formation and discover the secret passage to the original mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">At this point, Lin Bufan let out a long sigh, his expression desolate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo sensed trouble and was about to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">However, Lin Bufan continued: "Everyone has had tea, why not try these pastries?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"These pastries aren't my creation, but rather jointly created by my daughter Shanshan and my senior disciple Jiu'er, called 'Flying Flowers and Shattered Jade.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">By now, Lin Bufan had firmly controlled the conversation, giving Ning Zhuo no room to maneuver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo chose to be patient and followed Lin Bufan's lead, taking a pastry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The pastry had a light golden surface with mottled cracks and patterns. The surface was decorated with a sprinkling of white sesame and crushed almonds, visually resembling flowers scattered on jade, classic and elegant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Placing it in his mouth to chew, Ning Zhuo discovered that the pastry had a soft and glutinous interior, with unevenly distributed raisins, tangerine peel, pomelo peel, and crushed almonds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo ate three in succession, finding that each one had a different texture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">This was mainly because the ingredients weren't evenly distributed, causing him to approach each one with new expectations and curiosity about what flavor would come next.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Sometimes it was the sweet and sour of raisins, or the slightly bitter taste of citrus peels, or the crispy texture of almonds. Each bite offered a different flavor, like variables in a strategic layout, unpredictable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The layered texture of the pastry became more apparent after multiple chews, transitioning from soft to a kind of fine stickiness, with occasional surprising bursts of sweet and sour from unexpected raisins or citrus peel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo had an epiphany and began praising Lin Shanshan's innovation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Lin Shanshan hurriedly showed modesty, saying it was just childhood play, a perfunctory attitude toward her father's assignment. She had grown impatient after just making the jade pastry base and sought her senior brother's help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">But Linghu Jiu, being lazy by nature, got drunk while making the spiritual pastries, leading to the uneven distribution of ingredients.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Yet this mistake became a feature, creating the unique character of these Flying Flowers and Shattered Jade pastries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Zhu Xuanji, Shen Lingshu, and others eating the spiritual pastries all had their own realizations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The next moment, Lin Bufan's words confirmed their insights. The Myriad Medicine Sect's leader slowly spoke: "Flying Flowers and Shattered Jade is a pleasant surprise brought to me by the younger generation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"It also tells me that children have their own fortunes and opportunities. As an elder, if I only carefully arrange things according to my own wishes, it might be a form of obsession, and I shouldn't force things too much."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Ah... people's hearts can change."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Once, I took many disciples and taught them to succeed in cultivation for the purpose of pursuing the Linglong Mirror Wall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"But now, I more wish for these younger generations to grow up safely and steadily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"For instance, Young Master Ning Zhuo's visit to the Myriad Medicine Sect is like these Flying Flowers and Shattered Jade, bringing great joy to everyone in our sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Your interactions and encounters with my daughter Shanshan and my senior disciple Jiu'er are like these ingredients combining to form a uniquely flavored spiritual pastry."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Ah, I'm old now, and only hope you all will have good karma and good outcomes in the future!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Lin Bufan spoke earnestly, appearing like a kindly elder concerned about the next generation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly: "Masterful, truly masterful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"I've learned, learned so much indeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Lin Bufan's candid words allowed him to advance even in defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The atmosphere in the reception hall greatly eased. Though Zhu Xuanji and Shen Lingshu had come with imposing pressure and intent to seek justice, at this moment, they both developed considerable goodwill toward Lin Bufan and greater understanding of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Using tea and pastries, Lin Bufan skillfully expressed his philosophy, gaining others' approval while maintaining his dignity and authority as sect leader. Through the relationships between Ning Zhuo, Lin Shanshan, and Linghu Jiu, he bridged the distance between himself and the Ning family, maximally turning enemies into friends!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Truly worthy of being Lin Bufan, truly worthy of being the actual power figure who had managed the entire sect for over a hundred years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">How could the Myriad Medicine Sect not flourish and prosper under such leadership?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo embarrassingly realized that compared to Lin Bufan's social skills, his frequent use of the Life-Hanging-By-A-Thread technique was actually a regression, a lack of progress, a form of laziness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Sect Leader Lin Bufan is truly outstanding!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"I must learn from his example!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"How can I improve in this aspect if I always rely on the Life-Hanging-By-A-Thread divine technique?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Though Life-Hanging-By-A-Thread is powerful, it's limited by cultivation level and can't even be planted in Linghu Jiu without being detected."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"But these social skills are like spring wind and rain entering the night, moistening things silently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Marvelous, truly marvelous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Immediately, Ning Zhuo decided to rely less on divine techniques in the future and focus more on developing his own potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Using divine techniques isn't difficult; what's difficult is achieving mastery without using them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Today, Ning Zhuo witnessed this level of skill and ability in Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Indeed, techniques are limited by cultivation level, but wisdom can be boundless!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
