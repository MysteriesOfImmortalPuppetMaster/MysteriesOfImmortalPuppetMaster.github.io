<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 493: Six-Six Great Auspiciousness</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Liu Er was overjoyed and immediately commanded a formation change. The three generals once again formed into a triangular arrow formation and continued to charge toward the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">They advanced triumphantly all the way to the peak, where they saw a White-Bone Temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The temple door was wide open; a sacrificial ceremony had just concluded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The ancient talismans drawn with fresh blood filled the entire temple hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The remaining barbarian Golden Core cultivators turned their heads backward and silently looked at Liu, Guan, Zhang, and the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Their eyes were already gone, leaving only two bloody hollows that continuously oozed blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Although they made no sound, all the soldiers could sense their resentment, anger, and hatred!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">For these barbarians, the army of the Two Note Nation was the invader of their homeland, an irreconcilable enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Ah!” Suddenly, Liu Er —who was the main general of the Three-Generals Camp —let out a wail and hastily closed his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Beneath his eyelids, a mysterious light flickered, which was a sign that he was channeling his power with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Liu Er took several steps back. Zhang and Guan stood to his left and right respectively, like two imposing door gods, shielding him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Liu Er was breathing heavily, his heart full of lingering fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">All because he had nearly had his eyeballs explode just now. Fortunately, he reacted in time; the moment he sensed something amiss, he immediately used his power to protect his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But for the time being, he could not see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He quietly activated his natural gift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Spiritual Sound Vein Detection!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The next instant, he used four ears to listen, assisted by his divine sense. Compared to before, his field of view was now even broader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">It was as though he were overlooking the battlefield. He “saw” that the Three-Generals Camp had already surrounded the White-Bone Temple. Ning Zhuo was directing the mechanical army and was following closely behind, slashing his way up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Not good! Extremely not good!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Using Spiritual Sound Vein Detection, he discovered what was going on. Liu Er quickly realized that the barbarian Golden Core cultivators had sacrificed a large number of their elite forces. In the end, they even blood-sacrificed themselves. Their only goal was to summon a god!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">A god-summoning technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">This was a type of magic that included many variations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Summoning a benevolent god often had a low cost. Summoning an evil god required a gruesome, very high price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">It was obvious that the god these barbarians sought was no benevolent being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The blood-sacrifice array gradually dissipated, and nothing out of the ordinary appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Perhaps their blood sacrifice failed; the deity did not respond,” Guan Hong stroked his beard and speculated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Liu Er had a very bad feeling. With his eyes tightly shut, two streaks of blood trailed down from the corners of his eyes along his cheeks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">To be cautious, he gave the order: “Let’s leave this place first and let the strategist’s mechanical puppets dismantle this temple.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Just as the soldiers were turning to leave, a voice suddenly rang in their ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“So, it was you who harmed my followers?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The soldiers quickly turned in the direction of the voice and saw a skeleton standing quietly off to the side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Guan Hong’s pupils shrank abruptly. “When did that appear?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He wasn’t the only one; Zhang Hei felt the same. Their divine senses had been spread out the whole time. If the skeleton had not spoken, they would not have noticed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Who are you?” Liu Er asked urgently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The skeleton let out a cold laugh. “The Two Note Nation invaded the Thousand Peaks Forest. By all logic, you must have plenty of intelligence. Since you’ve already fought your way to this area, do you not know my name, the Dice-Bone Demon God?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Dice-Bone Demon!” Zhang Hei snorted coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This Dice-Bone Demon was the object of faith among the local barbarians in these parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He had originally been a skeleton that gained sentience, then used fear to spread his faith, so that barbarian tribes here generally worshiped him and offered him incense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Thus, he not only possessed demonic techniques but also divine powers, his combat strength multiplied several times over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Dice-Bone Demon God stood about ten feet tall, extremely thin, like a walking, deathly pale skeleton.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">His skull was narrow and elongated, with a high forehead and deeply sunken eye sockets. Where his eyes should have been, there were two dice. The outward-facing side showed the single dot of “one.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He had no lips, and as he spoke, he revealed rows of sharp teeth, which was very unsettling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The tips of his ribs were as sharp as swords. His spine protruded, and each vertebra was inscribed with ancient talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His arms and legs were extremely thin and long, with slightly enlarged joints, as though formed by connecting several thin bamboo rods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The aura he gave off reached the level of the Golden Core realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Just a mere Golden Core-level Demon God! Take this spear!” Zhang Hei shouted coldly and charged first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He thrust the black snake spear, pouring into it the pitch-black power of his “Black Wave Overwhelming” technique, resembling a giant python striking with overwhelming force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Dice-Bone Demon God moved lightly, leaping a great distance with a gentle jump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhang Hei shouted again, “Demon God, where do you think you’re going?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He pursued further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Liu Er felt yet another ominous premonition and hastily called, “Third Brother, don’t chase too far!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">But it was too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In the next moment, two more figures suddenly appeared, blocking Zhang Hei’s retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The soldiers focused their gaze and realized that it was two more Dice-Bone Demon Gods!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The dice in their eye sockets showed “two” and “three,” respectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">By this time, Ning Zhuo had led the army to the scene. Seeing this, his heart sank at once, and he instantly realized, “That means there are another three Dice-Bone Demon Gods as well?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Just as he thought that, the mechanical ring on Ning Zhuo’s hand suddenly tightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Without hesitation, he leaped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Almost simultaneously, two Dice-Bone Demon Gods emerged. Their elongated white skeletal fingers clutched empty air, and the residual force was so strong that it tore up the ground, sending dirt and rocks flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">These two Dice-Bone Demons had dice showing the points “four” and “five.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath. Still in midair, he cast a spell at the two Dice-Bone Demon Gods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">A barrage of fire-based spells rained down, destroying the nearby mechanical puppets. Yet the two Dice-Bone Demon Gods remained unmoved, proudly standing amid the sea of flames. A divine radiance enveloped their bodies, offering them complete protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The battlefield changed in the blink of an eye. The barbarian officers had sacrificed themselves, successfully summoning their Demon God. The Three-Generals Camp was under sudden assault from the Demon God, falling into a defensive position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Guan Hong and Liu Er faced a choice: whether to aid Zhang Hei or Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhang Hei was surrounded by three Dice-Bone Demon Gods, while Ning Zhuo alone faced two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Both sides needed backup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Guan Hong immediately looked to Liu Er, hoping he would give an order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A loathing for Ning Zhuo lay in Liu Er’s heart. At this crucial moment, that negative feeling suddenly grew stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He blurted out, “The strategist faces only two enemies, but our Third Brother is fighting three at once. Aid our Third Brother first!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Guan Hong was slightly taken aback, surprised that Liu Er would give such an order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">After all, Zhang Hei was himself a Golden Core cultivator with thick skin and strong defenses. Even if he was outmatched, he likely wouldn’t face mortal danger in a short time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">On the other hand, Ning Zhuo’s cultivation was only at the Foundation Establishment level. He relied on the war formation to gather the army’s power, raising him to Golden Core-level combat strength. With no real physical cultivation background, facing two Dice-Bone Demon Gods was even more difficult than what Zhang Hei faced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“Perhaps Big Brother wants to rescue Third Brother first. After we three brothers gather our forces, we can kill one or two of the Dice-Bone Demon Gods and turn the tide,” Guan Hong reasoned. Accepting this, he decisively followed the order and charged to support Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Seeing Guan Hong arrive, Zhang Hei was also surprised. While fighting off the enemy, he called out, “Don’t come here! The strategist is in even greater danger!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Liu Er gritted his teeth. Hearing Zhang Hei’s reaction only made his dislike for Ning Zhuo grow further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He gripped the Xuanhuang Sword and used his divine sense to send a message to both Zhang and Guan: “I will go save the strategist. You two concentrate on your enemies!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Liu Er directed the Iron Barrel Formation to slowly shift in Ning Zhuo’s direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Although the Iron Barrel Formation had outstanding defense, it had many flaws as well—most notably, it moved slowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The two Dice-Bone Demon Gods possessed extraordinary defenses and charged through the mechanical army with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">With a casual wave of their slender fingers—like blade edges—they sliced mechanical puppets into several pieces. A single breath of cold air from them unleashed swirling snow, freezing mechanical components and drastically reducing the puppets’ speed and combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">In just over ten breaths, they had destroyed more than thirty mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo’s aura intensified once more, but he was not adept at close combat, only attacking from a distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">White Bone Claw!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">One of the Dice-Bone Demon Gods suddenly used a martial technique. White skeletal claw prints flew in all directions, shattering the encirclement and rushing toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo was just outside the formation’s perimeter. Seeing this, he was not alarmed but rather glad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He cast a wood-based spell, summoning vines to ensnare the formidable foe and delay its advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sensing danger, the Dice-Bone Demon God immediately turned back, attempting to rejoin its companion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">But it was too late!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">In that moment, a towering figure used the cover of numerous mechanical puppets to infiltrate behind the Dice-Bone Demon God that remained in the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Shadow-Edge Blade: Night Tiger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">All along, Ning Zhuo had kept this Golden Core-level mechanical puppet in reserve. Only now did it make its official appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Clang! Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Two crisp metallic clashes rang out, and three sharp claws extended from each of the figure’s wrists.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Youming Slaughter Claws!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The claws were incomparably sharp yet dull in color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Night-Stalking Thornback Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Meng Yehu displayed the newly learned technique, appearing behind the Dice-Bone Demon God. Six claws first collided with the white bones, producing sparks, and then sank deep into the Demon God’s body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The Dice-Bone Demon God howled in pain and lashed back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo was ready, at once directing nearby mechanical puppets to shield Meng Yehu from the blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">With a wave of its thin arm, the Demon God unleashed a blast of white wind that obliterated the mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">In an instant, more than a dozen mechanical puppets were destroyed, but they successfully bought a moment’s respite for Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Meng Yehu seized the opportunity to slip back into the shadows, vanishing without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He left behind the badly wounded Dice-Bone Demon God, which tore through ordinary mechanical puppets, venting its fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“What is that mechanical puppet?” Liu Er saw this scene and widened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He was shaken. “A tiger-headed, human-bodied puppet —another Golden Core combatant!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“Ning Zhuo... truly worthy of a powerful clan background,”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Liu Er could not help feeling a stab of jealousy and a bitter taste in his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Daydreaming on the battlefield is not a good habit,” a Dice-Bone Demon God suddenly appeared behind Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Liu Er already had a protective barrier in place. He gave a slight twitch of his wrist, about to unleash the art contained within the Xuanhuang Sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The creature’s elongated bone arm pierced right through Liu Er’s chest. If he had not dodged, his heart would have been shattered by the Dice-Bone Demon God!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Liu Er let out a furious roar and reversed his sword to counterattack fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Dice-Bone Demon God withdrew after being forced back, but as it retracted its bony arm, the five slender fingers—like five curved blades—dealt critical damage to Liu Er’s internal organs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Liu Er felt intense pain and dropped to one knee, spitting blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">This last-appearing Dice-Bone Demon God had dice showing “six” in its eye sockets, evidently the strongest of them all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“Big Brother!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“Big Brother!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Guan Hong and Zhang Hei roared simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Zhang Hei’s muscles bulged like writhing pythons. He unleashed savage power, the black snake spear whistling in a wide sweep, stirring up a great gust of wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The three Dice-Bone Demon Gods sneered and dodged. Though Zhang Hei’s offense was powerful, it was too straightforward; with their agility, they could easily evade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">But then another unexpected change occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Superior-level natural gift—Purple-Beard Dazzling Strike!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Guan Hong had been surging with the Crimson-Face Blood Calamity Sutra, turning not only his face but his entire skin red as blood. Even his long beard glowed red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">But now his red beard glowed purple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">A purple radiance of nobility and brilliance shone on the three Dice-Bone Demon Gods, freezing them in an instant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">In the past, even the Nascent Soul-level Ma Feitui had fallen victim to this move, leading to a severe injury and his ultimate capture by the Three Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Now, since these three Dice-Bone Demon Gods were only Golden Core-level, they could not resist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">They became sitting targets!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Zhang Hei’s black snake spear swept through, pounding them with three thuds. All three Dice-Bone Demon Gods were smashed apart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Zhang Hei let out an ecstatic roar toward the sky, feeling immense satisfaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">“Hurry, let’s meet up with Big Brother,” Guan Hong urged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Zhang Hei snapped out of it and immediately turned around, running back with Guan Hong to Liu Er’s side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Liu Er had his eyes shut. A gaping hole in the left side of his chest left him half-kneeling on the ground, bracing himself with one hand. He could not move and was fully focused on healing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The surrounding soldiers circled him, protecting him securely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The Dice-Bone Demon God had killed dozens of men but failed to breach the formation. With Guan Hei returning, it had to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Guan Hong and Zhang Hei tended to Liu Er while still fighting the Demon God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Before long, the Dice-Bone Demon God lost the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">It had launched a surprise assault and had taken the initiative. Yet it had failed to kill even one of Liu, Guan, Zhang, or Ning, and had itself lost three avatars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">In the prolonged struggle, the Demon God found itself increasingly disadvantaged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Meng Yehu attacked again and paid the price of a broken Slaughter Claw, but still managed to cleave one Dice-Bone Demon God in half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Among the six Demon God forms in total, four had now been destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Only the “five” and “six” remained. Seeing that the situation looked grim, they repeatedly fell back, standing side by side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The Dice-Bone Demon God bearing “six” placed its hand on the other’s shoulder, instantly absorbing the “five.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">It then looked up at the sky and released a powerful suction force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">An invisible shock wave drew in the bone dust from the previously shattered avatars, as well as countless fragments of dice bones, and infused them into the “six.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Thus, the split forms rejoined, reverting to the Demon God’s true body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Compared to its avatars, its true form did not differ much. The only change was a transparent membrane covering the bones, as thin as a cicada’s wing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Additionally, it now wore a necklace of small bone dice around its neck. When the necklace swayed, the dice within clattered like dice cups being shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">“Heaven, earth, and man—essence, energy, and spirit. All six converge, yielding infinite transformation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">“Your greatest mistake was to fight inside my domain!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">The Dice-Bone Demon God spoke with a jarring sound. At first, it seemed like six voices speaking at once, but by the end, they merged into a single voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">In the next moment, the world changed drastically!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Everyone found themselves in a black-and-white space with flat terrain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Above each person’s head floated a white bone die, each side bearing one to six black dots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Some people tried to attack their dice, but it was all in vain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">“Don’t bother trying! The Dice-Bone Demon God has revealed its domain, and those dice are an external manifestation of the domain’s power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">“We must defeat the Demon God if we want to escape.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Liu Er was gasping for breath. After receiving emergency treatment, he was slightly steadier. Enduring his injuries, he informed everyone of what he had sensed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">“Then let’s smash this Dice-Bone Demon God!” Zhang Hei roared, launching himself forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">The Dice-Bone Demon God leaped backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">As Zhang Hei rushed in, the die above his head began to spin and quickly stopped on four points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Meanwhile, in the Demon God’s eye sockets, the pair of dice also spun, revealing one point and five points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">One plus five equaled six, which was greater than four.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">In the next moment, Zhang Hei inexplicably slowed, while the Demon God sped up. This unusual shift enabled the Demon God to dodge Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">It even had enough leeway to circle around and attack Liu Er once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">Guan Hong intercepted halfway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">They clashed fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">The moment they collided, the die above Guan Hong’s head spun to five points, while the Demon God’s dice fixed on three and five points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Three plus five made eight, which was greater than five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">Hence, Guan Hong’s offense suddenly weakened, while the Demon God’s offense rose dramatically, easily overpowering Guan Hong and forcing him back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">Zhang Hei rushed over to help, but it was clear he wouldn’t make it in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">In desperation, he bellowed at Ning Zhuo, “Strategist, hurry and protect my brother!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">Ning Zhuo likewise shouted, “General Liu, hold on!” and then released the Heavy Armor Blood Ape—Dasheng—sending it charging toward Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">Liu Er lifted his sword with both hands, shielding his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="349">A military art—Safeguarding Home Base!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="351">The weapon’s power took effect swiftly, activating its martial technique. Along with the Iron Barrel Formation’s might, Liu Er’s defense skyrocketed to an extreme level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="353">But the next instant, the die above Liu Er’s head spun and landed on one point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="355">The Dice-Bone Demon God burst into laughter. In its eye sockets, the two dice spun and settled on two points and three points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="357">A total of five points, which exceeded one point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="359">After Liu Er’s defense suddenly soared, it then plummeted. Meanwhile, the Demon God’s defense rose dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="361">A martial technique—White Bone Claw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="363">Thud!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="365">Liu Er let out a miserable cry as he was cleaved in two at the waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="367">“Aaaah!” he roared with a fierce will to survive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="369">He immediately discarded his sword and used his hands to push off the ground, dragging his upper body backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="371">His lower half remained in place, with his intestines spilling from his abdomen, trailing along the ground in a pathetic sight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="373">“Eldest Brother!” Zhang Hei and Guan Hong looked on, their eyes red with fury, and charged at the Dice-Bone Demon God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="375">The Demon God was still at the Golden Core level, yet even with Guan and Zhang combining forces, they struggled against it. The Demon God firmly held the advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="377">This was primarily due to the dice’s effect. Each spin left Guan and Zhang winning fewer rolls than losing, greatly weakening their combined power and throwing off their synergy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="379">At last, Ning Zhuo arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="381">He launched a spell at the Demon God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="383">Above Ning Zhuo’s head, the die spun and abruptly settled—six points!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="385">In the Demon God’s eye sockets, the dice whirled and stopped at one point and two points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="387">One plus two equaled three, which was less than six.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="389">Ning Zhuo’s spell power immediately surged, forcing the Demon God to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="391">Ning Zhuo attacked again. His die came up —six points!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="393">The Demon God’s dice ended up at two and three points, for a total of five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="395">Once more, the Demon God was pushed back by Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="397">Ning Zhuo attacked yet again, and his die result —six points!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="399">“How is it still six?!” The Demon God was both alarmed and enraged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="401">Its dice came up with one point and three points, totaling four.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="403">Ning Zhuo kept attacking, and the Demon God kept retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="405">Guan Hong and Zhang Hei were both stunned. “Why does the strategist roll a six every time?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="407">The Demon God was nearly spitting blood. “Whose domain is this anyway —mine or yours?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="409">“This won’t work. I can’t keep rolling like this!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="411">The Demon God’s fighting spirit crumbled as it attempted to flee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="413">Liu Er shouted, “Stop him! Under the domain’s rules, if it loses six times in a row, it will lose itself entirely!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="415">Galvanized, Guan and Zhang gave their all to cut off its escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="417">“No, don’t come any closer!” the Demon God cried in panic when Ning Zhuo lunged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="419">Ning Zhuo —six points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="421">The Demon God —four points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="423">Ning Zhuo —once again six points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="425">The Demon God —three points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="427">Ning Zhuo —six points!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="429">The Demon God —two points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="431">Ning Zhuo had won six times in a row!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="433">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="435">The Demon God dropped to its knees, hands clutching its head, screaming in a frenzy, “How could I lose? How is it possible?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="437">Amid its cries, its entire body collapsed inward, becoming a six-die bracelet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="439">The bracelet flew toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="441">Ning Zhuo extended his hand, and the bracelet fastened itself around his wrist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="443">Ning Zhuo felt as if he were in a dream. All of a sudden, he gained an exceedingly powerful Golden Core-level strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="445">The other soldiers were all stunned, their mouths agape.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
