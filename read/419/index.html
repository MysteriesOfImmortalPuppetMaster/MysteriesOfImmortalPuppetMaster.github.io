<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 419: Healing the Dao Injury</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In comparison, the Red Flower military camp appeared very simple, even crude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The spiked barriers were ordinary; the camp gate was a huge wooden frame; the watchtower was less than half the height of the one at the White Jade military camp. Even the military flags fluttering in the wind had faded, with the lines at the edges blurred, seeming as if they might fall off at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">However, although the camp was dilapidated, the soldiers guarded every critical point, each one devoted to their duty, full of spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo walked straight toward the Red Flower military camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Because the Imperial Physician with the Iron Crutch, Zhang Zhongyi, had joined this lowest-ranked Red Flower camp, whose general's cultivation was the weakest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Stop! This is a military restricted area; take one more step, and you will be detained!" the cultivator guarding the camp gate sternly stopped Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo quickly stopped in place, wearing a smile, stating his purpose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The gatekeeping cultivator listened and impatiently said, "Hmph, another one here to see Imperial Physician Zhang. Even if the lord hides in the military camp, he can't find peace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo kept smiling, secretly activating his methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Divine Ability â€”Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Magic Treasure â€”My Buddha's Heart-Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Combined with his words: "Brother, I have no other way. THe person closest to me is suffering from illness, more painful than if I were ill myself; it's like my heart is being cut by a knife, burning with anxiety. Therefore, I have come regardless of everything to seek Imperial Physician Zhang's mercy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The gatekeeping cultivator's sympathy was magnified to the extreme, empathizing deeply; his expression softened: "Go in, go in. Sigh, another unfortunate person. Really can't do anything with you people!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo quickly cupped his hands in thanks. Just before entering the gate, he secretly took out a handful of spirit stones and stuffed them into the gatekeeping cultivator's hand: "A small token, you brothers guarding the gate have worked hard; please have some tea."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Unexpectedly, the gatekeeping cultivator reacted as if scalded, his face changing dramatically, reprimanding, "What are you doing? What is this! Don't think of bribing us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"We let you in not because we covet your small token, nor because we pity you, but because General Mu is kind and benevolent and has already ordered to open a convenient door for you seekers of medical help."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"You quickly go in; after seeing the doctor, leave immediately!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Through Life Hanging by a Thread, using My Buddha's Heart-Demon Seal, Ning Zhuo actually sensed this person's genuine sincerity; his words had no falsehood, causing him to be secretly surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"I am a vulgar person, a vulgar person! I underestimated you brothers; I have offended you, I have offended you." Ning Zhuo hurriedly cupped his hands in apology.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The gatekeeping cultivators were relatively young; their faces showed anger, feeling that they had been insulted by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">My Buddha's Heart-Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Their expressions quickly softened, impatiently waving at Ning Zhuo: "Go, go, go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo nodded in thanks and quickly walked into the military camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Before leaving, he withdrew all the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After experiencing the affair with Linghu Jiu and the Demon Heart Cave Master, he became more cautious and decided not to use Life Hanging by a Thread casually in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After all, this is a military camp; the armies of the Two Notes Country crusading against the Thousand Peaks Forest â€”who knows how many talented people are present. If his Life Hanging by a Thread is discovered and traced back to him, wouldn't that be terrible?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo entered the military camp and found that although it was dilapidated, the defense was tight; patrols, sentry posts, training â€”all proceeding methodically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"It seems that this female General Mu Lan, although only at the Golden Core stage, comes from a family of generals; she manages the army strictly, quickly gaining the soldiers' hearts, and is very capable in military governance," Sun Lingtong sighed to Ning Zhuo from within the Ten Thousand Li Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">A cultivator came towards him from the front: "Are you here to seek medical help from Lord Zhang?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">After getting Ning Zhuo's response, the cultivator said, "Then follow me. The military camp is a restricted area, not a place for outsiders like you to casually set foot. But General Mu, considering the suffering of you patients, and feeling that since Lord Zhang voluntarily joined, his medical reputation should not be damaged, has given you this opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo hurriedly thanked General Mu Lan, which immediately caused the cultivator's expression to soften, his eyes conveying the meaning "This lad is sensible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Lifting the curtain of the tent, Ning Zhuo stepped inside and finally saw the Imperial Physician with the Iron Crutch, Zhang Zhongyi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He appeared to be about fifty years old, tall and thin, with a high nose bridge, deep-set eyes, a firm jawline; every inch of his skin seemed to have been sculpted by time into iron and steel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">His brows and temples were slightly graying, revealing an aura of weathered vicissitudes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Most striking was his heavy iron crutch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">According to intelligence, he was once an Imperial Physician, and because of his superb medical skills, was highly valued and trusted by the monarch of the Two Notes Country.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">One day, the prince was seriously ill and needed Zhang Zhongyi to treat him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">But Zhang Zhongyi was unwilling, saying that this son of the monarch usually relied on his father's favor, was arrogant and overbearing, bullied others, and damaged the monarch's reputation. Now that this son was suffering from illness, it was heaven's punishment, and humans should not interfere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The monarch was furious and forced Zhang Zhongyi to treat the illness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhang Zhongyi remained silent, preferring to be beaten to death rather than compromise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">It was also his fate not to die; at that time, the old General Mu returned victorious to the court, saw Zhang Zhongyi being beaten in front of the main hall, and after asking the reason, pleaded for Zhang Zhongyi after paying respects and reporting to the monarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Only then did Zhang Zhongyi escape death; even so, he was seriously injured, and despite his medical skills, he was left disabled, able only to walk with a crutch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Even more seriously, he was originally at the Nascent Soul stage but fell back to the Golden Core stage because of this, and could never make any progress for the rest of his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">At this moment, Zhang Zhongyi was sitting on a bench, looked up at Ning Zhuo, and a sharp light flashed in his eyes: "Although you are injured, with some rest you will recover on your own. What illness are you seeking to treat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands: "Imperial Physician, your eyes are sharp as a torch; the patient is not me, but my elder brother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Saying this, Ning Zhuo patted the mechanical dragon at his waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Sun Lingtong then leaped out from the Ten Thousand Li Dragon and cupped his hands to Zhang Zhongyi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">As soon as he raised his hands, Zhang Zhongyi saw the stone skin on his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">After so long, Sun Lingtong's hands had been completely covered by stone skin; previously it was only the edges of his palms, now even his palms had been transformed into stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Zhang Zhongyi couldn't help but slightly change his expression: "This is a Dao Injury."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo's pupils shrank instantly, his heart jumped: "Dao Injury?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Because his mother's injury was also a Dao Injury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhang Zhongyi's expression was solemn; he nodded slightly and took out a bottle of ointment: "Don't say anything yet; apply this first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo was about to take it, but Zhang Zhongyi refused, looking at Sun Lingtong: "Apply it yourself; during the progression of the illness, don't get too close to others or objects; this Dao Injury is easily transmissible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong then urged his mana, mobilized his divine sense, remotely controlled the medicine bottle to suspend in mid-air, scooped out the ointment, and evenly applied it on his own hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Foundation Establishment cultivators could already use divine sense to manipulate objects; Sun Lingtong's main cultivation technique was even more specialized in the Sea of Consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Therefore, completing this action was easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">After applying the ointment, he immediately felt a cool sensation permeating from the surface of his palms inward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">This cool sensation was very strong; the erosion and petrification state was immediately and fully contained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong immediately showed joy, looking at Ning Zhuo: "It's very effective!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo also showed joy: "That's great."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">But Zhang Zhongyi shook his head: "This only treats the symptoms, not the root cause. To truly cure it, we must start from the root to solve the Dao Injury."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo had accumulated strong curiosity in his heart and immediately asked, "May I ask Lord Zhang, what exactly is a Dao Injury? How can it be cured?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He had long sought the answer in books and classics, and had asked many sages and great powers in the Linglong Mirror Wall; this time he was asking Zhang Zhongyi mainly to hear the opinion of this medical expert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">As a result, Zhang Zhongyi's answer was almost the same as others before: "Dao Injury, as the name suggests, is being injured by Dao and Principles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"A person lifts a heavy object, cannot support it, is crushed and injured; this is being harmed by the principle of heaviness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"A person covers fire with his hand, is burned and injured; this is being harmed by the principle of fire."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"This little fellow's hands are being eroded by some kind of principle of the Earth Element. To cure it, we must understand the details and use appropriate methods to absorb or dispel the principle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"So, you need to find this answer first; otherwise, I cannot treat him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">After a pause, Zhang Zhongyi added, "Once you have the answer, come find me again. This illness is indeed rather troublesome. First, you must ensure the answer is correct. If the root is wrong, no matter how good my medical skills are, they will not be effective and may even cause harm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Secondly, after finding the correct answer, you need to find an expert in the Earth Element, who must be at the master level in the Earth Element realm, understanding the fundamental principles of Earth, to create a specific technique tailored to the illness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Thirdly, as you can see, I have joined the army as the military doctor of the Red Flower camp. I don't know when an order from above will come, and we will have to march to the front lines. And once at the front, the military camp as a restricted area will not allow free access as it does now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Therefore, you must act quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo, casting an inquiring glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo immediately understood what Sun Lingtong was asking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Their previous strategy was correct; although they had taken excessive risks midway, they had discovered the answer â€”the Stone Cast Earth Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">But this matter was actually very important.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Why?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Because it involved the Nascent Soul-level existence of the Old Stone Monster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">From the perspective of the crusading army, the Old Stone Monster was an enemy they had to pay attention to, and indeed a very important enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">But at present, neither the Two Notes Country's army nor the Thousand Peaks Forest side knew anything about this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Both Sun and Ning did not want to expose this secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Although Sun Lingtong was injured, he was holding back a breath of indignation. He had stumbled on the stone sphere and wanted to get back up where he fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo's appeal was simpler. The stone sphere at the bottom of the cave was the body of the Old Stone Monster who failed to reach the Divine Transformation stage, and was also the entire wealth of this ten-thousand-year Earth Spirit. This was a considerable fortune!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">As long as he could resolve the Dao Injury, the current predicament of financial shortage would be completely resolved. For a long time in the future, there would be no such hidden dangers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Moreover, Ning Zhuo vaguely felt that the death of the Old Stone Monster might have great usefulness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong did not speak; he wanted Ning Zhuo to decide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">In a few breaths, Ning Zhuo had thought it through and cupped his hands to Zhang Zhongyi: "Lord Zhang, may I ask what is the consultation fee this time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Zhang Zhongyi laughed: "This is hard to calculate; it depends on what kind of principle your little fellow is afflicted with. Only by prescribing the right medicine can we determine what medicinal materials are needed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"And hiring a cultivator at the master level of Earth Element often costs a lot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"In short, it's always right to prepare more consultation fees."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment: "If we can directly invite an Earth Element master, can we directly resolve this Dao Injury?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Zhang Zhongyi glanced at Ning Zhuo in surprise. Although his cultivation had fallen, he was still a Golden Core cultivator. The two in front of him looked young; he did not know their true ages, only that they were Foundation Establishment cultivators. Listening to this, it seemed that the two could invite someone at the master level of the Earth Element.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">That was not easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Anyone who reaches the master level could establish their own sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zhang Zhongyi shook his head: "Even if you invite an Earth Element master, you still need to design the technique according to my diagnostic methods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Thinking that the other party might have an unusual background, he added an explanation: "A Dao Injury is within the human body; many techniques can target Dao Injury but can also harm the body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"From what I see, this little fellow has little sign of any body refining having been practices. If the Dao Injury is forcibly removed, his small body may not be able to withstand it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo nodded to indicate understanding. He continued to ask, "Junior is worried that after we invite the Earth Element master, Lord Zhang will have gone to the front with the army. I want to ask, if I find an Earth Element master and seek assistance from ordinary physicians, how big is the chance of safely removing the Dao Injury?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Zhang Zhongyi stroked his beard and smiled proudly: "Even Nascent Soul level physicians mostly do not have such confidence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"My case is special; my experience as an Imperial Physician in past years has forged my vision and ability."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"At least in the entire Two Notes Country, I don't think there is a second physician who can treat such illnesses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo understood and immediately flattered Zhang Zhongyi: "In this way, it is truly an honor for us to obtain Lord Zhang's help!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Lord, I have another Dao Injury here; please take a look."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">After hesitating for a while, Ning Zhuo finally took out the Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Golden Core level mechanism puppet?" Upon seeing the Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin, Zhang Zhongyi's eyelids twitched slightly, and he re-examined Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He remained expressionless, carefully examined, and found the purple light traces of spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He finally couldn't conceal his feelings and was deeply moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"This is a mechanism with spirituality!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Such profound spirituality; despite suffering such Dao Injury, it can still resist and sustain for a long time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Little friend, is this a protective item given by your elders?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo nodded, couldn't help swallowing, and stared intently at Zhang Zhongyi: "I wonder, Lord Zhang, can such a Dao Injury be treated?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Zhang Zhongyi first frowned deeply, then slowly shook his head: "Too severe; its Dao Injury is too severe. Forgive this old man for being powerless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Ah?" Ning Zhuo's face turned slightly pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Zhang Zhongyi explained: "This Dao mark is related to the Night Rain Dynasty. The Night Rain Dynasty has two major external Daos: one is the Ghost Dao, and the other is the Spirit Dao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Because of the Ghost Dao, the underworld is flourishing, with countless spirits. After people die, there is a great place to go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"The Spirit Dao is the most bizarre and incomprehensible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Unfortunately, this Dao Injury originates from the Spirit Dao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"This is beyond my ability to cure. Even if you find a master of the Spirit Dao, I cannot cooperate with him, because I cannot use normal thinking to understand the principles within."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, was silent for a moment, and said with difficulty: "I see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Zhang Zhongyi revealed a slight smile: "Little friend Ning, where are you from?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo replied: "Junior is from the Ning family of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. In past years, our clan migrated south from Flying Cloud Kingdom, suffered a betrayal from the Six Caves Sect, who went back on their word and almost put our entire clan to death."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"This time, I was traveling outside, wandering the world, and saw the army crusading against the Thousand Peaks Forest. By coincidence, I very much want to participate and contribute to the great cause of the crusade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"However, currently my good friend is afflicted with a strange injury; it's urgent and cannot be delayed. I must heal him before considering other matters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Upon hearing this, Zhang Zhongyi's eyes lit up slightly: "I see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Little friend, if you invite an Earth Element master, you might as well come directly to me. As for the consultation fee, I have a good suggestion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Why not join the army, enlist in the Red Flower camp, and use military merit to replace the consultation fee. You can heal your friend faster and also vent some anger for your family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Under the iron hoof of our nation's army, although the Six Caves Sect is a local power, it will be crushed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Now is the best time for revenge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, shaking his head in his heart, but showing a contemplative expression on the surface: "Lord Zhang, I am worried about my friend and have no energy to consider the distant future. This, please allow me to find the master and then think carefully."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Zhang Zhongyi stroked his beard: "Very well, very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">After the conversation ended, he first gave Ning Zhuo a token, then summoned a young boy to politely escort Sun and Ning out of the tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">It concerned his own life and death, but Sun Lingtong said nothing, cooperated tacitly with Ning Zhuo, watching him handle the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Before leaving the tent, he again entered the mechanical dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">After completely leaving the Red Flower camp, Sun Lingtong contacted Ning Zhuo and asked about his plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ning Zhuo said: "To cure your injury, we must rely on Zhang Zhongyi's power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"But the Red Flower camp is not a good place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Following Zhang Zhongyi's path, we are too passive. We need to turn passive into active."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Sun Lingtong asked: "How do we turn passive into active?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "We still have to join the army!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
