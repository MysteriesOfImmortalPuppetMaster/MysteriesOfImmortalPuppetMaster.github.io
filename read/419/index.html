<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
In comparison, the Red Flower military camp appeared very simple, even crude.<br/>
<br/>
The spiked barriers were ordinary; the camp gate was a huge wooden frame; the watchtower was less than half the height of the one at the White Jade military camp. Even the military flags fluttering in the wind had faded, with the lines at the edges blurred, seeming as if they might fall off at any moment.<br/>
<br/>
However, although the camp was dilapidated, the soldiers guarded every critical point, each one devoted to their duty, full of spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo walked straight toward the Red Flower military camp.<br/>
<br/>
Because the Imperial Physician with the Iron Crutch, Zhang Zhongyi, had joined this lowest-ranked Red Flower camp, whose general's cultivation was the weakest.<br/>
<br/>
"Stop! This is a military restricted area; take one more step, and you will be detained!" the cultivator guarding the camp gate sternly stopped Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly stopped in place, wearing a smile, stating his purpose.<br/>
<br/>
The gatekeeping cultivator listened and impatiently said, "Hmph, another one here to see Imperial Physician Zhang. Even if the lord hides in the military camp, he can't find peace."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo kept smiling, secretly activating his methods.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Ability ‚ÄîLife Hanging by a Thread!<br/>
<br/>
Magic Treasure ‚ÄîMy Buddha's Heart-Demon Seal!<br/>
<br/>
Combined with his words: "Brother, I have no other way. THe person closest to me is suffering from illness, more painful than if I were ill myself; it's like my heart is being cut by a knife, burning with anxiety. Therefore, I have come regardless of everything to seek Imperial Physician Zhang's mercy."<br/>
<br/>
The gatekeeping cultivator's sympathy was magnified to the extreme, empathizing deeply; his expression softened: "Go in, go in. Sigh, another unfortunate person. Really can't do anything with you people!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly cupped his hands in thanks. Just before entering the gate, he secretly took out a handful of spirit stones and stuffed them into the gatekeeping cultivator's hand: "A small token, you brothers guarding the gate have worked hard; please have some tea."<br/>
<br/>
Unexpectedly, the gatekeeping cultivator reacted as if scalded, his face changing dramatically, reprimanding, "What are you doing? What is this! Don't think of bribing us."<br/>
<br/>
"We let you in not because we covet your small token, nor because we pity you, but because General Mu is kind and benevolent and has already ordered to open a convenient door for you seekers of medical help."<br/>
<br/>
"You quickly go in; after seeing the doctor, leave immediately!"<br/>
<br/>
Through Life Hanging by a Thread, using My Buddha's Heart-Demon Seal, Ning Zhuo actually sensed this person's genuine sincerity; his words had no falsehood, causing him to be secretly surprised.<br/>
<br/>
"I am a vulgar person, a vulgar person! I underestimated you brothers; I have offended you, I have offended you." Ning Zhuo hurriedly cupped his hands in apology.<br/>
<br/>
The gatekeeping cultivators were relatively young; their faces showed anger, feeling that they had been insulted by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Life Hanging by a Thread!<br/>
<br/>
My Buddha's Heart-Demon Seal!<br/>
<br/>
Their expressions quickly softened, impatiently waving at Ning Zhuo: "Go, go, go!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded in thanks and quickly walked into the military camp.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving, he withdrew all the Life Hanging by a Thread.<br/>
<br/>
After experiencing the affair with Linghu Jiu and the Demon Heart Cave Master, he became more cautious and decided not to use Life Hanging by a Thread casually in the future.<br/>
<br/>
After all, this is a military camp; the armies of the Twin Rivers Nation crusading against the Thousand Peaks Forest ‚Äîwho knows how many talented people are present. If his Life Hanging by a Thread is discovered and traced back to him, wouldn't that be terrible?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo entered the military camp and found that although it was dilapidated, the defense was tight; patrols, sentry posts, training ‚Äîall proceeding methodically.<br/>
<br/>
"It seems that this female General Mulan, although only at the Golden Core stage, comes from a family of generals; she manages the army strictly, quickly gaining the soldiers' hearts, and is very capable in military governance," Sun Lingtong sighed to Ning Zhuo from within the Ten Thousand Li Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded slightly.<br/>
<br/>
A cultivator came towards him from the front: "Are you here to seek medical help from Lord Zhang?"<br/>
<br/>
After getting Ning Zhuo's response, the cultivator said, "Then follow me. The military camp is a restricted area, not a place for outsiders like you to casually set foot. But General Mu, considering the suffering of you patients, and feeling that since Lord Zhang voluntarily joined, his medical reputation should not be damaged, has given you this opportunity."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly thanked General Mulan, which immediately caused the cultivator's expression to soften, his eyes conveying the meaning "This lad is sensible."<br/>
<br/>
Lifting the curtain of the tent, Ning Zhuo stepped inside and finally saw the Imperial Physician with the Iron Crutch, Zhang Zhongyi.<br/>
<br/>
He appeared to be about fifty years old, tall and thin, with a high nose bridge, deep-set eyes, a firm jawline; every inch of his skin seemed to have been sculpted by time into iron and steel.<br/>
<br/>
His brows and temples were slightly graying, revealing an aura of weathered vicissitudes.<br/>
<br/>
Most striking was his heavy iron crutch.<br/>
<br/>
According to intelligence, he was once an Imperial Physician, and because of his superb medical skills, was highly valued and trusted by the monarch of the Twin Rivers Nation.<br/>
<br/>
One day, the prince was seriously ill and needed Zhang Zhongyi to treat him.<br/>
<br/>
But Zhang Zhongyi was unwilling, saying that this son of the monarch usually relied on his father's favor, was arrogant and overbearing, bullied others, and damaged the monarch's reputation. Now that this son was suffering from illness, it was heaven's punishment, and humans should not interfere.<br/>
<br/>
The monarch was furious and forced Zhang Zhongyi to treat the illness.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi remained silent, preferring to be beaten to death rather than compromise.<br/>
<br/>
It was also his fate not to die; at that time, the old General Mu returned victorious to the court, saw Zhang Zhongyi being beaten in front of the main hall, and after asking the reason, pleaded for Zhang Zhongyi after paying respects and reporting to the monarch.<br/>
<br/>
Only then did Zhang Zhongyi escape death; even so, he was seriously injured, and despite his medical skills, he was left disabled, able only to walk with a crutch.<br/>
<br/>
Even more seriously, he was originally at the Nascent Soul stage but fell back to the Golden Core stage because of this, and could never make any progress for the rest of his life.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Zhang Zhongyi was sitting on a bench, looked up at Ning Zhuo, and a sharp light flashed in his eyes: "Although you are injured, with some rest you will recover on your own. What illness are you seeking to treat?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cupped his hands: "Imperial Physician, your eyes are sharp as a torch; the patient is not me, but my elder brother."<br/>
<br/>
Saying this, Ning Zhuo patted the mechanical dragon at his waist.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong then leaped out from the Ten Thousand Li Dragon and cupped his hands to Zhang Zhongyi.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he raised his hands, Zhang Zhongyi saw the stone skin on his hands.<br/>
<br/>
After so long, Sun Lingtong's hands had been completely covered by stone skin; previously it was only the edges of his palms, now even his palms had been transformed into stone.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi couldn't help but slightly change his expression: "This is a Dao Injury."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's pupils shrank instantly, his heart jumped: "Dao Injury?"<br/>
<br/>
Because his mother's injury was also a Dao Injury.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi's expression was solemn; he nodded slightly and took out a bottle of ointment: "Don't say anything yet; apply this first."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was about to take it, but Zhang Zhongyi refused, looking at Sun Lingtong: "Apply it yourself; during the progression of the illness, don't get too close to others or objects; this Dao Injury is easily transmissible."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong then urged his mana, mobilized his divine sense, remotely controlled the medicine bottle to suspend in mid-air, scooped out the ointment, and evenly applied it on his own hands.<br/>
<br/>
Foundation Establishment cultivators could already use divine sense to manipulate objects; Sun Lingtong's main cultivation technique was even more specialized in the Sea of Consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, completing this action was easy.<br/>
<br/>
After applying the ointment, he immediately felt a cool sensation permeating from the surface of his palms inward.<br/>
<br/>
This cool sensation was very strong; the erosion and petrification state was immediately and fully contained.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong immediately showed joy, looking at Ning Zhuo: "It's very effective!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also showed joy: "That's great."<br/>
<br/>
But Zhang Zhongyi shook his head: "This only treats the symptoms, not the root cause. To truly cure it, we must start from the root to solve the Dao Injury."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had accumulated strong curiosity in his heart and immediately asked, "May I ask Lord Zhang, what exactly is a Dao Injury? How can it be cured?"<br/>
<br/>
He had long sought the answer in books and classics, and had asked many sages and great powers in the Linglong Mirror Wall; this time he was asking Zhang Zhongyi mainly to hear the opinion of this medical expert.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, Zhang Zhongyi's answer was almost the same as others before: "Dao Injury, as the name suggests, is being injured by Dao and Principles."<br/>
<br/>
"A person lifts a heavy object, cannot support it, is crushed and injured; this is being harmed by the principle of heaviness."<br/>
<br/>
"A person covers fire with his hand, is burned and injured; this is being harmed by the principle of fire."<br/>
<br/>
"This little fellow's hands are being eroded by some kind of principle of the Earth Element. To cure it, we must understand the details and use appropriate methods to absorb or dispel the principle."<br/>
<br/>
"So, you need to find this answer first; otherwise, I cannot treat him."<br/>
<br/>
After a pause, Zhang Zhongyi added, "Once you have the answer, come find me again. This illness is indeed rather troublesome. First, you must ensure the answer is correct. If the root is wrong, no matter how good my medical skills are, they will not be effective and may even cause harm."<br/>
<br/>
"Secondly, after finding the correct answer, you need to find an expert in the Earth Element, who must be at the master level in the Earth Element realm, understanding the fundamental principles of Earth, to create a specific technique tailored to the illness."<br/>
<br/>
"Thirdly, as you can see, I have joined the army as the military doctor of the Red Flower camp. I don't know when an order from above will come, and we will have to march to the front lines. And once at the front, the military camp as a restricted area will not allow free access as it does now."<br/>
<br/>
"Therefore, you must act quickly!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo, casting an inquiring glance.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately understood what Sun Lingtong was asking.<br/>
<br/>
Their previous strategy was correct; although they had taken excessive risks midway, they had discovered the answer ‚Äîthe Stone Cast Earth Treasure.<br/>
<br/>
But this matter was actually very important.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Because it involved the Nascent Soul-level existence of the Old Stone Monster.<br/>
<br/>
From the perspective of the crusading army, the Old Stone Monster was an enemy they had to pay attention to, and indeed a very important enemy.<br/>
<br/>
But at present, neither the Twin Rivers Nation's army nor the Thousand Peaks Forest side knew anything about this.<br/>
<br/>
Both Sun and Ning did not want to expose this secret.<br/>
<br/>
Although Sun Lingtong was injured, he was holding back a breath of indignation. He had stumbled on the stone sphere and wanted to get back up where he fell.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's appeal was simpler. The stone sphere at the bottom of the cave was the body of the Old Stone Monster who failed to reach the Divine Transformation stage, and was also the entire wealth of this ten-thousand-year Earth Spirit. This was a considerable fortune!<br/>
<br/>
As long as he could resolve the Dao Injury, the current predicament of financial shortage would be completely resolved. For a long time in the future, there would be no such hidden dangers.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Ning Zhuo vaguely felt that the death of the Old Stone Monster might have great usefulness.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong did not speak; he wanted Ning Zhuo to decide.<br/>
<br/>
In a few breaths, Ning Zhuo had thought it through and cupped his hands to Zhang Zhongyi: "Lord Zhang, may I ask what is the consultation fee this time?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi laughed: "This is hard to calculate; it depends on what kind of principle your little fellow is afflicted with. Only by prescribing the right medicine can we determine what medicinal materials are needed."<br/>
<br/>
"And hiring a cultivator at the master level of Earth Element often costs a lot."<br/>
<br/>
"In short, it's always right to prepare more consultation fees."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment: "If we can directly invite an Earth Element master, can we directly resolve this Dao Injury?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi glanced at Ning Zhuo in surprise. Although his cultivation had fallen, he was still a Golden Core cultivator. The two in front of him looked young; he did not know their true ages, only that they were Foundation Establishment cultivators. Listening to this, it seemed that the two could invite someone at the master level of the Earth Element.<br/>
<br/>
That was not easy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who reaches the master level could establish their own sect.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi shook his head: "Even if you invite an Earth Element master, you still need to design the technique according to my diagnostic methods."<br/>
<br/>
Thinking that the other party might have an unusual background, he added an explanation: "A Dao Injury is within the human body; many techniques can target Dao Injury but can also harm the body."<br/>
<br/>
"From what I see, this little fellow has little sign of any body refining having been practices. If the Dao Injury is forcibly removed, his small body may not be able to withstand it."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded to indicate understanding. He continued to ask, "Junior is worried that after we invite the Earth Element master, Lord Zhang will have gone to the front with the army. I want to ask, if I find an Earth Element master and seek assistance from ordinary physicians, how big is the chance of safely removing the Dao Injury?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi stroked his beard and smiled proudly: "Even Nascent Soul level physicians mostly do not have such confidence."<br/>
<br/>
"My case is special; my experience as an Imperial Physician in past years has forged my vision and ability."<br/>
<br/>
"At least in the entire Twin Rivers Nation, I don't think there is a second physician who can treat such illnesses."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo understood and immediately flattered Zhang Zhongyi: "In this way, it is truly an honor for us to obtain Lord Zhang's help!"<br/>
<br/>
"Lord, I have another Dao Injury here; please take a look."<br/>
<br/>
After hesitating for a while, Ning Zhuo finally took out the Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin.<br/>
<br/>
"Golden Core level mechanism puppet?" Upon seeing the Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin, Zhang Zhongyi's eyelids twitched slightly, and he re-examined Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
He remained expressionless, carefully examined, and found the purple light traces of spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
He finally couldn't conceal his feelings and was deeply moved.<br/>
<br/>
"This is a mechanism with spirituality!"<br/>
<br/>
"Such profound spirituality; despite suffering such Dao Injury, it can still resist and sustain for a long time."<br/>
<br/>
"Little friend, is this a protective item given by your elders?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, couldn't help swallowing, and stared intently at Zhang Zhongyi: "I wonder, Lord Zhang, can such a Dao Injury be treated?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi first frowned deeply, then slowly shook his head: "Too severe; its Dao Injury is too severe. Forgive this old man for being powerless."<br/>
<br/>
"Ah?" Ning Zhuo's face turned slightly pale.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi explained: "This Dao mark is related to the Night Rain Dynasty. The Night Rain Dynasty has two major external Daos: one is the Ghost Dao, and the other is the Spirit Dao."<br/>
<br/>
"Because of the Ghost Dao, the underworld is flourishing, with countless spirits. After people die, there is a great place to go."<br/>
<br/>
"The Spirit Dao is the most bizarre and incomprehensible."<br/>
<br/>
"Unfortunately, this Dao Injury originates from the Spirit Dao."<br/>
<br/>
"This is beyond my ability to cure. Even if you find a master of the Spirit Dao, I cannot cooperate with him, because I cannot use normal thinking to understand the principles within."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, was silent for a moment, and said with difficulty: "I see."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi revealed a slight smile: "Little friend Ning, where are you from?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo replied: "Junior is from the Ning family of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. In past years, our clan migrated south from Flying Cloud Kingdom, suffered a betrayal from the Six Caves Sect, who went back on their word and almost put our entire clan to death."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, I was traveling outside, wandering the world, and saw the army crusading against the Thousand Peaks Forest. By coincidence, I very much want to participate and contribute to the great cause of the crusade."<br/>
<br/>
"However, currently my good friend is afflicted with a strange injury; it's urgent and cannot be delayed. I must heal him before considering other matters."<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing this, Zhang Zhongyi's eyes lit up slightly: "I see."<br/>
<br/>
"Little friend, if you invite an Earth Element master, you might as well come directly to me. As for the consultation fee, I have a good suggestion."<br/>
<br/>
"Why not join the army, enlist in the Red Flower camp, and use military merit to replace the consultation fee. You can heal your friend faster and also vent some anger for your family."<br/>
<br/>
"Under the iron hoof of our nation's army, although the Six Caves Sect is a local power, it will be crushed."<br/>
<br/>
"Now is the best time for revenge."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, shaking his head in his heart, but showing a contemplative expression on the surface: "Lord Zhang, I am worried about my friend and have no energy to consider the distant future. This, please allow me to find the master and then think carefully."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi stroked his beard: "Very well, very well."<br/>
<br/>
After the conversation ended, he first gave Ning Zhuo a token, then summoned a young boy to politely escort Sun and Ning out of the tent.<br/>
<br/>
It concerned his own life and death, but Sun Lingtong said nothing, cooperated tacitly with Ning Zhuo, watching him handle the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving the tent, he again entered the mechanical dragon.<br/>
<br/>
After completely leaving the Red Flower camp, Sun Lingtong contacted Ning Zhuo and asked about his plan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said: "To cure your injury, we must rely on Zhang Zhongyi's power."<br/>
<br/>
"But the Red Flower camp is not a good place."<br/>
<br/>
"Following Zhang Zhongyi's path, we are too passive. We need to turn passive into active."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong asked: "How do we turn passive into active?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "We still have to join the army!"</div>
