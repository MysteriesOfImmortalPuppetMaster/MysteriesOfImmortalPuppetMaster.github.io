<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">A scrawny dead camel was still bigger than a horse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">When Mu Lan said that her Grand Marshal’s Residence still had lingering foundations, Ning Zhuo absolutely believed her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But this did not prevent Ning Zhuo from mercilessly rejecting her once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Mu Lan, having been frustrated once more, could not help but reply coldly, “Then, Military Advisor Ning, go back and tell General Liu Er that there is absolutely no chance I would take a liking to him. He should not harbor such extravagant hopes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo sighed softly, saluted, and took his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">After returning to the Three-Generals Camp, he conveyed Mu Lan’s refusal to Liu Er as tactfully as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Liu Er clenched his fist, indicating that he would not give up just because of Mu Lan’s rejection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He still wanted to continue striving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Liu Er’s overconfidence clearly shows that he still has an unrevealed trump card,” Ning Zhuo understood more in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After that, he no longer helped by running errands for Liu Er and instead said, “Sir Liu, I need to request a few days’ leave.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Recently, an envoy from my family arrived, bringing the latest orders from my old ancestor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“I need to leave the camp to receive him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Liu Er immediately said, “Military Advisor, why go to all that trouble? This Three-Generals Camp is already your second home. It has your support, as well as the fruit of your daily efforts. Why not invite your esteemed family’s envoy to the camp? We will certainly treat him well!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He very much wanted to use this opportunity to draw closer to the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">From Ning Zhuo’s repeated presentation of precious materials, Liu Er deduced that the Ning family was extremely wealthy. He wanted to forge closer ties so that he could gain more support from the Ning family for the Three-Generals Camp and for himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But Ning Zhuo shook his head: “I already mentioned this proposal in my letter.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“However, the family is concerned since this is, after all, Two Note Country. I am currently fighting as a military advisor, which is already slightly out of line.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“If the family’s envoy openly comes to the Three-Generals Camp with support, it may be very difficult to explain to outsiders.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Moreover, Sir Liu, we must consider the current situation of the Three-Generals Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Right now, you also wish to pursue General Mu Lan, which will certainly make you a thorn in the eyes of Shuang Jing and Sun Gan. Under these circumstances, if my family’s envoy openly enters the Three-Generals Camp, it will surely become leverage for them to use against us!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Liu Er was startled: “The Military Advisor is extremely considerate. That makes sense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Only then did he abandon the idea of entertaining the Ning family envoy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo secretly breathed a sigh of relief and quietly left the camp under Liu Er’s eager gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He first met up with Sun Lingtong, then relied on the Ten Thousand Li Traveling Dragon to traverse the void and cross great distances, once again entering the region of the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">In a previously agreed-upon woodland, Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and the stone sphere combined once more to pose as the “Old Stone Monster” and secretly met with Lu Hongtu, the Great Cave Master of the Six Caves Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Fellow Daoist Lu.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The two greeted each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Lu Hongtu smiled: “Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong, you have ventured deep behind enemy lines, willingly braving great danger. You are truly a model for all of us…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Before he could finish, Ning Zhuo unceremoniously interrupted him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Enough with the flattering nonsense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“I have come to do business.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“I will sell all these spoils of war to you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">As he spoke, Ning Zhuo took out one Earth Milk Pure Spirit Pool, three Wise Light Universal Towers, hundreds of White-Plume Light-Dust mounts, as well as Qiong Yu Armor, Jing Guang Spears, Yue Xiang Shields, and many other military weapons, placing them all in the mountain clearing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Spirit energy pool was intact, but the three Wise Light Universal Towers were all damaged. The hundreds of White-Plume Light-Dust mounts had grown much thinner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">As for the Qiong Yu Armor, Jing Guang Spears, and Yue Xiang Shields, these military armaments were all excellent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Lu Hongtu showed a serious, cautious expression. He immediately used his divine sense to scan the whole area and carefully distinguish them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">His Nascent Soul-level divine sense was extremely powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Lu Hongtu was skilled in painting, and his divine sense had been honed over a long period. He could oversee the entire situation and also focus on any single part.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Very quickly, he finished counting the quantity and confirming the quality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He took out a storage bag and handed it to the “Old Stone Monster”: “Here are spirit stones of lower, medium, upper, and a few top grades, totaling around thirty-one million medium-grade spirit stones. Please check them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong also employed their divine senses to examine them. After confirming no mistakes, both were very satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Fellow Daoist Lu, you are straightforward! Maintaining such cooperation is beneficial to both of us,” Ning Zhuo responded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The total price of these spoils of war from Ning Zhuo’s side was roughly thirty million and fifty-four thousand medium-grade spirit stones. On the surface, Lu Hongtu had given about five hundred thousand more medium-grade spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But in reality, if Ning Zhuo wanted to quickly dispose of the spoils, he would surely have been forced to sell at a lower price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Thus, if he truly went about it himself, his actual profits would have been greatly reduced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Cooperating with Lu Hongtu saved trouble and money. More importantly, it avoided meeting the Ginseng-Whisker Dragon King in person. If this was not achieving multiple benefits at once, then what was?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Seeing that the “Old Stone Monster” was about to leave, Lu Hongtu, while putting away all the spoils scattered on the ground, hastily said, “Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong, please wait a moment before you go.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo immediately refused: “Since the ambush, I have been very interested in military strategy books.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“I wonder if you have any intention of selling the ‘Gao Sheng’s Lost Writings’ you possess?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Even if one cannot personally master them, just reading them to understand and study the art of war and formations can help in preparing for the upcoming great war.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">As a military advisor and Ceremolial Officer, Ning Zhuo saw Liu, Guan, and Zhang, the three generals, train their soldiers every day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">After participating in the ambush, not only had he witnessed but also personally experienced the benefits of battle formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Therefore, he became even more curious about this power, developing a considerable desire to study it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Even though Ning Zhuo had long known that “Gao Sheng’s Lost Writings” could sell at a good price, he still wanted to keep it in his own hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Lu Hongtu did not find this statement from the Old Stone Monster strange and fully agreed with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“What Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong says is very true.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“I know well that Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong will not let go of ‘Gao Sheng’s Lost Writings.’”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“However, our Thousand Peaks Forest’s greatest disadvantage against Two Note Country lies in the scarcity of talented generals. We urgently need top-tier strategy books to narrow the gap.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Otherwise, once the final decisive battle begins, our chances of victory will be far smaller than those of Two Note Country.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">At this point, Lu Hongtu smiled slightly, clearly having prepared his speech.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“How about this, Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong, we might as well change our method of trading.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Since you do not wish to sell, we dare not force you to do so.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Why not cooperate?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“We will lend you the Soldiers Sharing the Same Helmet, to help you quickly study and comprehend ‘Gao Sheng’s Lost Writings.’”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“And in return, at the necessary time, please hand over both ‘Gao Sheng’s Lost Writings’ and the Soldiers Sharing the Same Helmet to us, to be used in a crucial battle!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Soldiers Sharing the Same Helmet?” Ning Zhuo recalled a certain passage in the book and immediately became intensely interested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lu Hongtu raised his head and laughed heartily, “Genuine beyond doubt!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
