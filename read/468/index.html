<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
A scrawny dead camel was still bigger than a horse.<br/>
<br/>
When Mulan said that her Grand Marshal’s Residence still had lingering foundations, Ning Zhuo absolutely believed her.<br/>
<br/>
But this did not prevent Ning Zhuo from mercilessly rejecting her once again.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan, having been frustrated once more, could not help but reply coldly, “Then, Military Advisor Ning, go back and tell General Liu Er that there is absolutely no chance I would take a liking to him. He should not harbor such extravagant hopes.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed softly, saluted, and took his leave.<br/>
<br/>
After returning to the Three-Generals Camp, he conveyed Mulan’s refusal to Liu Er as tactfully as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er clenched his fist, indicating that he would not give up just because of Mulan’s rejection.<br/>
<br/>
He still wanted to continue striving.<br/>
<br/>
“Liu Er’s overconfidence clearly shows that he still has an unrevealed trump card,” Ning Zhuo understood more in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
After that, he no longer helped by running errands for Liu Er and instead said, “Sir Liu, I need to request a few days’ leave.”<br/>
<br/>
“Recently, an envoy from my family arrived, bringing the latest orders from my old ancestor.”<br/>
<br/>
“I need to leave the camp to receive him.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er immediately said, “Military Advisor, why go to all that trouble? This Three-Generals Camp is already your second home. It has your support, as well as the fruit of your daily efforts. Why not invite your esteemed family’s envoy to the camp? We will certainly treat him well!”<br/>
<br/>
He very much wanted to use this opportunity to draw closer to the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
From Ning Zhuo’s repeated presentation of precious materials, Liu Er deduced that the Ning family was extremely wealthy. He wanted to forge closer ties so that he could gain more support from the Ning family for the Three-Generals Camp and for himself.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo shook his head: “I already mentioned this proposal in my letter.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, the family is concerned since this is, after all, Two Note Country. I am currently fighting as a military advisor, which is already slightly out of line.”<br/>
<br/>
“If the family’s envoy openly comes to the Three-Generals Camp with support, it may be very difficult to explain to outsiders.”<br/>
<br/>
“Moreover, Sir Liu, we must consider the current situation of the Three-Generals Camp.”<br/>
<br/>
“Right now, you also wish to pursue General Mulan, which will certainly make you a thorn in the eyes of Shuang Jing and Sun Gan. Under these circumstances, if my family’s envoy openly enters the Three-Generals Camp, it will surely become leverage for them to use against us!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was startled: “The Military Advisor is extremely considerate. That makes sense.”<br/>
<br/>
Only then did he abandon the idea of entertaining the Ning family envoy.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo secretly breathed a sigh of relief and quietly left the camp under Liu Er’s eager gaze.<br/>
<br/>
He first met up with Sun Lingtong, then relied on the Ten Thousand Li Traveling Dragon to traverse the void and cross great distances, once again entering the region of the Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
In a previously agreed-upon woodland, Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and the stone sphere combined once more to pose as the “Old Stone Monster” and secretly met with Lu Hongtu, the Great Cave Master of the Six Caves Sect.<br/>
<br/>
“Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong.”<br/>
<br/>
“Fellow Daoist Lu.”<br/>
<br/>
The two greeted each other.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu smiled: “Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong, you have ventured deep behind enemy lines, willingly braving great danger. You are truly a model for all of us…”<br/>
<br/>
Before he could finish, Ning Zhuo unceremoniously interrupted him.<br/>
<br/>
“Enough with the flattering nonsense.”<br/>
<br/>
“I have come to do business.”<br/>
<br/>
“I will sell all these spoils of war to you!”<br/>
<br/>
As he spoke, Ning Zhuo took out one Earth Milk Pure Spirit Pool, three Wise Light Universal Towers, hundreds of White-Plume Light-Dust mounts, as well as Qiong Yu Armor, Jing Guang Spears, Yue Xiang Shields, and many other military weapons, placing them all in the mountain clearing.<br/>
<br/>
The Spirit energy pool was intact, but the three Wise Light Universal Towers were all damaged. The hundreds of White-Plume Light-Dust mounts had grown much thinner.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Qiong Yu Armor, Jing Guang Spears, and Yue Xiang Shields, these military armaments were all excellent.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu showed a serious, cautious expression. He immediately used his divine sense to scan the whole area and carefully distinguish them.<br/>
<br/>
His Nascent Soul-level divine sense was extremely powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu was skilled in painting, and his divine sense had been honed over a long period. He could oversee the entire situation and also focus on any single part.<br/>
<br/>
Very quickly, he finished counting the quantity and confirming the quality.<br/>
<br/>
He took out a storage bag and handed it to the “Old Stone Monster”: “Here are spirit stones of lower, medium, upper, and a few top grades, totaling around thirty-one million medium-grade spirit stones. Please check them.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong also employed their divine senses to examine them. After confirming no mistakes, both were very satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
“Fellow Daoist Lu, you are straightforward! Maintaining such cooperation is beneficial to both of us,” Ning Zhuo responded.<br/>
<br/>
The total price of these spoils of war from Ning Zhuo’s side was roughly thirty million and fifty-four thousand medium-grade spirit stones. On the surface, Lu Hongtu had given about five hundred thousand more medium-grade spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
But in reality, if Ning Zhuo wanted to quickly dispose of the spoils, he would surely have been forced to sell at a lower price.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, if he truly went about it himself, his actual profits would have been greatly reduced.<br/>
<br/>
Cooperating with Lu Hongtu saved trouble and money. More importantly, it avoided meeting the Ginseng-Whisker Dragon King in person. If this was not achieving multiple benefits at once, then what was?<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that the “Old Stone Monster” was about to leave, Lu Hongtu, while putting away all the spoils scattered on the ground, hastily said, “Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong, please wait a moment before you go.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately refused: “Since the ambush, I have been very interested in military strategy books.”<br/>
<br/>
“I wonder if you have any intention of selling the ‘Gao Sheng’s Lost Writings’ you possess?”<br/>
<br/>
“Even if one cannot personally master them, just reading them to understand and study the art of war and formations can help in preparing for the upcoming great war.”<br/>
<br/>
As a military advisor and Ceremolial Officer, Ning Zhuo saw Liu, Guan, and Zhang, the three generals, train their soldiers every day.<br/>
<br/>
After participating in the ambush, not only had he witnessed but also personally experienced the benefits of battle formations.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, he became even more curious about this power, developing a considerable desire to study it.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Ning Zhuo had long known that “Gao Sheng’s Lost Writings” could sell at a good price, he still wanted to keep it in his own hands.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu did not find this statement from the Old Stone Monster strange and fully agreed with it.<br/>
<br/>
“What Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong says is very true.”<br/>
<br/>
“I know well that Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong will not let go of ‘Gao Sheng’s Lost Writings.’”<br/>
<br/>
“However, our Thousand Peaks Forest’s greatest disadvantage against Two Note Country lies in the scarcity of talented generals. We urgently need top-tier strategy books to narrow the gap.”<br/>
<br/>
“Otherwise, once the final decisive battle begins, our chances of victory will be far smaller than those of Two Note Country.”<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Lu Hongtu smiled slightly, clearly having prepared his speech.<br/>
<br/>
“How about this, Fellow Daoist Shi Zhong, we might as well change our method of trading.”<br/>
<br/>
“Since you do not wish to sell, we dare not force you to do so.”<br/>
<br/>
“Why not cooperate?”<br/>
<br/>
“We will lend you the Soldiers Sharing the Same Helmet, to help you quickly study and comprehend ‘Gao Sheng’s Lost Writings.’”<br/>
<br/>
“And in return, at the necessary time, please hand over both ‘Gao Sheng’s Lost Writings’ and the Soldiers Sharing the Same Helmet to us, to be used in a crucial battle!”<br/>
<br/>
“Soldiers Sharing the Same Helmet?” Ning Zhuo recalled a certain passage in the book and immediately became intensely interested.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu raised his head and laughed heartily, “Genuine beyond doubt!”<br/>
<br/>
