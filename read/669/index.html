<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Ning... Zhuo?" Qing Chi murmured, chewing on the name as her gaze remained fixed on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo sighed and slowly approached her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Ghost-Human Clan girl, who had been tense and wary, instinctively lowered the wooden stick in her hand as Ning Zhuo drew closer, obeying a mysterious and powerful inner feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo reached out and gently took Qing Chi's hand, pulling her away from the corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Leading her to the bedside, he sat down and gestured for the others to find seats as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Qing Chi stared blankly at Ning Zhuo, wordless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Turning to her, Ning Zhuo said with a hint of guilt, "I know you have many questions. Don't worry, I'll explain everything."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He began his story from the beginning, recounting how he had stumbled upon the battlefield in the river, accidentally impersonated Jiao Ma, and been misunderstood by Qing Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Then, he described entering White Paper City Lord's domain and discovering through their conversations that he might be the savior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Following his mother's plan, he had aligned himself with destiny and gathered the strength needed to disrupt the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Finally, he had taken a desperate gamble, survived countless brushes with death, and narrowly achieved victory!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">As the group listened to his tale, a mix of awe, sorrow, reverence, and melancholy washed over them, coalescing into countless unspoken emotions. They remained silent, stunned by the weight of his words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Qing Chi shook her head. "I don't remember anything. But... I feel like you're telling the truth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Her eyes were already bloodshot, tears streaming down her face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Ghost Clan Girl pressed a hand to her chest. "When I heard of Jiao Ma's death, my heart clenched instantly, as if pierced through by a thousand iron needles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"And when I learned that my... father, Qing Yan, had detonated his Golden Core to protect us, an endless sorrow nearly suffocated me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"So, the feelings I had for you were never real? They were just because I mistakenly believed you were Jiao Ma all along?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo nodded, instinctively averting his gaze, unable to meet Qing Chi's eyes. But he quickly mustered his courage and sincerely apologized. "I bear a heavy responsibility for your current situation. I'm sorry!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Qing Chi's expression wavered. "Should I... hate you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">She immediately shook her head. "I still feel like you're the closest person to me in the world! This bond makes it impossible for me to hate you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"I can sense... your sincerity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Besides, as you said, this entire scheme originated with the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. We were merely pawns in the Yang Qi Destiny's unfolding, a Human Tribulation targeting him. None of us had any choice in the matter, so I can't blame you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"The Qing Clan's purpose is to safeguard our homeland. Since we seized the opportunity presented by Heaven's grand design to build a Cultivation army and reap such immense benefits, we must naturally pay the price. In this world, there's no such thing as enjoying without contributing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"However, you must swear that you didn't kill Jiao Ma. Nor did you deliberately orchestrate my father's demise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo immediately raised his fingers and publicly swore an oath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Qing Chi shook her head. "We need to establish a Divine Contract before I can truly trust you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The amnesiac Qing Chi revealed a surprisingly meticulous and clear-headed side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo nodded, agreeing without hesitation. "No problem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Although they lacked a Divine Contract scroll at hand, it wasn't an issue. White Paper Immortal City undoubtedly possessed such documents, commonly used for transactions and not at all rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Having temporarily appeased Qing Chi, Ning Zhuo turned to the others. "Once the contract arrives, I'll need to establish agreements with each of you as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Regarding what I've just revealed - the truth about White Paper Immortal City's Ghost Tide - it must remain secret."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"At least for now, we absolutely cannot disclose a word of this to anyone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This was also a specific instruction left by Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin in her Jade Slip message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The matter was simply too significant. Though true, Ning Zhuo was still merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Drawing too much attention would inevitably attract trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Especially since Ning Zhuo was about to travel to the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main headquarters to participate in the upcoming Flying Cloud Assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo needed to seize this opportunity to enter his mother's former cave residence and retrieve her remaining possessions, which he intended to use to save Meng Yaoyin. Therefore, he had no desire to complicate matters further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Previously, the Qing-Jiao Army had forged an alliance with the White Paper City Lord, making them one of the two dominant forces in the Ghostly Black Marshlands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo himself was the Vice City Lord of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Combined with the influence of the Myriad Manifestations Sect...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">All these factors ensured that Ning Zhuo's request was given the utmost attention by White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Within a day, over a dozen contracts were gathered and swiftly delivered to the Ceremonial Barracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Arriving with the contracts was Old Chef.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Old Chef specialized in Dark Cuisine and served as the Spirit Chef of the Vigorous Yang Manor. His spirit food had greatly enhanced Ning Zhuo's soul foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He had once narrowly escaped execution, surviving only thanks to Ning Zhuo's intervention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">To him, Ning Zhuo was his life's savior!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Young Master Ning Zhuo, the City Lord's clone personally informed me of your identity and story."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Hearing that you'll soon depart for the Flying Cloud Kingdom to attend the Flying Cloud Assembly, this old man has come to shamelessly beg for a chance to join your retinue!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Old Chef arrived with his luggage, offering his services to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo accepted. "With Old Chef's assistance, this is truly a joyous occasion. How could I possibly turn away such a talented individual?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">In truth, Ning Zhuo had immediately understood Old Chef's intentions the moment he laid eyes on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The White Paper City Lord had once saved Old Chef's life. Knowing Old Chef was innocent, her clone had still visited his prison cell and urged him to confess to stabilize the military's morale. Old Chef had agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Later, Ning Zhuo's intervention had freed Old Chef from the need to seek death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo greatly admired Old Chef's unwavering loyalty, willing to sacrifice even his own life to repay a debt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">More crucially, Ning Zhuo instantly grasped the White Paper City Lord's political motives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">By specifically informing Old Chef of this matter and actively encouraging him to join Ning Zhuo's cause, the White Paper City Lord clearly had strategic intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"From her perspective, she's unaware of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme. She doesn't know he suffered a crushing defeat and urgently needs time to regroup, meaning he won't target White Paper City Lord again anytime soon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Pressured by external forces, she still hopes to cooperate with me. On one hand, she needs the Qing-Jiao Army's combat strength to defend the city. On the other hand, I can provide her with the most suitable Yang Qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This brought them to the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo's decision to keep this treasure secret until now had proven immensely beneficial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"It's precisely because the White Paper City Lord still needs our alliance that she forged this pact. By sending Old Chef, she's extending an olive branch while also establishing him as a crucial liaison between our factions - a key point of contact."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Though only sixteen or seventeen years old, Ning Zhuo was precociously intelligent and mature, his political acumen honed by life in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He carefully considered the choice of Old Chef as the White Paper City Lord's representative, secretly praising her excellent judgment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Looking across White Paper Immortal City, who could be a more suitable mediator between the two factions than Old Chef?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo used up all the contract scrolls that very day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">With over a dozen contracts signed, the people's hearts began to settle further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Qing Chi stared at Ning Zhuo, her expression complex. "Now, I can trust you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo met her gaze, then swept his eyes across the others present, especially the Qing Clan cultivators. "Everyone has witnessed my sincerity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"My mother left a message in the Jade Slip, instructing me to bring Miss Qing Chi on this journey."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"She possesses divination abilities and warned that Miss Qing Chi's life would be in danger if she remained here. Traveling with me, however, would lead to extraordinary growth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Ladies and gentlemen, I swear on my honor that I will take good care of Miss Qing Chi, helping her recover her strength and advance rapidly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"This is what I owe her."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Miss Qing Chi, everyone, please give me a chance to make amends!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">With these words, Ning Zhuo rose, clasped his hands in a fist salute, and bowed deeply to Qing Chi and the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Qing Chi sat motionless, staring at Ning Zhuo, clearly moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Qing'an and the other core members of the Qing Clan hurriedly rose to their feet, not daring to accept Ning Zhuo's formal bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"How could we possibly accept such a grand gesture from Young Master Ning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"We are truly ashamed to receive such respect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"If not for Young Master Ning's repeated protection on the battlefield, we would have perished long ago!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"The Qing Clan owes its current status entirely to Young Master Ning's guidance and promotion. We are not ungrateful fools."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Now that we have signed the Divine Contract, even without it... would we ever doubt Young Master Ning's character?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Qing'an and the others unanimously voiced their agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">This was precisely what Ning Zhuo had anticipated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Firstly, Ning Zhuo's combat prowess was undeniable, having been witnessed firsthand by all present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Secondly, Ning Zhuo possessed formidable backing. As the Vice City Lord of White Paper Immortal City, he enjoyed the full support of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Thirdly, Ning Zhuo was indeed the young hero who had saved the White Paper City Lord and thwarted the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme! His unparalleled achievements had already earned him the adoration of the entire Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Fourthly, Meng Yaoyin's past acts of kindness and sacrifice, coupled with Wen Ruanyu's promotion of her legacy through the Paper Giant Colossus, had long established Meng Yaoyin as a revered figure among the cultivators of the Ghostly Black Marshlands and the entire White Paper Immortal City. And who was Ning Zhuo? He was Meng Yaoyin's son! This pre-existing foundation of trust in Meng Yaoyin naturally extended to her son, Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo turned to Qing Chi. "Miss Qing Chi, what are your thoughts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Qing Chi gazed into Ning Zhuo's eyes, paused for a moment, then nodded slowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Ghost Clan Girl, having lost her memories, had become excessively quiet, her former liveliness gone. This pained Ning Zhuo, strengthening his resolve to treat her well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">His assurances to the Qing Clan were sincere, coming straight from his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Having successfully persuaded Qing Chi and the others, Ning Zhuo immediately made arrangements to depart at dawn the next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"So urgent?" Jiao Ma's biological father asked, his face filled with reluctance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "With Luo Si overseeing matters here, I'm completely at ease. Besides, I need to attend the Flying Cloud Assembly. The sooner I get there, the better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"This delay has already made me somewhat anxious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo's prestige ensured the group immediately accepted his plan without further argument.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">On the day of their departure, Wen Ruanyu arrived to join them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Having served in White Paper Immortal City for so long, and with such a major incident occurring, he hadn't returned to his Sect in ages. It was only proper that he report back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Yang Sanyan would temporarily replace him, overseeing the Myriad Manifestations Sect's outpost in White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">This arrangement had another consideration: Yang Sanyan's strong-willed nature and reliance on his Innate Talent allowed him to wield Nascent Soul-level combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This arrangement would greatly facilitate Ning Zhuo's efforts to secure future benefits for the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The White Paper Immortal City had suffered heavy losses in the recent war, leaving vast areas of unclaimed interests. The Soul Devouring Sect's secret alliance with the Forgetful River Prefecture had prompted the White Paper City Lord to completely eradicate the sect's presence within the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Wen Ruanyu, having served in the White Paper Immortal City for many years, maintained a complex web of relationships, some deeply personal and intertwined. This was hardly the time to sever ties during this critical period of resource allocation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Yang Sanyan, on the other hand, was perfectly suited for the task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Leaving aside the undercurrents of political maneuvering triggered by the new round of resource division within the White Paper Immortal City, Ning Zhuo led his group aboard the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The group gasped in awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Even Wen Ruanyu, a Golden Core True Disciple, teased Ning Zhuo about his extravagant wealth, remarking on his ability to afford such luxuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Sun Lingtong gave the group a tour of the vessel, while Ning Zhuo assigned cabins to each member.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon boasted numerous cabins, though much of the infrastructure remained incomplete. Despite the sudden influx of passengers, there was ample space for everyone to settle in comfortably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">After just two days of travel, the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon returned to the Living Realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu disembarked and proceeded on foot toward the Prefecture Lord's Iron Stele Pass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">This was the border of the Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">On the horizon stood the Profound Iron City Wall, stretching for hundreds of miles. The three characters "Iron Stele Pass" were carved into the wall like axe-hewn strokes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The wall was cast from Qi-Devouring Iron, making it nearly impenetrable even for Nascent Soul cultivators. Three thousand Armor-Piercing Crossbows were embedded in the battlements, their massive bolts gleaming with a chilling light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The garrison commander was a one-eyed old general, remarkably steady and cautious. He scrutinized Wen Ruanyu's identity several times before finally confirming it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The massive gates of the fortress swung open, and the commander allowed the pair to enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Once inside, Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu wasted no time and immediately used the teleportation array within the pass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Wen Ruanyu didn't need to pay the teleportation fee, but Ning Zhuo paid a substantial sum of Spirit Stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">As the array's patterns lit up, the earth veins rumbled, and the Formation erupted with a pillar of purplish-black light. Within the column, Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu gradually vanished from their original location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The teleportation array in Nine Palaces Immortal City flared briefly before extinguishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu slowly emerged from the array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">They had traversed nearly fifty thousand kilometers and arrived at a majestic city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The city's layout clearly followed the Nine Palaces Formation, with nine hundred and ninety-nine floating black towers hovering in the sky, radiating a faint, mystical glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Neither Ning Zhuo nor Wen Ruanyu had the leisure to explore this Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The two arrived at another teleportation array. Wen Ruanyu stepped forward to request passage to the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The cultivator in charge told them, "You two are in luck. This batch of cultivators has been waiting for three days, and now there are exactly two slots left."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The journey to the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate was far more than a million li. Consequently, the teleportation process consumed an immense amount of energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Moreover, news of the Flying Cloud Assembly had spread throughout the Flying Cloud Kingdom. Many cultivators were actively seeking opportunities by traveling to the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate during this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Wen Ruanyu and Ning Zhuo joined the group, and the teleportation commenced immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The formation erupted with lightning, golden bolts piercing the heavens and vanishing into the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo lost track of time, his vision flooded with blinding golden light that persisted even when he closed his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">When he finally felt solid ground beneath his feet, he had already reached their destination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Leaving the grand hall housing the teleportation array, Ning Zhuo followed the group on foot to a vast plaza.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"The Myriad Manifestations Sect!" Wen Ruanyu's expression was complex, a mix of excitement and nostalgia.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The accompanying cultivators gasped in awe, their voices rising in excited praise and discussion.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
