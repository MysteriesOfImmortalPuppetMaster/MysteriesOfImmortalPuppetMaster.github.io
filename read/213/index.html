<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Speak! Why did you kill Yuan Dasheng?" Zhu Xuanji suddenly spoke, his voice as cold as iron, devoid of any warmth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Huh?" Ning Zhuo's face showed a look of astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Speak!" Zhu Xuanji commanded, his voice like a thunderclap, as he unleashed a tremendous pressure, akin to an invisible mountain, suddenly pressing down on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The pressure was so immense that Ning Zhuo, caught off guard, almost fell to his knees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He staggered, his back inevitably bending, but he did not kneel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Instead, he struggled to maintain his standing posture, a stubborn glint in his eyes as he looked at Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zhu Xuanji's eyes shone with a golden light, his gaze piercing through Ning Zhuo with unprecedented intensity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The sharpness of his gaze made Ning Zhuo feel as if he were completely naked, standing in a frozen wasteland.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo frantically channeled his peak ninth-layer mana, injecting it into the Cloud Shadow Hidden Bud at the base of his tongue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Cloud Shadow Hidden Bud activated, temporarily resisting Zhu Xuanji's penetrating gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">But it was clear that this resistance had a time limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Sweat poured down Ning Zhuo's face as he gritted his teeth and spoke with difficulty, "Yes, I had personal motives."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"I wanted to do business with the Mechanical Fire Monkeys, to expand my business. The Monkey Head Gang was my biggest obstacle. Yuan Dasheng's existence blocked my financial path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"So when I saw him gravely injured and near death during the Fire Persimmon Festival, I harbored murderous intent. I approached Fei Si and obtained a token. Using this identity token, I entered the Monkey Head Gang and convinced Yuan Er to abandon treating Yuan Dasheng. Yuan Dasheng eventually succumbed to his injuries, and I am indeed the true culprit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Heh heh heh." Zhu Xuanji laughed coldly three times, "And what else?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">His questioning was like a cold blade pressed against Ning Zhuo's neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo looked at Zhu Xuanji with shock and fear in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zhu Xuanji's gaze was as sharp as an eagle's, locking onto Ning Zhuo, "Don't tell me you killed Yuan Dasheng for just this one reason! Speak clearly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Confess and you'll be treated leniently; resist and you'll face severe consequences."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"You should understand: if you continue to hide the truth, you know what fate awaits you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"You must know, I am a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, part of the Divine Constable Division."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"If it comes to a reckoning, your Ning family is nothing more than a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Even the Meng family is insignificant!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo was drenched in cold sweat, his face pale, his body swaying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">His mind was in turmoil, countless thoughts and questions swirling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"What has Zhu Xuanji discovered to suddenly interrogate me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"What should I say? What do I need to say?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"How much can I gamble?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Seeing Ning Zhuo hesitate, Zhu Xuanji snorted coldly, increasing the pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo could no longer hold on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Under the immense invisible pressure, he fell to one knee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Seeing Ning Zhuo's defeated posture, Zhu Xuanji asked again, "Where is the Demonic Scripture?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo raised his head with difficulty, his confusion genuine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He truly did not know about any Demonic Scripture!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"I don't know. What kind of Demonic Scripture is it?" Ning Zhuo immediately responded, "I've never seen any scripture, nor have I heard of any scripture."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This was the truth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zhu Xuanji had a strong ability to detect lies; he could distinguish between truth and falsehood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhu Xuanji frowned, "If you don't have the scripture, how did you cultivate your skills? How did you collect your clan members' flesh and blood?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo quickly replied, "Sir, I'm innocent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"I've always been researching substitute puppets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Collecting clan members' flesh and blood for this purpose is quite normal. You can check my research records; they're right here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zhu Xuanji's gaze swept around, and the next moment, he used his spiritual power to retrieve several drawings and jade slips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Indeed, they contained records of substitute puppet research and experiments, as well as many small directions and achievements Ning Zhuo had envisioned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo was naturally cautious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">When he declared his intention to develop substitute puppets, he had already prepared these pieces of evidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Zhu Xuanji examined the evidence, pondering silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo, having reached his limit, spat out a mouthful of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He let out a bitter laugh, changing his posture to sit directly on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He looked at Zhu Xuanji, gasping for breath, adopting a posture of admitting guilt and accepting punishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He said sorrowfully, "This day has finally come. I always knew this day would come, I just knew..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Seeing Ning Zhuo's defeated and cooperative posture, Zhu Xuanji slightly reduced the pressure, giving Ning Zhuo some breathing space, "Are you finally willing to talk?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But this small gesture gave Ning Zhuo a crucial piece of information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth in secret, deciding to take a gamble!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He swallowed hard and shook his head at Zhu Xuanji, "Divine Constable, you know the truth, and I've been exposed, but I can't say anything."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"I'm just a small figure. If I reveal the truth, I will surely die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Hmm?!" Zhu Xuanji raised an eyebrow, "You still dare to resist?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He scrutinized Ning Zhuo from head to toe, "Ning Zhuo, you've come a long way. You should cherish it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo laughed bitterly, "Of course I knowâ€”I've come a long way, and no one understands that better than I do."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"I was born at the bottom, a marginal branch of my family, just a small figure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"I'm like a weed growing out of the mud, rooted in filth and manure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"I have to fight with all my might to absorb every bit of nourishment I can get, just to grow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Even when I learned to control the black market, I knew it was dirty, something righteous cultivators wouldn't touch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"But what choice did I have?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"No matter how foul the manure, if it nourishes me, I must seize it with all my strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">At this point, Ning Zhuo looked up at Zhu Xuanji, his eyes filled with jealousy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Lord Zhu, you will never understand me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"You were born into the royal family, always superior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Your cultivation is at the Golden Core Stage, easily crushing me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Just like now, you only need to extend a foot to easily stomp me to death, like an ant on the roadside."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"But why must someone as noble as you make things difficult for me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"You know the truth, so why make things difficult for a small figure like me?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The more Ning Zhuo spoke, the more aggrieved and angry he became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">His face twisted with a terrifying look of hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"I just want to live well and cultivate properly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"But I have no choice. At critical moments, I'm too weak, with no one to rely on. I have to do some unsavory things to gain others' support."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"I expected you to come for me. As long as you present my crimes, I will admit them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"But if you want me to testify, to be a witness and break the case, I absolutely cannot do it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"You might as well kill me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Because I'm not just one person; I have my family, my friends. I don't want to implicate them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"I'll take responsibility for my actions alone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">With that, Ning Zhuo showed a resolute expression, ready to face death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zhu Xuanji fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, which had been watching the spectacle, now looked puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">It couldn't understand what Ning Zhuo was saying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"What are you talking about?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Though it didn't understand, it sensed something ominous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Because Zhu Xuanji was slowly withdrawing his pressure, no longer exerting it on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but roar, "Zhu Xuanji, what are you doing? You've already discovered him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Yes, the young cultivator before you is the culprit, the one who bombed the Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">However, Zhu Xuanji now looked down at Ning Zhuo with a hint of compassion in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He was Zhu Xuanji, known as the one who sees through and brings peace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He had always harbored great sympathy and compassion for the lower-level cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">In Xuanlin City, he risked his life for a bowl of sugar water from an old village elder to investigate the corruption of the Su family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">In the capital, he boldly told the King of the Southern Bean Kingdom to curb the powerful cultivation clans and actively support talented lower-level cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He was tricked by Li Leifeng before his death, but instead of anger, he felt sorrow and willingly allowed himself to be manipulated to find the most suitable headmaster for the orphanage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He had a natural wariness of the deeply entrenched powerful forces in the Southern Bean Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">But for the lower and middle-level cultivators, he had a deep-seated compassion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Looking at Ning Zhuo, who was sitting on the ground, drenched in sweat and in a sorry state, Zhu Xuanji sighed, his expression showing a rare hint of emotion, "You little rascal, you're too good at scheming. Such scheming will only lead to your own demise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"You clearly have talent, so why are you so eager for quick success?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">His tone carried a sense of disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo laughed bitterly, "Sir, I only discovered my talent after entering the Immortal Palace and finding the puppet's head to be large. Only then did I realize I had potential."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zhu Xuanji remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">In his eyes, Ning Zhuo appeared even more as a pitiful and laughable figure, a victim of fate's cruelty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Ning Zhuo, you have talent, you're an excellent young man."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"I'll give you a chance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Think carefully. In three days, give me an explanation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Remember, the explanation you give will determine your future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Zhu Xuanji clasped his hands behind his back, ascended into the sky, and transformed into a streak of light, flying away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo remained seated, motionless for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The noise grew closer; it was the guards near his residence rushing over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">But what use was that?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Facing Zhu Xuanji, the forces Ning Zhuo had built were like paper, utterly unreliable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Too weak, too weak!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"My strength is still too weak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo clenched his fists tightly, his fingers digging deep into his flesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Lava Immortal Palace, main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was dumbfounded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Even as Zhu Xuanji flew away, it continued to watch, hoping he would turn back and capture Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"You're just leaving?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"He's the culprit, the real culprit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"But why do I feel like you pity him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't understand, feeling extremely frustrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">It had wanted to see Ning Zhuo captured, but instead, it saw Ning Zhuo survive another deadly crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Even the esteemed Divine Constable Zhu Xuanji had been fooled by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Are you really a Divine Constable?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"You must be a fake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">It shifted its gaze back to Ning Zhuo, who was being helped up and comforted by many cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"He's such a good actor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Seeing Ning Zhuo being consoled, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit felt a chill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"This young man is truly cunning and terrifying!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Is he really only sixteen?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Could he be a five-hundred-year-old monster reincarnated?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit grew increasingly wary of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">It warned itself that if it ever encountered this young cultivator again, it must be extremely cautious!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Extremely cautious!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
