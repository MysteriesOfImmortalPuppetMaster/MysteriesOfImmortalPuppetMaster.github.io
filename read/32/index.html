<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gradually figured out what Ning Zhuo was doing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">It disdainfully let out a puff of reddish-brown smoke, certain that the boy’s actions would be completely useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">However, just as it lifted its clawtips to stop him, it gave up on that idea. Suddenly, it felt that sitting back and watching the show would be quite interesting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">It was like playing with a little ant, moving its hand to block the ant’s way. When the little ant saw that there was no way forward and was forced to change paths, it would move its hand again and keep blocking the way, forcing the little ant to continuously change paths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Wasn’t this fun?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo, unaware that he had become a little ant in someone else’s eyes, felt immense amounts of pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“I must succeed. I must destroy my name!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo knew very well how serious this matter was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Success or failure here would decide his own life and death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Even if he didn’t die, as long as he failed, he would face an absolutely miserable end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Could he confess everything and join forces with the Ning Clan?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Not once had Ning Zhuo considered doing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">According to the Ning Clan’s usual behavior, if he took the initiative to confess, they would most likely support him on the surface but suppress him in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">And that support would only be to better use him as a tool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">His life would become extremely restrictive, and all his gains from the immortal palace would be confiscated by the clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Freedom? There was no need to even think about it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“Then, should I join the other three forces?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo shook his head internally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Now wasn’t a good time to join them. Meng Chong, Zhou Zhu, and the others had all faced assassinations. Yet Ning Zhuo, an outsider, had already achieved results in the immortal palace? He would definitely be targeted heavily by the other major forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">A small fry like himself couldn’t bear this sort of attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“My biggest advantage is that I’ve always been hiding my true ability. But now, this ranking stone pillar has exposed me, destroying more than ten years of concealment in the blink of an eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“I can’t accept this!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Under the heavy pressure and burning emotions, Ning Zhuo quickly assembled a simple catapult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He took aim, calculated the distance, and cut the restraining rope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">In an instant, the Thousand Jun Heavy Hammer Platform in the catapult basket was flung forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">With a dull thud, the platform struck the stone pillar violently, landing precisely at the location of Ning Zhuo’s name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Then, another loud boom sounded out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Thousand Jun Heavy Hammer Platform had fallen onto the floor, smashing all the nearby floor tiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Unfortunately, on the ranking stone pillar, Ning Zhuo’s name was still completely undamaged. It was still as eye-catching as ever!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Seeing this scene, Ning Zhuo’s heart sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He clenched his fists and stared at his name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He hadn’t expected that on his second entry into the Lava Immortal Palace, there would be such a life-and-death situation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">If Ning Zhuo’s current body wasn’t a puppet, he would surely have been sweating profusely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">All kinds of negative emotions arose, swirling around in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo couldn’t help but think of his mother’s final words before her death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“My mother asked me to stay safe, saying that if it endangered my life, I should just give up on the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Life is the most important thing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Maybe I shouldn’t have been so greedy to explore the Lava Immortal Palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo suddenly shook his head rapidly, his eyes flashing with cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Ha, what’s going on with me now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“If I had another chance, I would still choose to do the same thing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“With an opportunity like this in front of me, how could I not fight for it? Rather than living such a cowardly life, it’d be better to just die!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Calm down!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Even if the worst happens and I’m really exposed, I’ll accept it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Because this is my own choice!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo quickly adjusted his mood and regained his composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">After calming down, he soon thought of other ideas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“I can’t damage the ranking stone pillar, but maybe the Lava Immortal Palace itself has a way to change or disguise the listed name?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“There are still many places in this maintenance room that I haven’t explored yet.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo began an in-depth examination of his surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He quickly browsed through the workbenches, mechanical tools, and various mechanism pedestals. Some were familiar, but there were many he had no knowledge of.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He went over and touched the door at the room’s exit, but no message sounded in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Looks like the maintenance room doesn’t offer any rewards.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Finally, he turned his gaze back to the five-sided stone pillar in the center of the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Just now, he had tried touching the stone pillar to erase his name – to no reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But after thinking about it again, Ning Zhuo felt that the stone pillar wasn’t so simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He tried infusing spirit power into the stone pillar. The next moment, a thin beam of light shot out of the stone pillar and hit Ning Zhuo’s chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The beam of light turned into an imprint, and after a few breaths, the imprint disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“‘Trial disciple’?” Ning Zhuo had seen the imprint clearly and felt it somewhat familiar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Suddenly, he realized that the imprint was written in the same script as the writing on the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“This isn’t surprising. The Buddha Heart Demon Seal is something that my mother got from the Lava Immortal Palace in the first place.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The imprint from the Lava Immortal Palace hadn’t vanished, but merely disappeared from view.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Soon, a follow-up message sounded in Ning Zhuo’s mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“So that’s how it is! Those listed on the ranking will receive weekly rewards, and the rewards are tied to their specific rank. The higher they rank, the better the rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Weekly rewards… When does the week start?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“It also doesn’t mention what exactly the rewards will be.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Leaning on the stone pillar, Ning Zhuo looked up at his name and sighed internally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“But that isn’t the problem here. If it meant getting rid of my name, I would gladly give up those rewards.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">For Ning Zhuo, the ranking rewards were just icing on the cake. But leaving his name exposed would be a true disaster!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“I have to get off the ranking!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“How can I do that?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“I don’t want my name here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo’s thoughts whirled, but he couldn’t come up with any good ideas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But as he was racking his brain and spurring his thoughts, he gradually felt a very vague, yet rather familiar sensation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“This feeling…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“It’s the Buddha Heart Demon Seal?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo was instantly like a drowning man grabbing onto a life-saving rope. Whether it turned out useful or not, this was currently his only hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He immediately focused, abandoning all distracting thoughts and concentrating solely on the sensation coming from the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Meanwhile, in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo’s body lay on the bed, as if in a deep sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">But in the divine sea in his upper dantian, a majestic treasure seal was gradually lighting up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">It became more and more radiant, and the light emanating from the seal gradually left his body, moving along the Life-Hanging Thread and arriving at Ning Zhuo’s soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo’s soul was in the puppet body, and the puppet body was leaning against the five-sided stone pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">And so, the five-sided stone pillar was now within the Buddha Heart Demon Seal’s range of influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo: “It worked, it really worked!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo exerted his will, and his name finally began sinking back into the stone pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">All this time, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been watching Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo had failed repeatedly to erase his name, then fell into deep thought. This whole process was greatly entertaining to the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Lying lazily on the throne, its gaze pierced space as it observed with amusement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">But at that moment, its movements stilled, and dazzling red light shot out of its eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">It sensed the Buddha Heart Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely agitated. It suddenly stood up and launched itself into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">It opened its mouth and let out a terrifying roar that seemed incompatible with its small and exquisite body. The whole of Lava Immortal Palace radiated blinding light once again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain, a huge pillar of light shot into to the sky, hundreds and thousands of individual beams rushing up to the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The immortal palace trembled, the lava below churned violently, and thick smoke roiled ceaselessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Fire Persimmon City’s City Lord had been guarding the palace and immediately noticed the abnormality. He hurriedly took action to prevent Fire Persimmon Mountain from erupting again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"What happened?!" He was full of doubts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
