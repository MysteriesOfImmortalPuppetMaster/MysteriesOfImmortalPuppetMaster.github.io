<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 306: Meng Chong vs. Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Thieves of the Void Sect!!"<br/>
<br/>
Upon seeing Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu, Meng Chong immediately ceased his breathing technique and stood up.<br/>
<br/>
His face was full of anger, and his battle intent burned like a raging fire: "Good, I've been looking forward to running into you."<br/>
<br/>
"I want to take you all down, especially that mechanical ape."<br/>
<br/>
"Bring it out!"<br/>
<br/>
"I want to dismantle it!!"<br/>
<br/>
Encountering Meng Chong, Sun Lingtong couldn't help but grimace, thinking of the trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Now was not the right time to make a move.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, under the alias "Ning Zhuo," knew that if he and Meng Chong fought and the result was announced, everyone would know.<br/>
<br/>
And once the announcement was made, everyone would discover the hidden truth between these two names, thereby unraveling Ning Zhuo's plan.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was worried about Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Given the current mechanism of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, the likelihood of Ning Zhuo encountering others was high. If he happened to be in the same team with others and suddenly heard the announcement "Ning Zhuo eliminated Meng Chong," it would be quite awkward.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, those accompanying him would surely realize that Ning Zhuo had a deeper connection with the Void Sect, leading the others to inevitably target him.<br/>
<br/>
"Given Ning Zhuo's relationship with him, Ning Jiufan wouldn't harm Ning Zhuo's life."<br/>
<br/>
"Furthermore, according to Zhu Xuanji's temperament and the alliance with the Ning family, they wouldn't harm Ning Zhuo's life either."<br/>
<br/>
"They would, however, certainly eliminate Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"And if Ning Zhuo loses the qualification to compete for the position of palace master, it would be more painful than death for him."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong deeply understood that the Lava Immortal Palace held more significance in Ning Zhuo's heart than his own life!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, Sun Lingtong couldn't understand ‚Äî how could someone as clever as Ning Zhuo be so fixated on the Lava Immortal Palace?<br/>
<br/>
But Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were brothers!<br/>
<br/>
Since his brother was so determined to obtain the Lava Immortal Palace, Sun Lingtong had no choice but to accompany him to the end.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Meng Chong eager to move, with sparks of electricity already flickering on his body, Sun Lingtong quickly raised his hand: "Stop! Meng Chong, you just went through a fierce battle and are seriously injured. Your wounds haven't healed yet. I won't take advantage of you!"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong was taken aback, reassessing Sun Lingtong: "I underestimated you. But it doesn't matter, let's fight."<br/>
<br/>
He patted his chest: "What's a little injury? I've been waiting for this moment for too long!"<br/>
<br/>
"This guy has a screw loose, no wonder he's from the Meng family. Let's go." Sun Lingtong transmitted to Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong's pupils contracted slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Though stubborn, his combat intuition was sharp.<br/>
<br/>
Just by seeing Sun Lingtong glance at Yang Chanyu, he immediately sensed that they had no intention of fighting and wanted to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
Immortal Talent - Wild Sprint Thunderclap!<br/>
<br/>
Lightning erupted, arriving in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, Yang Chanyu: ?!<br/>
<br/>
At the critical moment, the two timely blocked.<br/>
<br/>
After the collision, Meng Chong remained in place, while Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu each retreated four or five steps.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong held a dagger, constantly flexing his fingers. He felt a strong numbness.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu, wearing mechanical fists, stared at Meng Chong with a solemn expression: "This strength is unusual! He clearly is only at the sixth level of Qi Refining, yet I, even with the suppression, feel like I'm facing someone at the peak of Qi Refining."<br/>
<br/>
"No wonder Zhou Nongying was eliminated by him!"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong's entire body flickered with electricity. His eyes were like fire and his battle intent burned fiercely in his gaze.<br/>
<br/>
He grinned, revealing white teeth: "Come on! Attack me quickly!"<br/>
<br/>
"We have important matters, let's postpone this battle." Sun Lingtong still tried to negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
"I won't allow it!" Meng Chong suddenly spoke.<br/>
<br/>
When he said "I," his body had already disappeared from the spot.<br/>
<br/>
When he said "won't," he had already fiercely clashed with Sun Lingtong, sending the latter flying.<br/>
<br/>
When he said "allow," he was already in mid-air, blocking Yang Chanyu's counterattack, then easily returned to the point of attack.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the Immortal Talent Wild Sprint Thunderclap?!"<br/>
<br/>
"What incredible speed!"<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong were both shocked.<br/>
<br/>
Void Traversing Technique.<br/>
<br/>
The two, with a tacit understanding, simultaneously used the signature move of the Void Sect.<br/>
<br/>
Ripples spread in the air around them, which they then stepped into, traversing them through space.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, they both appeared in front of a small door, the one that was the farthest from Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
However, just as they were about to push the door open ‚Äî<br/>
<br/>
"Not yet!"<br/>
<br/>
A bolt of lightning tore through space.<br/>
<br/>
Bang bang bang...<br/>
<br/>
In a short time, the three had directly clashed nearly ten times!<br/>
<br/>
After a series of electric sparks, Meng Chong's figure suddenly appeared ten steps away.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was slightly out of breath.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu's face turned completely grim.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong's tenacity far exceeded their imagination. Although they could temporarily escape Meng Chong using the Void Traversing Technique, the space in the Secret Pavilion was limited and Meng Chong's speed was extremely fast. Once he reacted, he could immediately pursue and attack.<br/>
<br/>
"Why run, fight me!" Meng Chong was extremely excited, "Bring out that ape!"<br/>
<br/>
All along, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had caused Meng Chong overwhelming frustration and obstruction in the trial stages.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong's pent-up frustration and anger had accumulated too much.<br/>
<br/>
That was especially the case during the second stage of the palace trial when it was revealed to him that it was the Void Sect's doing. At that time, his anger was close to exploding!<br/>
<br/>
During the second stage of the palace trial, he was also quite frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
That was because cultivators did not personally enter the field and instead were restricted to controlling mechanisms and some spellcasting.<br/>
<br/>
For Meng Chong, this was not satisfying at all.<br/>
<br/>
He preferred his current situation ‚Äî personally charging in, with fists meeting flesh!<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Yang pushed the door and left.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong followed closely.<br/>
<br/>
After the chase between the two sides had spilled across three Secret Pavilion rooms, Yang Chanyu's face was as still as water: "I'm getting a bit angry!"<br/>
<br/>
"Let's just turn around, attack together, and deal with this brainless guy."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong firmly refused: "No, we have to consider Ning Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu glanced at Sun Lingtong with displeasure: "Hmph, you really care for him."<br/>
<br/>
"Fine, protect me, I need to cast a spell to temporarily seal the space."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong flashed a worried look: "That's at least a Foundation Establishment level spell, you're only at the peak of Qi Refining. If you force it..."<br/>
<br/>
"So, I need a moment to prepare... stop nagging, protect me!" Yang Chanyu interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong showed a serious expression, stepping forward to shield Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Meng Chong charged fiercely!<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been watching the battle and was extremely tense at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Chong, you're too reckless!" It complained in its heart, feeling very worried that Sun and Yang would be provoked to disregard Ning Zhuo in order to eliminate Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
If that happened, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's escape plan would be greatly compromised.<br/>
<br/>
It would be especially obvious since it was clear that Ning Zhuo was currently alone. If Sun and Yang really made a move, the other cultivators in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, upon hearing "Ning Zhuo, Yang Chanyu have eliminated Meng Chong", would most likely speculate that Ning Zhuo was once again under the Void Sect's control.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities was isolated from the outside. Even if Meng Chong was eliminated and knew that the name Ning Zhuo actually referred to Sun Lingtong, this secret couldn't be transmitted inside the pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
"This is actually an opportunity for Ning Zhuo's side."<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Chong eliminating Zhou Nongying might have caused his fate energy to decrease, giving Ning Zhuo an edge and a chance to win."<br/>
<br/>
"Fortunately, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo have a great relationship; Sun Lingtong is too considerate of Ning Zhuo, hesitating and holding back, not realizing the opportunity is right in front of him!"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, as the only observer, had a deeper understanding of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
"Run, Meng Chong, you fool!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit watched with anxiety, its face full of worry.<br/>
<br/>
It gnashed its teeth, pacing on the throne.<br/>
<br/>
"Why, as the palace spirit, do I have such low authority, being restricted everywhere?"<br/>
<br/>
"Alone, I can't even transmit sound!"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit felt aggrieved.<br/>
<br/>
All participating cultivators in the palace trial were implanted with the Life-Hanging Thread. The Life-Hanging Thread was a part of the Immortal Palace's restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
If it could transmit sound through the Life-Hanging Thread, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could use its observational advantage to directly inform Meng Chong of the optimal route.<br/>
<br/>
"If only I could use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal."<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but shift its gaze to the peculiar treasure seal floating in mid-air near the throne.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo offered it, the treasure seal was hidden deep within the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
And after the third stage of the palace trial began, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Jade Dragon Mirror, Golden Phoenix Mirror, and the three tokens of Buddha, Dao, and Demon ‚Äî these being the most important magical artifacts ‚Äî were moved to the main hall, awaiting the new palace master's reception.<br/>
<br/>
And so, beside the Buddha Heart Demon Seal were the two treasure mirrors and three tokens quietly floating around the throne.<br/>
<br/>
"The authority of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal corresponds directly to the palace trial. Corresponding to Ning Zhuo's previous cheating, I only need to draw out a trace of power to possibly transmit information out!"<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit bravely made its attempt. It extended its dragon claw, fiercely grabbing towards the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.<br/>
<br/>
Clouds suddenly surged from the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, blocking the dragon claw.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit failed its attempt to touch the treasure seal's body, then was whipped around by dozens of condensed fire whips.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn you, Meng Yaoyin, I didn't expect you to have this trick!"<br/>
<br/>
"Truly, like mother, like son! I'm so unlucky to encounter you two!"<br/>
<br/>
Boom!!!<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the heavens roared and the Lava Immortal Palace shook violently, like a giant ship encountering a monstrous tsunami.<br/>
<br/>
The originator of this strike was the Nascent Soul level Fire Fusion Demon Ape!<br/>
<br/>
Outside, it was slowly closing its mouth after having completed its attack. The white-hot beam it had spewed had directly pierced through dozens of mechanical constructs, sliced through half of the inner circle of the Immortal Palace, and continued traveling until ultimately striking the main hall of the Immortal Palace with precision.<br/>
<br/>
A massive trench now etched the earth following the path the beam took. Large swathes of the trench's floor surface had been baked into glazed glass by the intense heat.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators, mechanical constructs, and formations along the way were all obliterated!</div>
