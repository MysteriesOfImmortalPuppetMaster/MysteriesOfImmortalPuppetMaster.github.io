<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 306: Meng Chong vs. Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Thieves of the Void Sect!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Upon seeing Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu, Meng Chong immediately ceased his breathing technique and stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">His face was full of anger, and his battle intent burned like a raging fire: "Good, I've been looking forward to running into you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"I want to take you all down, especially that mechanical ape."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Bring it out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"I want to dismantle it!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Encountering Meng Chong, Sun Lingtong couldn't help but grimace, thinking of the trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Now was not the right time to make a move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lingtong, under the alias "Ning Zhuo," knew that if he and Meng Chong fought and the result was announced, everyone would know.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">And once the announcement was made, everyone would discover the hidden truth between these two names, thereby unraveling Ning Zhuo's plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sun Lingtong was worried about Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Given the current mechanism of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, the likelihood of Ning Zhuo encountering others was high. If he happened to be in the same team with others and suddenly heard the announcement "Ning Zhuo eliminated Meng Chong," it would be quite awkward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">At that time, those accompanying him would surely realize that Ning Zhuo had a deeper connection with the Void Sect, leading the others to inevitably target him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Given Ning Zhuo's relationship with him, Ning Jiufan wouldn't harm Ning Zhuo's life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Furthermore, according to Zhu Xuanji's temperament and the alliance with the Ning family, they wouldn't harm Ning Zhuo's life either."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"They would, however, certainly eliminate Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"And if Ning Zhuo loses the qualification to compete for the position of palace master, it would be more painful than death for him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong deeply understood that the Lava Immortal Palace held more significance in Ning Zhuo's heart than his own life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sometimes, Sun Lingtong couldn't understand — how could someone as clever as Ning Zhuo be so fixated on the Lava Immortal Palace?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">But Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were brothers!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Since his brother was so determined to obtain the Lava Immortal Palace, Sun Lingtong had no choice but to accompany him to the end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Seeing Meng Chong eager to move, with sparks of electricity already flickering on his body, Sun Lingtong quickly raised his hand: "Stop! Meng Chong, you just went through a fierce battle and are seriously injured. Your wounds haven't healed yet. I won't take advantage of you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Meng Chong was taken aback, reassessing Sun Lingtong: "I underestimated you. But it doesn't matter, let's fight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He patted his chest: "What's a little injury? I've been waiting for this moment for too long!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"This guy has a screw loose, no wonder he's from the Meng family. Let's go." Sun Lingtong transmitted to Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Meng Chong's pupils contracted slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Though stubborn, his combat intuition was sharp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Just by seeing Sun Lingtong glance at Yang Chanyu, he immediately sensed that they had no intention of fighting and wanted to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Immortal Talent - Wild Sprint Thunderclap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Lightning erupted, arriving in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Sun Lingtong, Yang Chanyu: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">At the critical moment, the two timely blocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After the collision, Meng Chong remained in place, while Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu each retreated four or five steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong held a dagger, constantly flexing his fingers. He felt a strong numbness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Yang Chanyu, wearing mechanical fists, stared at Meng Chong with a solemn expression: "This strength is unusual! He clearly is only at the sixth level of Qi Refining, yet I, even with the suppression, feel like I'm facing someone at the peak of Qi Refining."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"No wonder Zhou Nongying was eliminated by him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Meng Chong's entire body flickered with electricity. His eyes were like fire and his battle intent burned fiercely in his gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He grinned, revealing white teeth: "Come on! Attack me quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"We have important matters, let's postpone this battle." Sun Lingtong still tried to negotiate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"I won't allow it!" Meng Chong suddenly spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">When he said "I," his body had already disappeared from the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">When he said "won't," he had already fiercely clashed with Sun Lingtong, sending the latter flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">When he said "allow," he was already in mid-air, blocking Yang Chanyu's counterattack, then easily returned to the point of attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"This is the Immortal Talent Wild Sprint Thunderclap?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"What incredible speed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong were both shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Void Traversing Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The two, with a tacit understanding, simultaneously used the signature move of the Void Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ripples spread in the air around them, which they then stepped into, traversing them through space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The next moment, they both appeared in front of a small door, the one that was the farthest from Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">However, just as they were about to push the door open —</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Not yet!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A bolt of lightning tore through space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Bang bang bang...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">In a short time, the three had directly clashed nearly ten times!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">After a series of electric sparks, Meng Chong's figure suddenly appeared ten steps away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong was slightly out of breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yang Chanyu's face turned completely grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Meng Chong's tenacity far exceeded their imagination. Although they could temporarily escape Meng Chong using the Void Traversing Technique, the space in the Secret Pavilion was limited and Meng Chong's speed was extremely fast. Once he reacted, he could immediately pursue and attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Why run, fight me!" Meng Chong was extremely excited, "Bring out that ape!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">All along, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had caused Meng Chong overwhelming frustration and obstruction in the trial stages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Meng Chong's pent-up frustration and anger had accumulated too much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">That was especially the case during the second stage of the palace trial when it was revealed to him that it was the Void Sect's doing. At that time, his anger was close to exploding!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">During the second stage of the palace trial, he was also quite frustrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">That was because cultivators did not personally enter the field and instead were restricted to controlling mechanisms and some spellcasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">For Meng Chong, this was not satisfying at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He preferred his current situation — personally charging in, with fists meeting flesh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun and Yang pushed the door and left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Meng Chong followed closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After the chase between the two sides had spilled across three Secret Pavilion rooms, Yang Chanyu's face was as still as water: "I'm getting a bit angry!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Let's just turn around, attack together, and deal with this brainless guy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong firmly refused: "No, we have to consider Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Yang Chanyu glanced at Sun Lingtong with displeasure: "Hmph, you really care for him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Fine, protect me, I need to cast a spell to temporarily seal the space."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong flashed a worried look: "That's at least a Foundation Establishment level spell, you're only at the peak of Qi Refining. If you force it..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"So, I need a moment to prepare... stop nagging, protect me!" Yang Chanyu interrupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong showed a serious expression, stepping forward to shield Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The next moment, Meng Chong charged fiercely!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">[...]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been watching the battle and was extremely tense at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Meng Chong, you're too reckless!" It complained in its heart, feeling very worried that Sun and Yang would be provoked to disregard Ning Zhuo in order to eliminate Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">If that happened, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's escape plan would be greatly compromised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">It would be especially obvious since it was clear that Ning Zhuo was currently alone. If Sun and Yang really made a move, the other cultivators in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, upon hearing "Ning Zhuo, Yang Chanyu have eliminated Meng Chong", would most likely speculate that Ning Zhuo was once again under the Void Sect's control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Yet, the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities was isolated from the outside. Even if Meng Chong was eliminated and knew that the name Ning Zhuo actually referred to Sun Lingtong, this secret couldn't be transmitted inside the pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"This is actually an opportunity for Ning Zhuo's side."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Meng Chong eliminating Zhou Nongying might have caused his fate energy to decrease, giving Ning Zhuo an edge and a chance to win."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Fortunately, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo have a great relationship; Sun Lingtong is too considerate of Ning Zhuo, hesitating and holding back, not realizing the opportunity is right in front of him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, as the only observer, had a deeper understanding of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Run, Meng Chong, you fool!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit watched with anxiety, its face full of worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">It gnashed its teeth, pacing on the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Why, as the palace spirit, do I have such low authority, being restricted everywhere?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Alone, I can't even transmit sound!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit felt aggrieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">All participating cultivators in the palace trial were implanted with the Life Hanging by a Thread. The Life Hanging by a Thread was a part of the Immortal Palace's restrictions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">If it could transmit sound through the Life Hanging by a Thread, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could use its observational advantage to directly inform Meng Chong of the optimal route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"If only I could use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thinking of this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but shift its gaze to the peculiar treasure seal floating in mid-air near the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">After Ning Zhuo offered it, the treasure seal was hidden deep within the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">And after the third stage of the palace trial began, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Jade Dragon Mirror, Golden Phoenix Mirror, and the three tokens of Buddha, Dao, and Demon — these being the most important magical artifacts — were moved to the main hall, awaiting the new palace master's reception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">And so, beside the Buddha Heart Demon Seal were the two treasure mirrors and three tokens quietly floating around the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"The authority of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal corresponds directly to the palace trial. Corresponding to Ning Zhuo's previous cheating, I only need to draw out a trace of power to possibly transmit information out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Thinking of this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit bravely made its attempt. It extended its dragon claw, fiercely grabbing towards the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Clouds suddenly surged from the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, blocking the dragon claw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit failed its attempt to touch the treasure seal's body, then was whipped around by dozens of condensed fire whips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Damn you, Meng Yaoyin, I didn't expect you to have this trick!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Truly, like mother, like son! I'm so unlucky to encounter you two!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Boom!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Suddenly, the heavens roared and the Lava Immortal Palace shook violently, like a giant ship encountering a monstrous tsunami.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The originator of this strike was the Nascent Soul level Fire Fusion Demon Ape!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Outside, it was slowly closing its mouth after having completed its attack. The white-hot beam it had spewed had directly pierced through dozens of mechanical constructs, sliced through half of the inner circle of the Immortal Palace, and continued traveling until ultimately striking the main hall of the Immortal Palace with precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">A massive trench now etched the earth following the path the beam took. Large swathes of the trench's floor surface had been baked into glazed glass by the intense heat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The cultivators, mechanical constructs, and formations along the way were all obliterated!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
