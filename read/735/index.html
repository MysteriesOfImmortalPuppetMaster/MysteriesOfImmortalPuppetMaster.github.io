<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Purple Thunder Peak stood majestically, soaring above a sea of clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This towering main peak was like a coiled, colossal dragon, its head held high toward the heavens. Surrounding it were several slightly shorter sub-peaks, guarding it like halberd-wielding sentinels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Purple Thunder Peak’s mountain body was a deep, somber purplish-black, faintly crisscrossed with strange, uncountable lines that pulsed with a faint yet noble, cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Perennially, a vast expanse of hazy purple clouds shrouded the mountain summit. Within the clouds, streaks of lightning, like violet serpents, slithered and danced - both brilliant and mysterious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Meng Wuyan, one of the Purple Thunder Peak’s Vice Peak Masters, was currently ascending the mountain slope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Even he, to climb the peak, had to proceed one deliberate step at a time, for he was not entitled to use his spiritual energy to move ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Upon reaching a protruding cliffside pavilion halfway up the mountain, Meng Wuyan paused. He folded the list in his hand into a Flying Letter and sent it out from a distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Kneeling before the Purple Extremity Hall, with the Thunder Pool serving as witness, your Vice Peak Master Meng Wuyan, with all sincerity and trepidation, respectfully presents this memorial to the Esteemed Main Peak Master:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"This servant has received your great grace, occupying the secondary position, and toils day and night, fearing only to fail the Peak Master’s great trust and the Sect’s expectations. Now, the first stage of 'Rising Cloud Minor Trial' has  concluded. Heroes have gathered, and a radiant brilliance is emerging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Your subordinate has personally observed and meticulously examined their conduct and abilities. I have found a few disciples, though of different origins - some humble, some extraordinary - who possess outstanding talent, deeply rooted spiritual aptitude, and an unwavering willpower. They are truly unpolished jade and raw gold, destined to become Phoenixes in the future. Allow me to briefly present them to the Peak Master:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"The first, Xiao Cailai. Daughter of a rogue cultivator from the mountains, her spiritual sense is profound. Without cultivating profound Thunder Techniques, relying only on a trace of a meager inheritance and innate spiritual sensitivity, she incredibly managed to predict the trajectory changes of the Seven-Layer Thunder Talismans in the 'Drawing Thunder and Discerning an Opportunity' test with a slight movement of her finger. She successfully drew the most refined wisp of Pure Yang Purple Qi into her body, and a phantom image of a thunder beast briefly manifested around her. This is a natural talent, perfectly suited for the path of Thunder cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"The second, Situ Xing. This child is a noble son from the Situ Clan. He uses the stars as his chessboard and sword light as his brushstroke. His sword art secretly aligns with the paths of the celestial stars. In the 'Hundred Weapons Contention' Rising Cloud Minor Trial, he shattered the 'Nine Luminaries Phantom Star Array' with a single strike. His formidable edge was fully revealed, with celestial stars forming his very bones - he is truly peerless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"The third, Huang Dang. The descendant of a famous general from the Land Walled Nation, his sinews are like iron and his willpower like steel. With a body forged through a thousand trials and the courage of an unyielding spirit, he endured three layers of the Thunder Zone in the 'Nine Tribulations Thunder Path' test. His entire body was scorched black, yet he did not fall. On the contrary, under the invasion of the Thunder Malevolence, he drew a wisp of the Great Earth Dragon Vein Qi to replenish himself, transforming the tribulation into strength. His resilient aptitude is rarely seen in the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"The fourth, Ning Zhuo. Though only at the Foundation Establishment Middle Stage cultivation level and not a Confucian Cultivator, he remarkably topped two consecutive Confucian Cultivation Rising Cloud Trials! Moreover, he triumphed in the Demon Subjugation Hall trial by passing the Three Questions of the Heart, securing the first place once more! For this, he was awarded the Treasure-Grade Merit Pagoda as a prize!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Your subordinate humbly suggests: To win the sincere allegiance of such peerless talents and future stars, one cannot rely on common methods or be moved by vulgar benefits. Only the unique assets of the Purple Thunder Peak - this divine Purple Thunder Dao field, and the supreme opportunity of the Thunder Pool at the mountain’s summit - can attract these exceptional geniuses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Such a world-shaking opportunity to personally visit the sacred ground and directly face the Heavenly Dao far outweighs a thousand Spirit Stones and ten thousand Dao Scrolls! It will surely make them appreciate our Peak’s sincere thirst for talent and its broad-minded spirit. They will know that our Purple Thunder Peak is not only the supreme authority of the Thunder Dao but also the ultimate training ground for achieving brilliance and pioneering the future! With such auspicious omens - virtuous birds choosing their trees, phoenixes and qilin gathering in harmony - the Great Dao's promise is within reach, and the prosperity of Heavenly Peak is imminent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Your subordinate is aware this request may be presumptuous, but for the sake of the Sect and the future, my heart is like a raging fire, and I must speak my mind! I humbly implore the Peak Master to recognize this servant’s absolute loyalty and graciously grant approval. If so, the Sect will be fortunate, and the Great Dao will be fortunate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Your subordinate Meng Wuyan awaits the command with boundless trepidation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"I bow again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Flying Letter quickly vanished from the edge of Meng Wuyan’s perception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Meng Wuyan stood his ground, gazing up at the peak, waiting silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Purple Thunder Peak’s mountain body vibrated slightly, resonating with a long, drawn-out sound, seemingly a dragon's roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The mountain's voice was vast, soaring straight into the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The purple clouds shook. The next moment, their color deepened - neither red nor pure white.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">An intensely concentrated, imperial purple rapidly spread and dyed the purple clouds. This purple was profound and majestic, surpassing all the luxurious silks and gems of the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The imperial purple clouds surged restlessly, becoming thick and imposing. They layered down in an orderly, solemn manner, like an emperor’s canopy. At the center of the purple clouds, a bottomless Purple Minor Vortex Eye slowly opened, watching this world with silent majesty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Even though Meng Wuyan had witnessed this scene many times, he could not avoid the sense of oppression, awe, yearning, and reverence in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Meng Wuyan’s purple pupils narrowed as he watched the thunder serpents in the cloud eye rapidly expand, transforming into numerous phantom Flood Dragons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The purplish intent condensed in Meng Wuyan’s eyes grew even richer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Suddenly, his heart stirred, and he muttered, "It’s coming."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Crack! A magnificent Heavenly Thunder struck down from the core of the vortex eye!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The light of the thunder was so dense it seemed to condense the will of Heaven and Earth. Its core was a blinding white sharpness, while its edges flowed with purple starlight that could melt the very constellations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">It judged Yin and Yang, regulated the cosmos, rewarded and punished all things - supreme majesty!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The tail of the thunderbolt slammed onto the Purple Thunder Peak’s indestructible granite core!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Boom!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">It was a deafening roar, as if the very framework of the world had been shaken. The rock face that was struck instantly melted into a purple jade glaze. Then, the lightning transformed into a surging torrent of light, rushing down the mountain body like a flood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Wherever the imperial purple current flowed, it instantly activated the veins of lightning on the mountain body, which were like blood vessels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">A billion lightning veins lit up, resembling a host of dragons crisscrossing; but in a flash, they dimmed as the current passed. Yet, that split-second spectacle was enough to completely shake Meng Wuyan, bringing tears to the eyes of the powerful Nascent Soul-stage demon cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"The profound secrets of the Great Dao of Thunder are all here, all here!" he cried out in his heart, deeply shaken and moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It was an emotion that made his entire being tremble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">To hear the Dao in the morning, one may die content in the evening!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">With just one thunder strike, the imperial purple quickly receded. The thunder clouds faded, reverting to the prior pale purple mist, lazily floating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Divine Purple Minor Thunder that had just torn through the sky and shaken the universe, that overwhelming pressure of the Heavenly Dao, all seemed like a grand, fleeting illusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Meng Wuyan remained standing with his hands clasped in the pavilion. His dark cyan robes gently flapped in the breeze, no longer snapping violently as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">His agitated heart gradually calmed down. Then, a small white light flew down from the mountaintop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">The white light landed in Meng Wuyan’s hand, reverting to a Flying Letter - the very one he had sent out earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">Meng Wuyan poured his divine sense into the letter, immediately looking toward the blank space at the end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Not a single word was written; no seal was imprinted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">His heart skipped an almost imperceptible beat. In the depths of his eyes, a deep disappointment surged. This was followed by a worry for the future that wrapped around his heart like creeping vines. Furthermore, a hint of ineffable weariness quietly crept onto his brow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">Meng Wuyan was silent for a few breaths. Then, he slowly put away the Flying Letter. He looked up again, as if he could see the Purple Thunder Pool at the summit and the Purple Extremity Hall beside it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">The mountain wind caught a few wisps of hair near his temples. Finally, he sighed softly, raised both arms, bowed deeply, and slowly turned around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">Step by step, he walked heavily and silently toward the descending path, his figure quickly swallowed by the surrounding mountain rocks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">In the Main Hall of the Demon Subjugation Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">The palace was vast and magnificent, yet possessed an imposing, chilling aura. The huge, icy stone tiles were a deep white. Massive iron pillars supported the dome, and the walls were carved with colossal, solemn talismans for suppressing and executing demons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Zhong Dao sat upright behind the giant iron desk at the head of the hall. His broad shoulders and back were ramrod straight, like a lone peak standing firm. The edge of the desk was sharp, just like his angular personality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">After handling a scroll in his hand, Zhong Dao’s sharp eyes could not hide the icy fury within. He looked towards the empty space in front of the massive hall, as if he wanted to burn through the intangible air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">"Petty, self-serving fools! Occupying high positions and achieving nothing!" Recalling the discussion he had just had with the main peak’s senior leadership after his divine sense was summoned into the grand formation, Zhong Dao grew increasingly furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">His heart was congested with frustration, and his past experiences in the officialdom of the Flying Cloud Nation surfaced in his mind again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Those selfish desires hidden beneath a façade of grandeur, those open and secret struggles above the rules…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Wherever there are people, there is conflict, and the Myriad Manifestations Sect was no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">A deep disappointment and an indescribable sense of indignant isolation transformed into icy cold tides, spreading from the depths of his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">His straight back seemed harder than iron, and the deep vertical furrow between his brows revealed the force of a knife-carved melancholy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">The atmosphere in the hall was heavy and oppressive. The guarding cultivators hardly dared to breathe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">The captain of the guards sighed secretly. After a moment's thought, he gently stepped out of formation. He took out a jade slip from his robes: "Hall Master Zhong, your subordinate has something to report. The Rising Cloud Minor Trial has reached the first phase. One hall has announced a first-place winner and awarded the Treasure-Grade Merit Pagoda as a prize."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Zhong Dao’s expression slightly paused. He naturally understood what a Treasure-Grade first-place prize signified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">"This person passed the Three Questions of the Heart?" His gaze fixed on the guard captain, instantly placing immense psychological pressure on the latter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">The guard captain subconsciously lowered his head, his voice becoming clearer and louder: "Your Honor is correct. This person is named Ning Zhuo, a fledgling talent. When answering the three questions, he did not avoid them, and his attitude was resolute. When asked the final question, he bluntly stated, 'What difference does it make? What is there to fear!'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">"Oh." Upon hearing this, the deep vertical furrow on Zhong Dao’s brow subtly relaxed a fraction. The icy fury in his eyes also diminished slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">"To possess such realization and such willpower is commendable," Zhong Dao thought of himself. "Is there any intelligence gathered?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">This was only natural.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">If a cultivator won first place in the first phase of the Rising Cloud Minor Test, the Demon Subjugation Hall would naturally launch a thorough investigation to strictly guard against a demonic cultivator disguising themselves and infiltrating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">The guard captain was highly sensitive to the atmosphere. Seeing that Zhong Dao’s anger had subsided somewhat, he also felt secretly delighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">He continued, "The investigation is still ongoing. Ning Zhuo appears not to be from the Flying Cloud Nation. However, according to the latest intelligence, he has already exchanged for a Stone Plaque."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Zhong Dao said, "Oh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">His brows relaxed further: "It seems this child has a promising future, and his talent should rank among the best in this session of the Flying Cloud Grand Assembly. If the situation is true, he is somewhat… similar to me when I was young."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">"It appears the cultivation world… is not entirely made up of petty, self-serving individuals. The Righteous Path is not without successors. New talents will eventually inherit the will of our generation and safeguard the Righteous Path. There are those with iron backbones who shoulder the Dao and those with sincere hearts whose deeds are worthy of history."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Zhong Dao nodded slightly. With much of his frustration resolved, he immediately ordered a thorough investigation into Ning Zhuo, emphasizing the need to uncover all information about him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">The guard captain felt relieved that Zhong Dao's displeasure had ceased. He was also happy to be able to share his superior’s burden and quietly returned to his post.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Zhong Dao was about to process the next scroll when he suddenly looked up at the guard captain, who was halfway back: "What kind of Rising Cloud Minor Trials were the first two times Ning Zhuo won first place?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">The guard captain immediately stopped, took a few steps forward again, and reported respectfully: "They were both Confucian Cultivation Minor Trials. Furthermore, Ning Zhuo is not a Confucian Cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">"Oh?" Hearing this somewhat surprising answer, Zhong Dao developed a new degree of interest in Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">Zhong Dao was very familiar with the conduct of Confucian Cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">"To achieve first place in a Confucian Cultivation Minor Trial as an outsider shows that this child’s character is upright."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">"Good, very good," Zhong Dao nodded, murmuring softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">He waved his hand at the guard captain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">The guard captain bowed and retreated, returning to his post. He thought: After this incident, my superior will likely have a great impression of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">"If I run into Ning Zhuo in the future, just for today, I’ll have to make him treat me to a meal," the guard captain thought. His initial thought was not this, but it didn't stop him from secretly envying Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">Zhong Dao's cultivation, combat power, and prestige were immense. To be valued by him, as a newcomer, would save Ning Zhuo countless detours.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Zhong Dao buried his head in a scroll, processing it with noticeably higher efficiency than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Taking advantage of a moment of leisure, he recalled the recent discussion among the main peaks, and a streak of cold light flashed in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">"They want to make a move on Wen Ruanyu. Qin De is the key."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">"We must strictly monitor this person and contact Di Zizhang to warn him of the main peak's schemes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Thinking this, Zhong Dao immediately wrote a Flying Message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">The letter contained only one line: My desires and my duty are mutually exclusive. Can Brother Di Zizhang sacrifice his personal desires for the sake of justice?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">He and Di Zizhang had long been good friends, and such a short sentence was sufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">In another Cave Estate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Ban Ji’s face was ashen, staring intently at the jade plaque in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">The jade plaque was an artifact used for communication, but no matter how Ban Ji urged it, there was no response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">He had lost contact with Lady Spiderweb and could not reach her at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">"But Che Zhuzi is still alive… I'm afraid Lady Spiderweb is more likely to be in danger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"In that case, how much intelligence has Ning Zhuo obtained? Has he already detected me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">"Damn it!" Ban Ji clenched his fist, his eyes flashing with hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">He knew clearly that Ning Zhuo had exchanged for a Stone Plaque, which was even earlier than him. Currently, Ban Ji had only won first place in two tests and still needed a third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">"I can’t rely on Lady Spiderweb, but what about the others?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">"The Reckless Monk, Rust Disaster Craftsman, Liu Qingyan - what exactly are those few doing? Can they not perform even a little service?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">In the Ban Clan’s ancestral hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Clatter, clatter…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">A vast mechanical construct, which nearly filled the entire hall, suddenly emitted an alarming noise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Under normal circumstances, the slowly moving wooden blocks began to fall one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">The supervising cultivators noticed the anomaly, took it very seriously, and immediately began an inspection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">"It’s a problem on Ban Ji's side!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">"What on earth happened to him? Who did he provoke?" How could his fortune be suppressed so violently?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">"Investigate! Find out what happened immediately!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">The rear hall of the Ancestral Hall instantly descended into a frenzy of activity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
