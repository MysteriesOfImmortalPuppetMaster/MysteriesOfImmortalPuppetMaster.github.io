<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Ning Clan cultivators in the prison cell were immersed in discussion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The “Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation” transmitted by the bell only contained the first three levels. But even within just these first three levels, everyone seemed to have comprehended different things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">For example, there was a section about condensing metal qi. To one person, it sounded like this: “Metal qi enters the palms, seeps into the meridians, flows into the lungs, and nourishes the organs. A suitable cultivator will have a broad mentality and unhurried breath. Metal qi is dry in nature, and improper usage will harm the lungs.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Another person heard this: “Metal qi enters the palm… A suitable cultivator will have a wild mentality and hasty breath. Metal qi is sharp and strong. The master must kill decisively, always moving forward.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The first interpretation required a cultivator to cultivate slowly and steadily, whereas the second encouraged them to forge ahead with bravery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Although everyone had listened to the same bell sound, what they got out of it was different. And so, they argued ceaselessly with each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“It seems that you don’t understand the Technique Transmission Bell.” Soon, Chi Dun appeared with Ning Chen and Ning Yong in tow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">At this point, he had interrogated every Ning Clan cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">All the Ning Clan cultivators looked over. One of them bowed and said, “Please enlighten us, Sir Chi Dun.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo smiled at Ning Chen and Ning Yong. However, the two didn’t dare to look him in the eye. During the interrogation just now, they had admitted to everything, including the way they had acted under Ning Zhanji’s orders to trick Ning Zhuo into entering the cavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Chi Dun explained, “The Technique Transmission Bell is as the name suggests – a bell for transmitting techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Because its techniques are transmitted via sound, those who speak different languages and even creatures of different species can all understand them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Three Schools Supreme Sage bears mercy toward all living things. Thus, the Technique Transmission Bell he left behind can help not only humans, but all other beings as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“There are good and bad Technique Transmission Bells. For ordinary bells, the techniques transmitted through the sound are all the same. But for an outstanding bell, the transmitted techniques will vary from person to person.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Most of the cultivators were shocked, but a few had thoughtful looks on their faces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Chi Dun continued, “The techniques that each of you obtained are all correct. That’s because they have been adjusted to suit you based on your own personal characteristics.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“So that’s how it is!” The cultivators all showed pleasant surprise as understanding dawned on them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“A cultivation technique is just a method of absorbing external energy for our own use. All cultivation techniques can be constantly modified.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Yeah. Ancient cultivation techniques find it hard to compete with modern ones because the external environment is always changing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Three Schools Supreme Sage really is compassionate, looking after every one of us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Chi Dun said, “This is in line with Buddhist teachings. Buddhism is best at conversion – refining external magical power and turning it into corresponding Buddhist power. As the saying goes, ‘Put down your butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot’ – even for demonic cultivators, the magical power they have accumulated for many years can easily turn into Buddhist magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“However, you shouldn’t overestimate the effects of the bell. It has its limit. Since it’s taken into account all beings in the city, the individual adjustments are definitely limited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Thus, the cultivation technique you received from the bell is by no means perfect. As you practice, you can continuously try to improve it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Ning Clan cultivators looked at each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">One of them smiled bitterly and said, “Improving cultivation techniques is too difficult! Sir Chi Dun, you really overestimate us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Another added, “Those who can modify cultivation techniques either have a deep understanding of the technique or are extraordinarily talented. We’re not capable of doing it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Of course, Chi Dun already knew this. He had only reminded them as a show of goodwill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Alright, all of you are cleared of suspicion. Follow me, and stop taking up space in the dungeon.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Him personally releasing the Ning Clan cultivators was an intentional gesture to show his stance to the Ning Clan. He wanted to tell them that his interrogation of the Ning Clan’s people was merely carrying out orders and not of his own will.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Ning Clan cultivators thanked Chi Dun and followed him out of the cell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As they walked out of the dungeon and saw the rising sun, the alarm bell on Chi Dun’s body suddenly burst into a clamor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Chi Dun’s expression changed. His aura surged as he flew out following the guidance of the alarm bell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The wind generated by his takeoff was so strong that the surrounding Ning Clan cultivators were directly blown away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">There was a loud sound, and the ground trembled, kicking up a cloud of dust. A dark figure shot out from the dust cloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Ning Clan cultivators all exclaimed, “It’s the black shadow demonic cultivator!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Bold little villain, you dare spy on the dungeon?!” Chi Dun was absolutely furious and chased after the black shadow demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The black shadow demonic cultivator laughed mockingly in a hoarse voice, retreating while fighting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The two people continuously leaped between large houses and mansions. Wherever they passed, all the buildings collapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The citizens in the area fled in a panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“We should go too!” The Ning Clan cultivators also ran away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Chen and Ning Yong wanted to drag Ning Zhuo along, but Ning Zhuo suddenly said, “Why run? Let’s head back to the dungeon, it’s safer there!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The two were stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Grabbing their hands, Ning Zhuo said, “Just trust me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The trio returned to the dungeon. When they re-entered the prison cell, their seats and fruits had yet to be cleared away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After sitting down, Ning Zhuo explained, “Although there is a defensive grand formation in the immortal city that limits the combat power of all cultivators, those in the Golden Core stage are still invincible existences to the likes of us.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“What if they pass by us while fighting? It’ll be just like that time in the Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Sir Chi Dun is very strong. He’s a body cultivator, which is the type of cultivator that’s least suppressed by Fire Persimmon Immortal City’s grand formation. It’s very likely that he will win.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“The safest thing is for us to stay here and wait until he kills the black shadow demonic cultivator before leaving.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Chen and Ning Yong thought it through and realized that Ning Zhuo’s words made sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Boom, boom, boom…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The two Golden Core cultivators continued their battle. Each collision made the entire dungeon tremble, causing dust to continuously fall from the ceiling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Chen and Ning Yong fidgeted restlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">However, Ning Zhuo was calm and leisurely, eating fruit and drinking tea as if he was completely unaware of the battle outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Seeing their classmate’s relaxed behavior, Ning Chen and Ning Yong stared at him in admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo explained, “Well, I’ve given up. If the two Golden Core cultivators come over here, we’ll definitely die, so I might as well eat some more while I can. I don’t want to die hungry, after all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Chen was speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Yong slapped his forehead and gave Ning Zhuo a thumbs up. “Ah Zhuo, you’re right. Good thinking!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He stuffed a handful of grapes into his mouth, then called out to Ning Chen, “You too, hurry and eat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Chen rolled his eyes. Right now, his mood was very heavy, so he shook his head and said, “You guys can eat. I’m not hungry.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The battle between the two Golden Core cultivators didn’t last long. The trio in the dungeon found that the shaking was getting weaker and weaker and the sounds of the battle were moving farther and farther away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Eventually, the sounds of battle ceased, and a prison guard came over to fetch the three Ning Clan youths, bringing them back out of the dungeon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Chi Dun and the black shadow demonic cultivator were completely gone. Apparently, they had left the city during the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Large swathes of buildings had been reduced to rubble. Corpses could be seen everywhere among the ruins, and the cries of the survivors made the morning wind seem especially cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The three youths of the Ning Clan looked around with heavy hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“It’s strange. I used to think the immortal city was very safe!” Ning Yong said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Nign Chen sighed, “This is already a decent result. Thanks to the suppression of the grand formation, Golden Core cultivators can’t exert their full combat power. Without it, a single Golden Core-level spell could wipe out half the city.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo urged, “There’s nothing we can do about this. Let’s go back. All I want to do now is flop down on my bed and fall asleep.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">As soon as he spoke, Ning Yong and Ning Chen felt their own fatigue flare up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">After walking together for a while, Ning Zhuo bade the two farewell. Last night had truly been a harrowing process, and Ning Zhuo was utterly exhausted. He fell asleep the moment he touched his bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">By the time he woke up, it was already evening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After a simple meal, he entered his underground workshop again. He sat down cross-legged on a meditation mat and officially began his cultivation of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He had previously cultivated the Snowy Region Talisman Illustration Scripture, one of the Ning Clan’s three great techniques. Under normal circumstances, he would need to get rid of all of his illustration magical power before he could start cultivating another technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But this common sense didn’t apply to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Buddha Heart Demon Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">A demon to others, but a Buddha to the self.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Saving the self wasn’t just about suppressing thoughts and concealing intentions. It was also related to the conversion of magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">In an instant, the illustration magical power in Ning Zhuo’s body began transforming rapidly into five elements magical power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
