<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Divine Ability— Spiritual Resonance Pulse Detection</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">From the moment Ning Zhuo said he wanted to find Mu Lan, and left the camp in front of Liu Er, Liu Er had already used this natural talent of his.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">His innate talent worked as it always did and did not disappoint, allowing him to eavesdrop on the detailed conversation among Ning Zhuo, Mu Lan, and Zhang Chongyi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“A family-inherited ‘Profound Gold Armor-Breaking Art’? Didn’t the strategist say he wasn’t interested in this cultivation method?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“It’s because I didn’t agree to give him troop allotments, so he went off to the Red Flower Camp to seek help. It’s just a trade of benefits!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">When he heard that Ning Zhuo had only glanced at the ‘Profound Gold Armor-Breaking Art’ before gleaning numerous insights from it, and had immediately discussed with Zhang Chongyi on-site to design a treatment plan, Liu Er sank into a brief silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“As expected of someone born to a major clan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“No, even for someone from a major clan, the talent and comprehension of Strategist Ning Zhuo are extraordinary.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Although the loathing in Liu Er’s heart grew day by day, he had no choice but to admit Ning Zhuo’s excellence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Right after that, Zhang Chongyi’s misplaced needle caused Mu Lan to spit out a mouthful of fresh blood, and Liu Er’s expression instantly showed a hint of joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Good. There’s an error in the treatment, and Ning Zhuo also bears responsibility!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But in the next moment, he heard Zhang Chongyi shout, “Quick, quickly perform a ‘Blood Exchange’ on the General!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Blood Exchange?!” Liu Er’s ears perked up, and his expression changed drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Then he heard Zhang Chongyi sigh and leave the tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Liu Er’s expression changed again, and his heart clenched tight. “That old geezer, that old geezer!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He could tell that Zhang Chongyi was trying to matchmake Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Liu Er was so furious that he gnashed his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He could no longer sit still. He stood up, paced back and forth in the tent, appearing agitated, and simultaneously pushed his innate talent to the limit to listen closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“No, it can’t be.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Ning Zhuo is from a major clan, an upright and honorable man, very trustworthy. He said he wouldn’t do dual cultivation with Mu Lan, so he’ll definitely keep his word!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Liu Er tried to console himself, repeatedly telling himself to stay calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Then, in the next moment, he heard Ning Zhuo speak— “There’s one final area of stagnation. I’m going to break through with all my strength, so just bear with it for a bit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Liu Er felt as if he had been struck by lightning and froze on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Stagnation? Where is there stagnation in your body?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Break through with all your strength? Where do you plan to break through?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Bear with it?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">It no longer mattered whether Mu Lan could bear it; Liu Er himself could no longer bear it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“No, absolutely not!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“A single man and a single woman, all alone in one room —this is dangerous, too dangerous!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Ning Zhuo is a young man, with blood and energy at its peak. And Mu Lan, according to my investigation, although already in the Golden Core stage, has cultivated in hardship for years and has never been close to any man. Up to this day, she’s still a virgin!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Far too dangerous. I can’t let them stay together any longer.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Liu Er walked with hurried steps to the tent’s doorway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Just as he lifted the curtain, he heard Mu Lan let out a soft moan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">In that instant, Liu Er’s eyes widened, and his pupils shrank hard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“What the hell? What are you two trying to do?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“No, definitely not!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Liu Er could no longer remain calm. He leapt up, soared into the sky, and rushed straight toward the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">When Ning Zhuo heard Mu Lan’s voice, he abruptly raised his head. “What’s wrong?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Instantly, the intimate mood was completely destroyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Mu Lan felt annoyed. She had the urge to reach out and beat Ning Zhuo on his big head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">But met with Ning Zhuo’s clear and innocent gaze, for a moment, she couldn’t bring herself to do it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">In the end, she snorted coldly, suppressing her shame, and forcibly changed the subject. “Your treatment methods still need improvement.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">She assumed that Ning Zhuo would argue back and say something like “I’m not a physician,” and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">However, Ning Zhuo immediately accepted her criticism. He nodded repeatedly, looking earnest. “Yes, yes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“The medical arts are vast and profound. I’m only dabbling partway, and my own healing ability is weak.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Compared to Lord Zhang Chongyi, there’s really no comparison. Even any other ordinary healer would have far more experience than I do and more skillful healing techniques. If they treated you, General Mu Lan, you surely wouldn’t have felt pain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Mu Lan: ……</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">She fell silent for a moment before continuing, “Young Master Ning Zhuo, you and I doing dual cultivation is a win-win for both of us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“From your large-scale purchase of puppet constructs and formation of an army, it’s clear that not only do you intend to participate in the war, you also want to show off your prowess in the upcoming battles and gain military achievements.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“War is perilous. You’ve experienced an ambush before; you should understand the weight of this word.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“In such a situation, if you and I do dual cultivation, your cultivation will surely increase, helping you survive on the battlefield. Why wouldn’t you want that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Up in midair, Liu Er heard these words and grew even more anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">A fierce wind struck his face, and he shouted inwardly, “No, don’t do dual cultivation, don’t do it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Mu Lan fixed her gaze on the white-robed youth nearby, continuing her persuasion. “I know your concerns— it’s merely about your Yang Energy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“But is Pure Yang really that important?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“The cultivation method you practice doesn’t actually care whether you have your Pure Yang or not.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“And regarding a future alliance with the Southern Bean royal family… to be honest, Pure Yang isn’t that important, either. It’s just a show of respect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“If you become strong, with a bright future ahead, and considering your Ning Family’s massive wealth, would the Southern Bean royal family cause a conflict over something as minor as ‘Pure Yang’?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“If you do dual cultivation with me now, we’ll both gain considerable strength. By the time you earn even more merits on the battlefield, you’ll have grown even stronger. Once you reach a certain level of power, the Southern Bean royal family will beg to form an alliance with you, won’t they?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“You’re from a major clan and well-read. Do you really not understand these principles?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo lowered his head, remaining silent, as his magic power flowed through his palm, pressing against Mu Lan’s lower abdomen and continually pouring into her body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Mu Lan couldn’t see Ning Zhuo’s expression, so she kept pressing the issue. Feigning a casual tone, she said, “Oh, right.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“My father once seized a piece of loot on the battlefield, a mechanical battle armor from Tang Jifeng known as the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“I’ve already written home so that the servants at the mansion will send this piece of mechanical armor here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo lifted his head, his eyes lighting up. “Oh?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He was quite delighted. “Tang Jifeng? Is he that ‘Hundred-Armed General’ who crushed bandits in Cangqing Mountain, saw through Tian Guan’s mechanical traps, destroyed the enemy army entirely in the Chiyan Desert War, and set up an ambush in the Cloud Sea to kill a Nascent Soul–level enemy general?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo listed them as though counting his own treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He had read many books and knew quite a bit about renowned mechanical cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Tang Jifeng was one of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He excelled at using his own strength to control numerous puppets all at once, forming an army to fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Currently, Ning Zhuo’s act of building an army of puppet constructs was essentially doing the same thing Tang Jifeng had done!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Since mechanical cultivation had developed over so many years, there were already cultivators who used beast hordes to form an army, and also those who used mechanical constructs to form an army. This wasn’t anything new.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">So Mu Lan was not at all surprised to see Ning Zhuo using puppet constructs to form an army, nor did she doubt their combat prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">However, at that moment, seeing the spark in Ning Zhuo’s eyes, Mu Lan was faintly annoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“In Ning Zhuo’s mind, these mechanical creations are more appealing than I am!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Mu Lan suppressed her complicated emotions and continued enticing him: “In fact, it’s not just this mechanical battle armor at the mansion, there’s also Tang Jifeng’s personal notes on controlling mechanical constructs and commanding them in battle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“Back in the day, I read through those notes in order to prepare for potential enemies and gained quite a bit of knowledge about mechanical cultivators.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Oh?” Ning Zhuo’s eyes glinted again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Inwardly, Mu Lan snorted coldly. “Young Master Ning Zhuo, you should spend the night here tonight. I can pass on the knowledge from those notes to you —I remember it all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Well…” Ning Zhuo hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Meanwhile, high in the air, Liu Er was already seething with impatience. “Spend the night? Spend the night doing what?! That can’t happen!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“What do you mean ‘pass on mechanical notes’?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“Mu Lan, so you’re actually like this, fooling and enticing my strategist!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Liu Er was both exasperated and helpless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He suddenly realized that it was Ning Zhuo whom he trusted more. Mu Lan was behaving more and more proactively, and he feared that Ning Zhuo might fail to hold his ground, that things might go too far and actual dual cultivation might occur!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Mu Lan fixed her eyes on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">She was the valiant daughter of a Grand Marshal, and everything she did followed that style—swift and decisive!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">In her opinion, although Ning Zhuo’s treatment plan was effective, it was still treating the symptoms rather than the root cause. To truly get at the root, the path of dual cultivation was the only solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Ning Zhuo is out traveling, and after this war, he’ll continue roaming, leaving Two Note Kingdom.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“By then, our relationship will be dissolved, and Grand Marshal Mu’s Mansion will become a prey in the eyes of others once again. They’ll come for us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“But if Ning Zhuo remains in this position, my Mu Family’s Grand Marshal’s mansion will still be safe.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Mu Lan had very little genuine affection for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">She mostly approached this from the perspective of the Mu Family general’s mansion, weighing the pros and cons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Tang Jifeng…” Ning Zhuo furrowed his brow slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Under Mu Lan’s expectant gaze, he was just about to speak when sudden footfalls echoed from outside the tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">They were very hurried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“General Liu, General Liu! Please wait, please wait. Allow me to first report to my lord,” Mu Lan’s female deputy called out anxiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Liu Er was in a state of desperate urgency, his ears perked as he constantly used his innate talent to eavesdrop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Wait?! If I wait any longer, those two inside the tent will start doing dual cultivation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">With a flick of his sleeve, Liu Er shook off the female deputy, using the excuse, “I’m not here to see your General.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">In the next second, he headed straight for the tent, calling out urgently, “Strategist, Strategist! Come out, quick. There’s an urgent matter, an urgent matter!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Zhang Chongyi also heard the commotion and came over, glaring at Liu Er for ruining his plans. In his eyes, nothing was as important as getting Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“That many-eared scoundrel is despicable. Always spoiling other people’s business!” Zhang Chongyi cursed inwardly as he walked over to tug Liu Er away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Yet Ning Zhuo had already lifted the tent flap and come outside. “General, is something urgent happening?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Liu Er glanced into the tent but didn’t see Mu Lan. Now that the tent flap blocked his view, all he could do was look at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Clearly, Mu Lan didn’t want to see him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Strategist, Strategist, it’s enough that you’ve come out.” Liu Er grabbed Ning Zhuo’s arm and dragged him out of the army camp. “I have urgent business to discuss with you. Let’s leave the camp first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">After exiting Red Flower Camp, Liu Er didn’t take Ning Zhuo back to the Three Generals Camp; instead, he led him to a hidden corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Using his magic, Liu Er created a space suitable for secret conversation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“Strategist, my master entrusted someone to deliver a treasure to me. I just received it, and immediately discovered that it could be immensely useful to both you and General Mu Lan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“Take a look.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The next moment, Ning Zhuo saw the YinYang One Qi Kettle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“What’s this?” Ning Zhuo asked in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Liu Er placed the treasure directly into Ning Zhuo’s hands, letting him examine it thoroughly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo turned it over and over, using his spiritual sense to check it. He exclaimed repeatedly, “What a fine treasure, truly a fine treasure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Liu Er forced himself to suppress the pain in his heart, forced a smile, and explained to Ning Zhuo the artifact’s powers and functions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up. He immediately thought, “This seems to be exactly what General Mu Lan’s injury needs.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">“Is that so? Then that’s even better!” Liu Er slapped his thigh, his face filled with apparent joy, but he was actually hurting inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo caressed the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle and expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Liu Er affectionately patted Ning Zhuo on the shoulder, beaming with warmth. “Once I obtained this treasure, I immediately thought of how, among the Three Generals Camp, you’re the youngest, Strategist, and you have the most need to improve your cultivation. That’s why I’ve brought it to you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo’s eyes grew slightly moist. “General Liu treats me so generously. I, Zhuo, shall remember this with all my heart!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Inwardly, Liu Er thought, “If you’re truly grateful, don’t do dual cultivation with Mu Lan!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He very much wanted to say it out loud but ultimately didn’t.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">If he said it, his intention would be too obvious!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">“With this treasure, maybe I can do dual cultivation with myself!” Ning Zhuo said excitedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">He had considered this idea for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">At the moment, he wanted nothing more than to test it out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">As for dual cultivation with Mu Lan?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Dual cultivation my ass!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">It wasn’t nearly as convenient as dual cultivation with himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Elsewhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">A certain elderly demon cultivator was left dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Just now, he had sensed a sudden surge in Ning Zhuo’s destiny.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">At present, in Ning Zhuo’s destiny —represented by an arm —another treasure jug appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ning Zhuo’s fate-arm held the treasure jug, and the jug gradually shrank in his hand until it vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">“The Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">“How did that treasure Kettle end up in Ning Zhuo’s hands?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“What is Little Six doing?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">“You damned disciple!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The old demon cultivator was utterly infuriated. He had worked hard to accumulate many treasures, yet now Ning Zhuo’s destiny had soared yet again, leaving him no choice but to keep pouring in more resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Gritting his teeth, the old demon cultivator tore off the fox fur on his back and threw it into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">He continued taking out treasured materials from his storage pouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">“These are all my valuable collections from over the years.” The old demon cultivator’s heart throbbed with immense pain, crying out with grief!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">But he had to keep adding more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Of course, he didn’t forget to send out a message, demanding answers from Liu Er’s side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Before long, he received a reply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Once the old demon cultivator learned the situation, he fell into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">He forgave Liu Er and felt the latter had done the right thing. After all, if Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan did dual cultivation —merging Pure Yang and Pure Yin —their intertwined destinies would both skyrocket.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">And based on the old demon cultivator’s calculations, such a surge would surpass even the increase brought by obtaining the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">“Ning Zhuo is too big a threat!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">“He must be removed!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">“This time, I’ve used the last reserves in my vault. I refuse to believe Ning Zhuo’s fortune can still rise again!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">“I’ve paid such a huge price. The one who seizes his fate and returns it to life can only be Liu Er!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Almost at the same moment, near Fire Persimmon Mountain—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">A message had just been delivered to Ning Jiufan’s hands.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
