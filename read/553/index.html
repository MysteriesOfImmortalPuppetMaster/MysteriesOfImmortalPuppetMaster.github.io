<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div><br/>
The offensive and defensive battle around the frontline camp of Two Note Nation had reached a state of white-hot intensity by this time.<br/>
<br/>
The Thousand Peaks Forest Allied Forces and the Two Note Nation’s grand army, like two giants clashing, had reached the perilous moment of hand-to-hand combat and bayonet bloodshed.<br/>
<br/>
This was a chaotic battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
In some areas, the armies interlocked like teeth, while in others one side clearly held the advantage.<br/>
<br/>
The defensive line that the Two Note Nation’s grand army had built around the city wall had already collapsed by about half.<br/>
<br/>
Although most of the city wall still remained, on the other side, under the charge of Lord Long and Lu Hongtu, the defensive line had collapsed. A large number of cultivators and soldiers from the Thousand Peaks Forest Allied Forces had surged into this military camp - painstakingly constructed at great expense - through the gaps in the defensive line.<br/>
<br/>
Shouts of killing filled the sky and earth, and repeated explosions shook the heavens.<br/>
<br/>
Countless spells intertwined, forming dazzling, resplendent bursts of colorful light, brilliant yet lethal.<br/>
<br/>
A massive number of weapons and magical artifacts collided with each other, and in the most intense contest, superiority was determined in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
And often, that difference in superiority was the difference between life and death!<br/>
<br/>
Whether it was the Two Note Nation or the Thousand Peaks Forest Allied Forces, the number of casualties was rapidly increasing.<br/>
<br/>
Both sides had entered a stalemate stage, engaging in extremely brutal attrition, with countless warriors falling every moment and losing their lives.<br/>
<br/>
If a grandmaster of military strategy - a leader of great genius - were to witness this scene of battle, he would surely scoff.<br/>
<br/>
Both sides fought fiercely, but without any proper military strategy.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long, the temple priest of the Dragon King Temple, himself was weak in combat, but was proficient in the art of warfare.<br/>
<br/>
The commander of the Two Note Nation, Du Tiechuan, was indeed formidable, but he was busy treating his wounds and had not appeared at all.<br/>
<br/>
It was precisely because of his shortcomings that, in the full-scale confrontation between Two Note Nation and the Thousand Peaks Forest Allied Forces, the advantages of military strategy did not manifest - resulting in an even match.<br/>
<br/>
In a certain mountain hollow far from the battlefield, the space suddenly rippled.<br/>
<br/>
Out of thin air, a man in white appeared, wearing a wide-sleeved long robe, his hair as black as clouds. His features were refined and handsome, his eyes white and distinct and at that moment he was filled with a fighting spirit.<br/>
<br/>
It was Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Emerging from the mechanical dragon, he waved his hand, causing the enormous, serpent-like mechanical dragon to shrink rapidly, coiling itself around Ning Zhuo’s waist. The dragon's head and tail joined together, forming a sturdy belt.<br/>
<br/>
“Joining Two Note’s battle has finally provided the opportunity I've been seeking - to seize the mechanical carriage,” Ning Zhuo murmured quietly, excitement simmering beneath his composed exterior.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had risked probing the Six Caves Sect's base, barely escaping with their lives after being discovered. Afterward, Ning Zhuo had refrained from further risky infiltrations, understanding that the Allied Forces would bolster defenses specifically against such intrusions.<br/>
<br/>
Repeating the same strategy would have been foolish.<br/>
<br/>
“Now is the perfect moment.”<br/>
<br/>
“There's no need to infiltrate the Six Caves Sect's headquarters directly. The sect had practically emptied its nest; even the Demon Heart Cave Master was engaged in fierce battle, his attention fully occupied.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo joined the battle not to seek the opportunity to strike at the frontline to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo joined the army not to fight blindly on the frontline but to patiently seek out the ideal moment to act.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, his patience had paid off.<br/>
<br/>
There was no alternative. With relatively limited cultivation, Ning Zhuo knew his only chance against the Six Caves Sect was by taking advantage of chaos to seize the mechanical carriage.<br/>
<br/>
“The threat of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth will only grow stronger over time.”<br/>
<br/>
“Perhaps this is not just my first, but also my last chance to strike.”<br/>
<br/>
“Once my intentions regarding the mechanical carriage are exposed, future opportunities will be severely limited.”<br/>
<br/>
“The cunning Alliance will undoubtedly use the mechanical carriage to lay traps for me!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s resolve sharpened further at this thought, his fighting spirit igniting into an unstoppable blaze.<br/>
<br/>
From his storage pouch, Ning Zhuo took out mechanical puppets one after another.<br/>
<br/>
Quickly, more than seven hundred mechanical puppets neatly assembled beside him, forming a formidable mechanical army.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also took out a treasure-level mechanical armor.<br/>
<br/>
That mechanical armor of Little Zhuo was of an ancient bronze hue, imposing and heavy, giving one a sense of resolute strength; yet its lines were smooth and its curves graceful, imparting a sense of compassion and strictness.<br/>
<br/>
Its helmet’s forehead was slightly raised, with a circular halo resembling Ning Zhuo’s Dharma appearance. On both sides, visor horns were designed, resembling ox horns.<br/>
<br/>
The front of the chest armor was carved with an image of Ning Zhuo, embodying the protective array guarded by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
It was none other than the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor!<br/>
<br/>
This was a gift given by Mu Lan to Little Zhuo; when he received it, it was only a half-body heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
But now, the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor was already a full-body armor; its previously incomplete lower half had been supplemented by Little Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
“Although it relied on three mechanical pedestals to temporarily complete the lower half, it was obvious that the lower half was only cobbled together in haste.”<br/>
<br/>
“Not only was it completely inconsistent with the upper half-merely for show-but even its protective capability did not reach 30% of that of the upper half.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s main work was to disguise it.<br/>
<br/>
He endeavored to make the lower battle armor as similar to the upper half as possible, at least so that in terms of design and aura, there was no difference.<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, look at me.” Ning Zhuo’s expression was somewhat excited.<br/>
<br/>
“Ah?” Sun Lingtong, who was in the Dragon’s Head Cabin, wore a puzzled expression.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo raised his arms high and shouted at the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor, “Hundred-Armed Arhat, let the battle armor cover me!”<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor actively flew to Little Zhuo’s front and split into upper and lower parts.<br/>
<br/>
The upper part flew above Little Zhuo’s head, slowly descended, enveloping him within the battle armor, while the lower part split with a clattering sound, forming two halves of the mechanical battle armor - one in the front and one in the back.<br/>
<br/>
The two parts of the separated mechanical battle armor - one suspended in front of Ning Zhuo and the other flying behind, after wrapping around his lower half - combined with each other, interlocking tightly, with everything fitting perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
“Wow, wow, wow!” Sun Lingtong gaped, his eyes sparkling like stars, so excited that he kept exclaiming.<br/>
<br/>
“So cool, so cool!!” Sun Lingtong shouted, and for a moment, his full attention was captured, with no more pre-battle tension.<br/>
<br/>
He jumped excitedly within the dragon-head cabin. "You rascal, doing something so cool without telling me! I want one - I definitely need one too!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong almost wished he could immediately replace Ning Zhuo - for he did not have a set of mechanical armor - and if he could stand behind Little Zhuo and call out softly, Little Zhuo would automatically have his armor cover him.<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha!" Ning Zhuo laughed aloud, imitating Sun Lingtong’s enthusiastic pose with his hands on his hips. "Boss, see the wonders of mastering mechanical arts?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong playfully scolded, "Rascal, you'd better craft one for me before the next battle, or you’ll regret it!"<br/>
<br/>
He then sincerely added, "Mechanical arts should definitely not be called the least of the hundred cultivation arts. With what you've just shown me, it clearly deserves to be the greatest!"<br/>
<br/>
"Don't worry, Boss. I'll personally design a special mechanical armor for you that you'll definitely love," Ning Zhuo reassured confidently, patting his chest.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong snorted lightly, "If it doesn’t meet my expectations, I’ll never forgive you! But Zhuo, give it your all out there."<br/>
<br/>
“Make this battle a display of your prowess.”<br/>
<br/>
“With your talent and dedication, in the future when you promote the mechanical arts and show the world what they can do, it might even be possible for the art of mechanisms to become the foremost of the hundred arts.”<br/>
<br/>
“You will definitely achieve this, and your name will be recorded in history. In the future, whenever a junior disciple think of the art of mechanisms, they will inevitably remember you and unconsciously raise their pinkies in admiration!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo waved his hands humbly, "Boss, you're praising me too much. I still have a long way to go and much more to learn."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong blinked, but said nothing further.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo donned the mechanical Arhmat Armor and, placing himself among the mechanical army, immediately set off, rushing toward the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The appearance of this new arrival went unnoticed amid the ongoing action.<br/>
<br/>
On the chaotic battlefield, among the cultivators and armies, they interlocked like teeth, each fighting their own battles. <br/>
<br/>
Battle Formation - Swift Wind Formation!<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical puppets formed a battle formation; their speed suddenly increasing, becoming extremely nimble.<br/>
<br/>
Up to this day, Ning Zhuo had experienced several small battles and had become proficient in activating that formation; however, during the march, mechanical puppets began to fall.<br/>
<br/>
“What is happening?” Ning Zhuo exclaimed in astonishment. In response, he heard the rustling of Gu insects.<br/>
<br/>
These were Gu worms released by Li Jiuqu, scattered widely across the battlefield. <br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo’s forces rushed forward, they encountered these insects first.<br/>
<br/>
A wave of poisonous mist drifted over, and signs of corrosion appeared on the mechanical puppets. Some that were affected by the corrosion directly fell to the ground, losing contact with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
A blood-red river burst apart, and part of it surged through Ning Zhuo's puppet ranks like a crimson stream, destroying more than seventy units.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, war drums resonated, shattering a dozen mechanical puppets at the rear.<br/>
<br/>
Even before officially entering the heart of battle, Ning Zhuo’s mechanical army was repeatedly reduced in numbers due to these chaotic attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo, previously joking and playful, were now serious and grim-faced. Since joining this war, they had never witnessed such intense pressure firsthand.<br/>
<br/>
Watching from afar was one thing; actively participating was another entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Neither Sun Lingtong nor Ning Zhuo had experienced something like this before, even during Ning Zhuo's desperate defense of the Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
This was the seventh major engagement!<br/>
<br/>
A war led by Soul Formation experts, with Nascent Soul cultivators as commanders, and even Golden Core cultivators relegated to mid-tier combat roles!<br/>
<br/>
The conflict had entered the most brutal attrition phase, where victory depended entirely on who could endure longer.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, the eventual victor would suffer immense losses - a pyrrhic victory at best.<br/>
<br/>
“This is only an internal conflict within one nation,” Sun Lingtong remarked soberly. “ Two Note’s army is newly formed, while the Thousand Peaks Alliance lackes formal military training.”<br/>
<br/>
Through spiritual communication, Ning Zhuo continued to advance with his mechanical forces, finally engaging their first group of enemies.<br/>
<br/>
It was a clustered group of barbarian cultivators, supporting each other tightly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s assault immediately put these barbarian cultivators in a disadvantageous position, surrounded and pressured from multiple sides.<br/>
<br/>
With a wave of his hand, Ning Zhuo unleashed waves of fire, earth, and metal-elemental spells, bombarding the enemy fiercely, though causing minimal casualties initially.<br/>
<br/>
"Break through, quickly!"<br/>
<br/>
"The situation is dire!"<br/>
<br/>
"We can't stay encircled; cut a path out!"<br/>
<br/>
The barbarian cultivators sensed imminent defeat and erupted with powerful counterattacks. Ning Zhuo's mechanical army struggled to contain them, suffering significant puppet losses during the barbarians’ desperate breakout.<br/>
<br/>
Glancing briefly at their escape, Ning Zhuo chose not to pursue, instead pushing deeper into the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever mechanical puppets were lost, Ning Zhuo immediately replenished.<br/>
<br/>
Rich in resources and backed by his mechanical pedestals solving his production issue, Ning Zhuo had an abundant reserve of mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
Military Art - Heroic Return Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo still hadn't fully grasped the profundities of this art, derived from the exquisite integration of "Shared Battle Armor Technique" and "Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings", vastly superior to ordinary military arts.<br/>
<br/>
Though he hadn't mastered it fully, Ning Zhuo still benefited from it. The more mechanical puppets he lost, the stronger his combat prowess became.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Ning Zhuo reached the middle of the battlefield, his combat strength had escalated to the Golden Core level, and cultivators slain by his forces numbered over two hundred.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong also assisted in controlling the mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
By now, after many battles, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo had significantly improved their puppet control, becoming more decisive and skilled in combat.<br/>
<br/>
As they pressed forward into the heart of the battlefield, Ning Zhuo felt a marked increase in resistance, significantly slowing their advance.<br/>
<br/>
The inner area of the battlefield was relatively open, with substantial gaps between large and small fighting groups, allowing Ning Zhuo's mechanical army to weave through them easily.<br/>
<br/>
However, as they reached the battlefield's midpoint, the fighting groups became significantly denser, drastically narrowing the space for maneuver. Ning Zhuo's mechanical army now had to face attacks from all directions, struggling not only to clear enemies in front but also to withstand continuous assaults from the sides and rear.<br/>
<br/>
“In the core area of the battlefield, our army will hardly be able to move!” Ning Zhuo thought with concern.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, his goal wasn't to penetrate deep into the heart of Two Note' main camp. Lin You himself was located mid-battlefield, and Ning Zhuo guided his mechanical troops straight toward him.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the barbarian cultivator Gu Ya was commanding his army of wolves, launching assaults on the city walls. With a sweep of spiritual awareness, Gu Ya noticed Ning Zhuo's mechanical forces approaching.<br/>
<br/>
Aowu!<br/>
<br/>
A thought flashed through Gu Ya's mind. Not willing to let Ning Zhuo’s forces gain momentum, he decisively split off a large contingent from his wolf army, directing them straight at Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The wolves attacked swiftly from the flank, their movements as rapid as the wind.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong urgently warned Ning Zhuo, whose heart instantly tightened. "This is Gu Ya's true strength!"<br/>
<br/>
Under immense pressure, Gu Ya was fighting at full strength, demonstrating a formidable power previously unseen.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s mechanical troops quickly adopted a defensive stance, clustering together.<br/>
<br/>
The wolves surged forward like a tidal wave, crashing into Ning Zhuo's mechanical formation. The neatly arrayed puppets appeared strong but were merely superficial - collapsing rapidly under the wolves' charge.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo anticipated this outcome, he couldn't help sighing: "Time was too short; I haven't even learned a proper Iron Barrel formation yet."<br/>
<br/>
As mechanical puppets fell, Ning Zhuo continually replaced them. But under the relentless assault of the wolves pressing from every direction, there was no room to reorganize.<br/>
<br/>
Viewed from above, Ning Zhuo's occupied area steadily shrank, teetering on the brink of total collapse...<br/>
<br/>
Roar!<br/>
<br/>
Eight fire dragons suddenly soared into the sky, spiraling around, incinerating flesh and bone alike. Raging flames swiftly transformed the entire battlefield segment.<br/>
<br/>
Clad in his mechanical armor, Ning Zhuo stood firm amidst the sea of flames, exceptionally striking and imposing. Beside him, three fire dragons roared and surged through the fiery domain.<br/>
<br/>
Spell - Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique!<br/>
<br/>
The number of fire dragons corresponded to the cultivator’s level. Normally, Ning Zhuo, at Foundation Establishment, could only conjure two dragons. But leveraging mechanical arts and military formations, he reached Golden Core-level power, successfully summoning three dragons!<br/>
<br/>
Under the relentless blaze, the wolf army was utterly annihilated. Ning Zhuo pressed forward relentlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Empowered by the Heroic Return Technique, his strength continued to climb rapidly!<br/>
