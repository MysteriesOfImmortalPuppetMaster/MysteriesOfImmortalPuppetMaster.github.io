<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 717: Ning Zhuo, I'll Make You My Dog!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Come in! Why aren't you coming in?" Lady Spiderweb, hiding within her Cave Abode, grew increasingly impatient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo watched the crowd squeeze into the cave, yet he remained unhurried. His fingers unconsciously rubbed the Mechanism Ring, but it remained still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo's mind drifted back to the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The high-level intelligence he had acquired at great cost naturally included information about Che Zhuzi. Though Ning Zhuo had vague memories of this, he couldn't recall the details clearly. Such minor details were impossible to remember perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Perhaps I should study this intelligence more thoroughly when I return?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Like a child with a long stick, poking and sweeping at everything in sight, Ning Zhuo's learning ability had surged. He now felt compelled to try and learn everything he encountered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He retrieved the Intelligence Jade Slip, held it in his hand, and probed it with his divine sense. After a quick scan, he confirmed the relevant information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Ah, Che Zhuzi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"The 'Omnipotent' Che Zhuzi..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This referred to Che Zhuzi's nickname.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In his early years, shortly after transforming into human form, Che Zhuzi, being a demon insect by nature, lacked intelligence and was often deceived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Che Zhuzi's secreted Void Spider Silk was an exceptionally practical and precious treasure. As a result, any cultivator could exchange worthless junk for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">At the time, Che Zhuzi had no worldly experience. If something caught his eye or he believed their extravagant claims, he would readily trade his precious Void Spider Silk for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This worked, that worked... Hence, he earned the nickname "Anything Goes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Of course, Che Zhuzi had since matured into a Golden Core Demon Cultivator. His horizons had broadened considerably, and his intelligence had grown alongside his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo mused, "Void Spider Silk is indeed remarkably practical."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"If I were to use only spiritual energy to suspend threads, the range would be far inferior to using Void Spider Silk."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"While Life Hanging by a Thread is powerful, as a Divine Art, it has limitations - it can only communicate with sentient beings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Although Ning Zhuo could temporarily imbue inanimate objects with spiritual energy, this effect was fleeting. Each use consumed vast amounts of spiritual energy, making it a last-resort trump card rather than a regular technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"If I use Life Hanging by a Thread, I won't be able to control the newly crafted Vowel Bamboo Puppet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"But with Void Spider Silk, I can. This precious material is incredibly useful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">With this realization, Ning Zhuo made up his mind and slowly walked through the entrance of the Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"He's finally entered!" Lady Spiderweb trembled with excitement as she watched him approach, her cheeks flushing slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">This was clearly a Formation Space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Square gray stone bricks paved a vast plaza.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The "sky" above resembled an inverted lead cauldron, its gray clouds hanging low like dirty cotton wads, threatening to collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The ground stretched out infinitely in all directions. At the horizon, the gray bricks blurred into the leaden clouds, making it impossible to distinguish where the land ended and the sky began, as if heaven and earth were one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Che Zhuzi remained unseen, but his voice echoed through the space, announcing the rules.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Fellow Daoists, welcome to the Rising Cloud Trial I have established."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"This trial consists of only three stages. This is the first stage - Starlight in the Wind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Fellow Daoists need only manipulate their marionette strings or hanging threads to illuminate the starlight points to achieve victory and advance to the next stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Begin now," Che Zhuzi announced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">As soon as his words faded, faint starlight began to appear in the distant sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">These starlight fragments, resembling fireflies, were sparse and constantly shifting, leaving trails of deep blue streaks across the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo focused his gaze, only to discover that his observation spells were suppressed by the Grand Formation. He was forced to rely on his naked eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"The starlight's speed varies erratically, and its movements follow no discernible pattern," Ning Zhuo murmured, narrowing his eyes as he studied the phenomenon. "This will be challenging."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Even as he observed, cultivators began to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Threads of condensed spiritual energy shot forth like lightning bolts, slicing through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Suddenly, a powerful gust of wind materialized from nowhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">This wind was clearly unnatural, instantly dispersing the spiritual energy threads and causing them to collapse mid-flight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo understood immediately: "The first trial is called 'Starlight in the Wind.' This must be what it refers to."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">A pale-faced cultivator snorted coldly, flicking his sleeve to unleash a slender green vine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The vine, being a physical entity infused with spiritual energy and controlled by divine sense, proved far more resistant to the wind's assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">All eyes turned to watch the vine's progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The wind grew stronger, but the slender vine remained resilient, extending through the air with unwavering force, swaying only slightly in the gale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Yet the Pale-Faced Cultivator's expression darkened further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Suddenly, the vine ceased its advance, halting abruptly mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The cultivators immediately turned their questioning gazes toward the Pale-Faced Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">His face twitched, but he forced out a resentful explanation: "I didn't expect the distance to be so vast!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">His vine was a physical entity with a limited length.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Through this cultivator's failed attempt, Ning Zhuo identified the third challenge of the first trial: "This formation space restricts spell-based observation. Relying solely on the naked eye makes misjudgment very likely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"These starlight points are indeed far apart. To use physical puppet strings, we need to ensure they're long enough!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Recalling the information from the Intelligence Jade Slip, Ning Zhuo had a sudden realization: "No, perhaps the distance isn't fixed. This Grand Formation is controlled by Che Zhuzi. He's likely manipulating it from behind the scenes to create the most advantageous scenario for himself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The cultivators began their own attempts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Many possessed physical puppet strings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">However, most found themselves in the same predicament as the Pale-Faced Cultivator: their strings were too short to reach the distant starlight points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo knew this situation was perfectly normal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">When manipulating mechanical constructs with threads, the optimal range was usually mid-range. Beyond that, delays in the transmission of spiritual energy and divine sense through the threads would occur.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Moreover, the longer the threads, the greater the interference between them, creating massive vulnerabilities that enemies could easily exploit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Therefore, cultivators rarely used excessively long threads when controlling mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Che Zhuzi's deliberate arrangement had placed the cultivators and their targets at an unexpectedly great distance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">But this challenge didn't deter Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After observing the formation for a while and testing it with threads of spiritual energy several times, he discerned the underlying pattern of the strong winds within the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">On the spot, he devised a spell specifically tailored to counter the winds, creating specialized threads of spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Lifebound Spell: Five Elements Creation and Destruction Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Five Viscera Temple Spirit Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Empowered by these two spells, the Five Elements Spiritual Power spiraled together, continuously generating and reinforcing each other, overcoming the strong winds and extending faster than physical threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After numerous failed attempts, Ning Zhuo suddenly succeeded, illuminating a starlight point and advancing to the next round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Some observant cultivators noticed this and turned to observe Ning Zhuo with renewed interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo was the only cultivator in the arena to have passed the trial solely by condensing spiritual energy into threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">In the shadows, Che Zhuzi was momentarily stunned. By the time he tried to alter the Formation and change the nature of the gale, it was too late. He couldn't help but quietly observe Ning Zhuo, realizing the latter had used a feigned weakness strategy. Some of his earlier failures might have been deliberate, allowing him to suddenly succeed and evade the change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo scanned the surroundings and noticed that at least forty percent of the cultivators, after numerous failed attempts, were on the verge of elimination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">These cultivators were growing frantic and desperate. Some pleaded with those who had passed for help, asking to borrow their physical silk threads, but all were refused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After all, they were competitors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The cultivators who had passed were eager to see as many eliminated in the first trial as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But at that moment, Che Zhuzi's voice echoed through the arena, and a bundle of Void Spider Silk materialized before the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"For just ten mid-grade spirit stones, you can rent a strand of Void Spider Silk for use."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Fellow Daoists, please remember the rules: this Void Spider Silk can only be used in the first trial and is only a temporary rental."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This news brought overwhelming joy to the cultivators who had been unable to pass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Some cultivators scoffed coldly, while others stared in stunned disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"As expected, they've arrived," Ning Zhuo thought, unsurprised after reviewing the intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Che Zhuzi's primary goal in organizing the Rising Cloud Trial is to promote his Void Spider Silk."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Therefore, the cultivators renting the Void Spider Silk will experience its capabilities firsthand. Their performance will leave a lasting impression on others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Hmm... I'll rent one too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Even though he had already passed the trial, Ning Zhuo rented a strand of Void Spider Silk and attempted it again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This time, he completed the trial in less than a third of the time, finishing almost effortlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The cultivators on the verge of elimination erupted in joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"This Void Spider Silk can pierce the Void, making it far longer than its physical length!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"It's incredible! Absolutely incredible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"I'm buying several strands! Where can I get them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Rent? No way! I'm not short on Spirit Stones!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">From the cultivators' shouts, Ning Zhuo knew Che Zhuzi's marketing strategy had succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo secretly praised Che Zhuzi's arrangement: "Ten mid-grade Spirit Stones for rental - most cultivators can afford that. The pricing is carefully calculated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"It seems cheap, but it's actually quite clever."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Renting it is only useful for the first trial. I'm sure similar situations will arise in the subsequent trials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">As Ning Zhuo pondered this, he remained unaware that Lady Spiderweb had been observing him the entire time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Seeing Ning Zhuo rent the Void Spider Silk, Lady Spiderweb threw her head back and laughed triumphantly. "He fell right into my trap! It's so easy to trick young fools like him. All it takes is a little scheming."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Ah, Ban Ji and his lot are truly brainless. They don't understand the art of maneuvering or the importance of laying groundwork!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Every cultivator who had failed to pass the first trial rented the Void Spider Silk. After all, ten mid-grade spirit stones was a small price to pay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Thus, everyone qualified to enter the second trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Che Zhuzi's voice echoed through the Formation Space, brimming with encouragement. "Congratulations, Fellow Daoists, on successfully advancing to the next trial!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"A good start is half the battle!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"My Rising Cloud Trial consists of only three trials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Next is the second trial - Poison Flower Heart Extraction!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Formation Space shuddered. The distant starlight vanished completely, and carriage-sized poisonous flowers materialized mid-air, settling onto the tiled floor at wide intervals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">These vividly colored poisonous flowers rapidly released a thick, greasy toxic gas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Soon, the gas accumulated into dense layers of poisonous miasma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">According to Che Zhuzi's instructions, cultivators needed to use suspension threads to extract the flower stamens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Finally, the top half of the cultivators, ranked by their performance, would advance to the third stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Fellow Daoists, a reminder: Void Spider Silk is available here, but quantities are limited. Purchase quickly!" Che Zhuzi shamelessly promoted his product without even pretending to be impartial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Cultivators immediately inquired about the price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The price was more than a hundred times higher than expected, causing some cultivators' faces to darken as they exclaimed, "Highway robbery!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Myriad Manifestations Sect recruited widely, so many ordinary or even lower-class individuals participated in the Flying Cloud Assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Unwilling to waste money, many cultivators immediately activated their suspension threads and launched them at the poisonous flowers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The poisonous miasma proved devastating, rapidly corroding and dissolving the threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The cultivators' expressions turned grim, yet they refused to give up. They began employing various techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Spell: Mystic Ice Encasement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Spell: Flame Attachment Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Spell: Thousand Golden Patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Various spells reinforced the threads, causing their strength to surge and clash violently with the Poisonous Miasma, creating a hissing, crackling din across the arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Some cultivators succeeded, while others failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo watched with keen interest. "I never imagined there were so many spells capable of enhancing threads. This far exceeds what's recorded in the texts Mother left behind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo's horizons had truly been broadened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Che Zhuzi lurked in the shadows, his gaze fixed intently on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo's performance in the first trial had astonished him. In countless Rising Cloud Trials, only a handful of Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators had managed to pass using solely spiritual energy to manipulate threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">If Ning Zhuo were to use spiritual energy threads, Che Zhuzi would immediately tamper with the Poisonous Miasma's composition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">To his surprise, however, Ning Zhuo didn't use Five Elements Spiritual Power threads. Instead, he directly purchased a length of Void Spider Silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Che Zhuzi had provided exceptional service for this purchase - he even included a Jade Slip detailing the method for using Void Spider Silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">After studying the instructions and experimenting several times, Ning Zhuo successfully manipulated the Void Spider Silk to pierce through the void, extending its tip from a distant point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Visually, the silk appeared to have a large section missing in the middle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Using the Void Spider Silk, Ning Zhuo directly traversed the void, bypassing the Poisonous Miasma to reach the Flower Core. He grasped the Flower Stamen and abruptly retracted the silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The Void Spider Silk exhibited remarkable resistance to the Poison Reservoir's toxins. Even after carrying the Flower Stamen through, it showed minimal degradation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Seeing Ning Zhuo's success, many cultivators grew anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">After all, the second trial's rules stipulated that only the top half of the participants would advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Ning Zhuo had been the first cultivator to purchase Void Spider Silk, earning Che Zhuzi's favor while antagonizing most of the other cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Many glared at him resentfully, blaming him for being overly competitive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo had anticipated this reaction. His expression remained impassive, as if their gazes didn't exist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">The cost of the silk was insignificant to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Hahaha!" Lady Spiderweb, lurking in the shadows, burst into gleeful laughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">She had secretly laced all the Void Spider Silk with a hidden poison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ning Zhuo's heavy usage would cause the toxin to accumulate rapidly within his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Keep using it! Use it with all your might!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"Once my poison has taken hold and you reach the third stage, I'll tighten the net."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"By then, I'll make you my dog!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
