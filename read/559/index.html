<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The two armies deliberately avoided the Golden Swallow River, encountering the Red Flower Battalion halfway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"General Mu Lan!" Liu Er's eyes lit up as he transmitted via divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Mu Lan nodded subtly at him, then turned to Ning Zhuo with joy, "Husband, let's fight side by side this time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo wanted to remind Mu Lan not to call him 'husband,' but with battle raging, it clearly wasn't the best moment to correct her. He simply nodded and gestured for Mu Lan to follow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">They continued charging forward!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Military Tactic - Speed is Vital!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Spotting the perfect moment, Liu Er depleted some military strength, causing the Three Generals Battalion's speed to surge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Wood Element - Root Vine Entanglement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo extended his divine sense to the left, casting his spell, and dozens of enemy cultivators were instantly entangled by vines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Good opportunity, fire arrows!" Mu Lan's eyes sparkled as she immediately issued orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Red Flower Battalion unleashed a wave of arrows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Military Tactic - Falling Flower Arrows!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Petals drifted from the Red Flower Dharma Avatar, breaking into countless fragments that rained down heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Aaargh..." The enemy cultivators, trapped by vines and unable to evade, were struck, screaming as they lost their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The three battalions skillfully coordinated their attacks. Trusting each other allowed them to achieve remarkable results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Little Zhuo, Lin You is over there!" Sun Lingtong, hidden within the Mechanical Dragon, continually updated Ning Zhuo on the target's position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Charge in this direction!" Now serving as the central figure, Ning Zhuo's command immediately guided the three battalions' movement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Indeed, Ning Zhuo was now the core connecting the three armies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Together, the joint armies carved out a bloody path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"This is the advantage of having numbers," Ning Zhuo sighed genuinely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">This was far easier than when he had led the troops alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Of course, there were other factors. At this moment, morale among the Two Note Kingdom soldiers surged, naturally favoring aggressive advances. Additionally, higher-ups like Elder Long and Lu Hongtu were locked in deadly battles, unable to adjust formations and positions, thus failing to counter the combined assault of Liu, Guan, Zhang, Ning, and Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The distance between Ning Zhuo and Lin You continuously shrank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Lin You, busy with battles inside the mechanical carriage, hadn't yet noticed Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Look over there!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"We can't let these enemies run rampant any longer!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Intercept them!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A force from Thousand Peaks Forest recognized Ning Zhuo’s strength and swiftly acted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Multiple spells rained down fiercely, momentarily halting Ning Zhuo's charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">It was the Profound Witch Army!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">From afar, Ning Zhuo's eyes glinted sharply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This battalion, led by Nascent Soul cultivators, ranked among Thousand Peaks Forest's top three elite units.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Thousand Peaks Forest hadn't established a kingdom, so this army relied solely on military strength, unable to mobilize national resources. Since the battle began, the Profound Witch Army had remained entrenched, launching spells from a distance with devastating effect, causing heavy casualties among Two Note Kingdom's soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Strategically, the Profound Witch Army closely resembled Two Note Kingdom's Fire Cloud Battalion, both excelling in powerful long-range magical attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">However, while the Fire Cloud Battalion specialized in explosive fire-element spells capable of igniting vast infernos, the Profound Witch Army's techniques were rooted in witchcraft, characterized by eerie and unpredictable attacks, less spectacular but harder to guard against.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"How should we deal with this?" While Ning Zhuo pondered strategy, Mu Lan acted first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Military Tactic - Flower Scroll Enclosure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Red Flower Dharma Avatar divided into two shadows, hovering above the Three Generals and the Mechanical Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Then, it released a powerful suction, absorbing incoming spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">With each absorbed spell, layers of flower petals retracted inward, forming a protective flower bud shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The petals curled inward continuously, absorbing wave after wave of spells, firmly shielding the three battalions below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Red Flower Battalion single-handedly protected all three battalions, showcasing astounding prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">However, their military strength plummeted rapidly and couldn't hold out much longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Mu Lan didn't need to say it; Ning Zhuo, Liu, Guan, and Zhang all understood clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Let me handle it!" Zhang Hei roared, his shout thunderous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Military Tactic -  Overwhelming Army!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He thrust forward with both palms, instantly depleting nearly half of the Three Generals Battalion's military power and his personal technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Blackwater soldiers materialized from thin air, surging forth like a black river, fiercely attacking the Profound Witch Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Oh?" Ning Zhuo hadn't interacted closely with Liu, Guan, and Zhang recently; this was the first he'd seen of Zhang Hei's considerable progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Previously, Zhang Hei could only execute this military technique by relying on his Black Serpent Spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But now, with his spear snapped in half, he was still able to perform it by himself - a significant improvement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Seeing the Blackwater soldiers charging, the Black Tortoise Army was forced to divert their firepower to suppress this group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Though the Black Tortoise Army commander was from a barbarian tribe, his command remained calm, precise, and orderly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Under his leadership, the Black Tortoise Army formed a tight defensive circle, firmly controlling the surrounding battlefield area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">They quickly intercepted and eliminated all of the Blackwater soldiers and were about to redirect their main offensive back to Ning Zhuo's group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Just then, a figure abruptly broke into the Black Tortoise Army’s formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Surrounded by violent, stormy winds with wind blades flying everywhere, this person indiscriminately attacked anyone nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">It was the berserk Chen Lingfeng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Chen Lingfeng was already at the peak of the Golden Core level. Now, having gone completely insane, he fully unleashed his innate potential, elevating his strength to the Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He attacked randomly without distinguishing friend from foe, causing headaches for both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Several people tried joining forces to subdue Chen Lingfeng, but the chaotic battlefield significantly increased the difficulty. Moreover, Chen Lingfeng was incredibly swift and unpredictable, making him impossible to pin down for the moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Helplessly sighing, the Black Tortoise commander could only fully focus on guarding against Chen Lingfeng, temporarily abandoning their blockade against Ning Zhuo's group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Lucky!” Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">A direct confrontation with the Black Tortoise Army would have been highly risky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">After all, this was one of the top three armies within the Thousand Peaks Forest. Ning Zhuo’s Mechanical Army mainly served as disposable materials for the Hero's Return Technique, while his Three-Generals Battalion had only recently been established. Even though the Red Flower Battalion was renowned, it had always been undermanned and thus weaker overall compared to the Black Tortoise Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">They could fight, but victory would be uncertain and losses heavy - even if they won, it would only be a pyrrhic victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Who would’ve thought Chen Lingfeng would inadvertently help us?” Ning Zhuo remarked, gazing towards the battlefield where the Black Tortoise Army fought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong responded, “If we hadn’t driven Chen Lingfeng insane first, we wouldn’t have gotten this chance. Technically, we helped ourselves.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo's group pressed forward once more!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Soon, they opened distance between themselves and the Black Tortoise Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Inside the mechanical carriage, Lin You took advantage of a pause in his fierce battle to glance toward Ning Zhuo’s party.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The distance between the two groups had significantly decreased, making Lin You notice these incoming enemies. However, he remained in place, continuing his intense fight with his current opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Xu Dali took a heavy blow and shot across half the battlefield like a falling meteor, crashing down near Ning Zhuo’s group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Dust and debris filled the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">In the crater, Xu Dali panted heavily, covered in blood, struggling to stand up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But the next moment, an intense dizziness overwhelmed him, forcing him down onto one knee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He was badly injured!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Suddenly - a Shadowless Silhouette emerged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Xu Dali's shadow abruptly expanded, and from it leaped out a Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">This enemy cultivator had a pale, haggard face, disheveled black hair, and wore a tattered black robe. It was none other than Wu Hen - Elder Long’s trusted right-hand man, a figure of equal renown to Chen Lingfeng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Wu Hen spat out spiritual energy, forming a massive pair of scissors in his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He aimed directly at Xu Dali’s shadow, cutting down viciously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">At this critical juncture, Xu Dali instinctively rolled forward, narrowly avoiding decapitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">With a grunt, blood splashed onto the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">A sharp pain struck him; glancing back, he saw his right arm severed cleanly from his shoulder, left behind on the bloody path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Xu Dali quickly mobilized his muscular control, attempting to stop the bleeding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">As a Body Cultivator, his physical mastery was extraordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Yet, his usual dependable techniques completely failed at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Xu Dali retreated rapidly, applying healing techniques, but with minimal effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Shadow Path!” His heart sank - he knew he was in deep trouble. Injuries from Shadow Path techniques couldn't easily be treated by ordinary means.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Normally, he could rely on his higher-level Nascent Soul cultivation to suppress such wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">But now, his condition was terrible. Most of his strength was drained, and the fierce fight in the camp had added over a dozen new wounds to his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">His current combat power had fallen to the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“Hehehe,” Wu Hen took advantage and pressed his attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Shadow Path - Shadow Silk Entanglement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Strange Path - Mystic Threads Seeking Life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">A dark shadow surged forth, splitting into thousands of fine threads, enveloping Xu Dali completely. The extremely sharp threads tightened swiftly, embedding deeply into his flesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"My life ends here!" Immobilized, Xu Dali fell into despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">In the next instant, a scythe flew with precise force, severing all threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Xu Dali narrowly escaped death, momentarily dazed and slow to react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">As a veteran at the Nascent Soul stage, his dazed appearance on the battlefield was proof enough of his severely deteriorated condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">When he finally regained his composure, he saw a mechanical puppet wielding a mechanical scythe chasing Wu Hen, forcing him to leap frantically about.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The Buddhist Healer - Meng Yaoyin!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Immediately after, Ning Zhuo and his group rushed in aggressively, formidable in numbers and aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Wu Hen!" Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Damn it!" Having fought Ning Zhuo before, Wu Hen immediately sought an opportunity to flee upon seeing Ning Zhuo and his companions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Capture him alive!" Ning Zhuo roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Mu Lan glanced at him, took a deep breath, and activated a costly military tactic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Military Technique - Capture Alive!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The net reappeared, ensnaring Wu Hen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Du Tiechuan had previously used this method to temporarily imprison Xiang Yue, yet Mu Lan's attempt proved ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ordinarily, Mu Lan’s profound mastery of this military technique could completely suppress most Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">However, Wu Hen was extraordinary, on par with Chen Lingfeng, practicing a strange cultivation path and holding uncommon advantages!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Hmph, capturing me alive is wishful thinking!" Wu Hen transformed into a shadowy stream, beginning to slip through the net's gaps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Suddenly, Buddha Doctor Meng Yaoyin moved abruptly, the scythe flashing brilliantly, creating dazzling arcs of Purple blade light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The blade strikes hit Wu Hen, knocking him out of shadow form back into his true body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Puh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">He spat a mouthful of blood. Already injured from earlier blade wounds and suffering backlash from a failed technique, his injuries became severe, causing him to fall unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Mu Lan promptly tightened the net, successfully restraining and capturing Wu Hen alive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The ease of the capture stunned and delighted Ning Zhuo's group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Mother!" Ning Zhuo silently exclaimed, sensing Meng Yaoyin’s sudden burst of spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Yet, Buddha Doctor Meng Yaoyin showed no further response, as if the perfect strike had merely been an illusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo hurriedly put Meng Yaoyin away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Young Master Ning Zhuo, I owe you life-saving gratitude!" Xu Dali struggled to stand and thanked Ning Zhuo sincerely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo nodded, casually tossing him a healing pill, "General Xu may follow behind our forces."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He wouldn't integrate Xu Dali directly into his army, as incompatible coordination would disrupt battle formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Similarly, the Three Generals Camp and Red Flower Camp couldn't accept Xu Dali either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Many thanks, Young Master!" Though straightforward, Xu Dali was grateful and respectful toward Ning Zhuo, his savior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Obediently following Ning Zhuo's group, Xu Dali utilized their military presence to catch his breath and swiftly employ other techniques to restore his combat strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Lin You felt tense, noticing Ning Zhuo’s group approaching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Taking this threat seriously, Lin You coldly snorted, sparing his nearly defeated opponent and decisively controlling his mechanical carriage, initiating a withdrawal with his subordinates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Little Zhuo, careful, he's escaping!" Sun Lingtong promptly warned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo nodded, affirming briefly, and commanded his troops to intercept Lin You's movement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Lin You quickly perceived Ning Zhuo's group's intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Suspicion flashed through his mind, "What's going on? Did I coincidentally cross paths with them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo's previous restrained strategy proved crucial at this moment; Lin You could never have anticipated being Ning Zhuo’s prime target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Lin You swiftly scanned his surroundings, locking onto Ju Bing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">He repositioned once more, using Ju Bing's military formation as cover to block Ning Zhuo's pursuit, buying time to increase their separation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Gu Ya and Ju Bing were renowned beast-controlling cultivators of Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Gu Ya controlled wolf packs, Ju Bing managed pig herds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Since the start of the great battle, Ju Bing hadn’t entered the central fray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Though out of character, there was no choice. Earlier fights had resulted in many of Ju Bing’s pig descendants dying at the hands of Ding Pi and Jia Wan, the master and disciple pair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ju Bing's pig herd wasn't large to begin with, so he had always been careful about how he used them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"Hmm?!" Ju Bing furrowed his brows, quickly noticing Ning Zhuo's group charging toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"Since the battle began, my pig herd has dwindled to only forty percent - I can't afford more losses!" Ju Bing began to consider retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The declining morale of the Thousand Peaks Forest Side also affected him, prompting a more cautious strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Thus, his pig herd retreated like a receding tide, clearing a broad path for Ning Zhuo’s group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Ning Zhuo: "Huh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Lin You: "What's going on?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Before Ju Bing fully realized his mistake, Ning Zhuo’s party had already rushed forward, drastically shortening the critical distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">"General Mu Lan, General Liu Er! Whoever captures that person will earn my personal favor!" Ning Zhuo shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Initially, Mu Lan wasn't particularly moved, but Ning Zhuo’s promise immediately sparked excitement in her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">However, Liu Er reacted faster, instantly breaking away from the main force and charging forward alone with enthusiasm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Guan Hong and Zhang Hei exchanged astonished glances, having never seen their leader act so recklessly brave before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Mu Lan snorted coldly: "My husband's favor belongs to me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">She mobilized her battle formation and activated her Dharma Avatar. The crimson flower's true form soared forward rapidly, swiftly enveloping Lin You along with his mechanical carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Combat Technique - Flower Bud Captures the Heart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Her Crimson Flower Dharma Avatar possessed combat strength on par with a Nascent Soul cultivator, previously trapping the powerful Nascent Soul-level demon Ma Feitui. How could Lin You, a mere Golden Core-level cultivator, possibly resist? He was immediately captured alive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Another one captured!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">"We got him!" Sun Lingtong cheered triumphantly from within the Dragon Head compartment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Ning Zhuo let out a sigh of relief, finally feeling reassured, and soon after, profound happiness welled up within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">They had finally succeeded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">Even up to the last moment, Ning Zhuo had concealed his true goal - retrieving the mechanical carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
