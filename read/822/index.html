<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"All things under heaven and earth can be cut."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This was the opening sentence of the Great Primordial Form-Cutting Scroll.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The handwriting in the book was lean and thin, the strokes as clean and decisive as a knife’s edge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo stared at this line, his mind falling into a slight trance - between the lines, there seemed to be a hidden calmness that looked down upon all living beings, as if the writer could use a ruler as a blade to tailor everything in the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo first skimmed through the text to understand the overall structure of the Great Primordial Form-Cutting Scroll.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The cutting techniques taught in the book were divided into seven categories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">They were: Straight Cut, Curved Cut, Stacked Cut, Internal Cut, Void Cut, Intent Cut, and Fate Cut.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">There was no hierarchy among the seven categories, and they were strongly interconnected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Broad and profound!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Truly worthy of being written personally by a Void Refinement level mighty figure," Ning Zhuo sighed with emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After studying it for a while, he began to practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo took out a stack of white paper and placed it before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"When the heart is upright, the line is straight; when the hand is steady, the cut is even."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo silently recited the mnemonic. His right hand, holding the ruler, slowly sank down, aligning the ruler's edge with the edge of the paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He took a deep breath and gently pushed with his wrist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The ruler's edge glided across the paper, leaving a shallow mark - but it was crooked and twisting, like the trail of a crawling earthworm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo frowned slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He clearly felt his wrist was steady and his line of sight was true, so why was the line he drew so distorted?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Another sheet of paper was spread out. Ning Zhuo adjusted his breathing. This time, he deliberately slowed down, pushing the ruler's blade forward almost inch by inch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The line was still crooked, only slightly better than the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The third sheet, the fourth, the fifth...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">An incense stick's worth of time later, over twenty sheets of waste paper were scattered around Ning Zhuo. Each one bore crooked lines; some even broke off midway, as if the ruler's blade had suddenly skipped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo stopped his movements and stared at the imitation ruler in his hand, falling into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Every time I push the ruler's blade, I can clearly feel the minute unevenness of the paper's surface, the direction of the fiber texture, and even the tiny changes in the stress on the paper. These sensations are so clear that I can almost 'see' every instant of contact between the ruler's blade and the paper."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"But therein lies the problem - I feel too much."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">There was no helping it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo's current attainment in Artifact Refining was high enough to give him such abundant sensory feedback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Or rather, I am too focused on these subtle sensations, and instead, I've lost my grasp of the whole. I shouldn't be drowned out by countless details."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He picked up the imitation ruler again but didn't rush to make the cut. Instead, he closed his eyes and first imagined a straight line - perfectly straight, without any curvature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Then, he imagined the ruler's blade sliding along this line, from the starting point to the end point, in one smooth motion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"When the heart is upright, the line is straight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The so-called "heart is upright" did not refer to moral integrity, but rather the mind's focus on the "line" itself, undisturbed by other distracting thoughts. The direction, length, and position of the line - these were what the mind should focus on. As for the texture of the paper, the tactile feedback of the ruler, and the slight tremors of the wrist, those were all trivial details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo suddenly saw the light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He opened his eyes and pushed the ruler continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The ruler's blade glided silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">A perfectly straight line extended from the head of the paper to the tail, unbiased and centered exactly along the paper's midline.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">A smile involuntarily surfaced on Ning Zhuo's lips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He picked up the paper and examined it against the light. The depth of the mark was uniform, the width consistent, without any trace of trembling or skipping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Success."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Straight lines, horizontal lines, vertical lines, diagonal lines... He cut hundreds of sheets of paper, each one as straight as if snapped by a carpenter's ink line. The imitation ruler in his hand became more and more obedient, almost becoming an extension of his arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Eventually, he no longer needed to imagine the straight line beforehand; with just a thought, the ruler's blade would automatically trace the line he envisioned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo began to attempt the Curved Cut.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Curved lines were much harder than straight ones. A straight line required only one direction, but a curve required constant adjustment of the angle during movement. Moreover, this adjustment had to be continuous and fluid, without the slightest pause or abrupt turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The first curve was as crooked as an earthworm broken into several segments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The second was slightly better, but one could still see the traces of piecing it together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The third, the fourth, the fifth...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo's frown deepened. Practicing curved lines was more than ten times harder than straight lines. He seemed to have returned to his initial state - feeling too much and losing his grasp of the whole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"No."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He stopped and closed his eyes to ponder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The difference between a curve and a straight line was not just a change in shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">A straight line is static: start point, direction, end point. Once these three are determined, the line is determined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">But a curve is dynamic: the direction changes every instant. The mind must follow this change at all times, without the slightest lag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"So, I need to grasp the rhythm within it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"The force of the initial cut, the timing of the turn, the lingering resonance of the finish. It's like playing the guqin; not plucking individual notes, but letting the fingers flow naturally with the melody."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Having understood this, Ning Zhuo continued his training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A moment later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The ruler's blade wandered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A fluid arc appeared on the paper, completed in one breath from start to finish, without any stiff turns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He continued practicing. Arcs, waves, spirals... various curves became increasingly proficient in his hands. Eventually, he could even cut out a simple sketch of a plum blossom on the paper: five petals, round and full, with slender and spirited stamens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After a full six hours, the waste paper scattered around Ning Zhuo had piled up into a stack amounting to hundreds of sheets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">His mental energy was dim, and his body swayed slightly; he had reached his absolute limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Although the time was short, Ning Zhuo's gains were immense. His learning speed was far beyond that of ordinary people!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">On one hand, Ning Zhuo had accumulated a foundation in his cultivation realm, so when cultivating the cutting technique, he could infer other things from one instance and get started very easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">On the other hand, during his study, Ning Zhuo also leeched off the use of the Luo Shu, utilizing the technique of "head from the rafters and piercing his thigh with an awl" to maintain intense focus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"But going further isn't something that can be broken through in a short time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo put away the Great Primordial Form-Cutting Scroll and took out the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"I've only just started learning. Although I've successfully mastered the basics, there is still an extremely long distance before I can refine the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo was not discouraged, nor was he disappointed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Because this situation was within his estimation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"I am far from researching the Great Primordial Form-Cutting Scroll thoroughly. Whether cultivating this book will help me refine the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale in the future... I can't see any signs of that yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"But even if it doesn't help in the future, just mastering the skill of cutting will be of deep benefit to Artifact Refining, Alchemy, Talisman Making, and Formation Setup!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">While Ning Zhuo was consulting the Great Primordial Form-Cutting Scroll for the first time, over at Myriad Beasts Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="153"/>
<paragraph index="154">On a section of a broken cliff protruding from the mountainside stood a palace hall. It was suspended over empty space on three sides, with only its back against the mountain body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">There were no railings in front of the hall, only a large expanse of natural blue-grey rock. In the cracks of the stone grew nameless dwarf pines, twisted and vigorous, blown by the astral winds so that they leaned forever to one side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">Tuoba Huang sat in the main seat, his figure like a mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">"Drinking tea isn't nearly as satisfying as drinking wine!" Tuoba Huang spoke in a gruff voice, lifting his teacup and draining it in one gulp, completely disregarding any notion of savoring the flavor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">Scalding tea dripped down his beard, which resembled a lion's mane, and landed on the animal skin cloak at his chest. He didn't wipe it off, merely smacking his lips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">Sitting in the guest seat, Wang Yu smiled faintly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">The Lord of Danxia Peak was dressed in a cloud-patterned Daoist robe as always, with rosy clouds flowing across the fabric like dawn reflecting on snow. His seated posture was calm and perfectly rounded, forming a sharp contrast with Tuoba Huang's roughness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">"Peak Lord Tuoba is heroic. This Cloud Mist Tip indeed does not suit your taste. Another day, I will have a disciple send over a jar of Fire Thorn Brew. That wine is strong; I imagine it will catch your eye."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">Tuoba Huang waved his large hand: "Let's talk business. You came to my door personally today; what is it regarding?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Wang Yu didn't answer immediately. He unhurriedly poured himself a cup of tea, blew on it gently, and then spoke:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">"Has Peak Lord Tuoba heard of that youngster who has been in the limelight within the sect recently?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">"Ning Zhuo?" A sharp light flashed in Tuoba Huang's crimson pupils, followed immediately by a sneer. "His Noble Spirit shot straight into the clouds, and then he publicly returned the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone. Tsk, tsk. Who in the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect doesn't know that big-headed kid now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">He paused, his curly beard raising slightly, a hint of appreciation leaking into his tone: "That old thing Zhong Dao actually picked up a treasure this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">Wang Yu's brow twitched slightly: "Peak Lord Tuoba knows something of Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Tuoba Huang shook his head: "I wouldn't say I know him, I've just heard of him a few times. After all, it's the Flying Cloud Assembly; I also want to recruit some talent for my peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Wang Yu nodded: "Just a short while ago, Ning Zhuo took first place in the Demon Subjugation Hall's second test. But when it came time to receive the heavy reward for first place, he rejected Zhong Dao's implicit invitation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">"Oh?" Tuoba Huang was surprised. "Tell me in detail."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">Wang Yu then recounted the events in detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Upon hearing this, Tuoba Huang couldn't help but laugh loudly: "This kid Ning Zhuo has his own ideas. Hahaha, I didn't expect that old fellow Zhong Dao to have a moment where he eats a loss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Tuoba Huang had been unhappy with Zhong Dao for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Especially before, during the Eight Peaks Council discussion regarding White Paper Immortal City. The Peak Lords had found a method and wanted Zhong Dao's assistance. In the end, Zhong Dao questioned them sternly, making the Peak Lords lose face, and Tuoba Huang had also been embarrassed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Wang Yu smiled. After taking a light sip of tea, he expressed that he viewed Ning Zhuo's future extremely highly, even believing that Ning Zhuo might become a second Zhong Dao in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">This caused Tuoba Huang to frown, his voice turning gruff: "Although I can't stand Old Man Zhong, he is indeed quite special. His talent is unsurpassed, and he possesses great destiny. A cultivator of his strength only appears once every few centuries, even within the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"Ning Zhuo can grow to reach Zhong Dao's status?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Hearing this, a meaningful light flashed in Wang Yu's eyes: "Peak Lord Tuoba, that statement is incorrect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">"Does Peak Lord Tuoba know how Zhong Dao joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect back then?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Tuoba Huang froze, then fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Of course he knew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Like many others, having suffered losses at Zhong Dao's hands, he had collected intelligence on the man multiple times in an attempt to get even.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Recalling it slightly now, he immediately understood some of the implications behind Wang Yu's words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Wang Yu held up his teacup but didn't drink, simply looking at his own reflection in the tea soup: "Ning Zhuo's current performance is not much different from when Zhong Dao joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Noble Spirit piercing the sun and clouds, and taking first place in the second test. Especially publicly declining Zhong Dao's invitation - this is something even Zhong Dao didn't do back then."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Tuoba Huang remained silent and contemplative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Wang Yu continued: "When Zhong Dao joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect back then, no one expected him to have today's achievements either. If someone had seen his potential at that time and fully cultivated him..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">He didn't finish the sentence, but the meaning was obvious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Tuoba Huang stared at Wang Yu, sharp light flickering in his crimson pupils as he chewed over the deep meaning of these words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">After a long while, he said in a muffled voice: "So you came today to remind me to take this kid seriously?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Wang Yu stood up with a smile, flicking his whisk: "Peak Lord Tuoba is wise, why would you need me to remind you? It was merely a few idle words to go with the tea."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">He cupped his hands slightly: "The tea has been finished; Wang takes his leave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">After Wang Yu left, Tuoba Huang sat alone in the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Outside the hall, the astral winds howled, making the dwarf pines rustle. Clouds and mist surged, sometimes submerging the hall, sometimes scattering to reveal the abyss thousands of feet below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Tuoba Huang remained motionless, silent as a mountain range.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">His mind turned over and over, filled with Wang Yu's words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Tuoba Huang's brow knitted tighter and tighter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">He gradually realized that Wang Yu's visit today was absolutely not as simple as "a few idle words."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">The Lord of Danxia Peak had always been deep and calculating; his words and actions always had a purpose. He specifically mentioned Ning Zhuo, specifically compared him to Zhong Dao, and specifically pointed out "fully cultivating" him - this was a reminder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">A reminder that Ning Zhuo could become the second Zhong Dao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">Even if this probability was still small in Tuoba Huang's mind. But what if?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">"If Ning Zhuo becomes a second Zhong Dao..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">Tuoba Huang muttered to himself, a trace of apprehension flashing through his crimson eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">One Zhong Dao was already headache enough. If another one came along, to what extent would the Demon Subjugation Hall's strength and influence expand?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">When the time came, if the situation of the last Eight Peaks Council occurred again, how would his Myriad Beasts Peak have any say?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">"No."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">Tuoba Huang suddenly slapped the tea table, shattering it instantly. His fierce and mighty aura erupted abruptly. "I can't let this kid join the Demon Subjugation Hall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">His thick, lion-mane-like beard and hair moved without wind, and his body radiated a fiery temper, the air seemingly lingering with a scorching aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">"Men!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">"What are your orders, Peak Lord?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">"Prepare a heavy gift and send it to Ning Zhuo in public. I want to recruit him with a heavy sum!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">"Remember, you must specifically point out - this gift is merely to show my, Tuoba Huang's, sincerity. Let Ning Zhuo have no worries and accept it directly. I am different from a certain someone; I don't have any requirements in this regard. Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">Tuoba Huang's temperament was impatient, causing his subordinates to act with lightning speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">Soon, gongs and drums reached the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">A small team of cultivators, riding several carriages pulled by strange beasts, flew toward the Azure Stone Cave Abode with great fanfare. Along the way, they attracted more and more cultivators to follow and watch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">On the stone platform outside the Azure Stone Cave Abode, the envoys from Myriad Beasts Peak opened the treasure chests one by one, revealing the collections within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">The sunlight shone upon them, refracting dazzling, colorful brilliance that made people dizzy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">"So many top-grade spirit stones?!" Many cultivators squinted, stung by the radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">"Is that the egg of a Red Flame Tiger?" The voice of a knowledgeable cultivator changed pitch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">A Golden Core stage cultivator squeezed to the front, staring at a segment of beast bone in one of the chests, his pupils constricting violently: "Did I see that wrong? That looks like the remains of a Soul Formation level demonic beast?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="286">"Ning Zhuo is merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="288">"What exactly does Myriad Beasts Peak want to do? Bringing out Soul Formation level resources for a Foundation Establishment cultivator?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="290">Many people found it inconceivable.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
