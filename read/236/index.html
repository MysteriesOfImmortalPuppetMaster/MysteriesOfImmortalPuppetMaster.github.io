<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Meng Kui nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He quite agreed with Fei Si's concerns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Once such a major incident occurs, his political achievements will be extremely tarnished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This would inevitably be a significant blemish on his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Fei Si requested to personally step forward and negotiate with Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Meng Kui agreed to this request.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Fei Si's letter of introduction quickly reached Zhu Xuanji's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Upon meeting, Fei Si spoke directly, "Lord Zhu, the Golden Core battle has just ended. Even if we wanted to seize the Lava Immortal Palace, we would never want to see such chaos happen again! I believe Lord Zhu shares the same view as us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zhu Xuanji nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He was known for his ability to maintain peace and stability, and as a member of the royal family, he naturally upheld the nation's interests and the people's well-being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Fei Si continued, "The current situation is treacherous. As the acting city lord, I cannot see through it clearly for the time being."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Whether Lord Zhu believes it or not, I came here to tell you: the City Lord's Mansion has never had any Shadow Demon Cultivators, nor have we received any Demonic Dao Scriptures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"I smell a conspiracy. This is likely a plot orchestrated by a mysterious force behind the scenes. They created this Golden Core battle. Their original intention was to provoke a confrontation between us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"However, an unexpected event occurred during the process."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"The Zheng family's mechanical constructs were too sharp, timely suppressing the escalation of the chaos."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Otherwise, if the fighting continued as before, the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City would have been devastated, with the city in ruins and the people wailing in despair."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zhu Xuanji's expression turned serious as he deeply regarded Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Fei Si's feelings aligned with his own!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Because he also sensed something strange and wondered if there was a third party behind the scenes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Given this, Zhu Xuanji also confided in Fei Si, "Whether you believe it or not, the scripture we seized is fake and highly problematic. When Zheng Shuangjun brought the scripture back to the clan's defensive formation, it vanished into thin air."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Moreover, after the carrier disappeared, no content of the scripture was transmitted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Fei Si's expression changed slightly after hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">After careful consideration, he said, "Then looking back, the third layer of rumors is the most critical."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zhu Xuanji chuckled lightly, "You don't need to test me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"The third layer of rumors was spread by us to counterbalance your City Lord's Mansion and prevent any action against Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Fei Si was shocked, "Why would the City Lord's Mansion target Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Then, he suddenly realized and felt a strong chill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"You suspect that our City Lord's Mansion used Ning Zhuo to blow up the Immortal Palace and secretly arranged for Shadow Demon Cultivators in the Fire Persimmon Forest. You suspect that the Shadow Demon Cultivators are in league with us?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Absolutely not!!" Fei Si emphasized solemnly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Zhu Xuanji merely smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Fei Si became somewhat anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">What's going on?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He was always the one accusing others, but now he was being accused?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Fei Si quickly calmed down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He neither argued nor swore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Because he knew there was a deep rift between the City Lord's Mansion and Zhu Xuanji's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Both sides were in an adversarial stance over the contention for the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In such a relationship, no matter what he said, Zhu Xuanji would not believe him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Even using magical artifacts or other means to swear would be useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Because Zhu Xuanji would instantly suspect that the City Lord's Mansion had long prepared a way to nullify the oath!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">After parting, both men were deep in thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Although neither could trust the other, this meeting was still very necessary and fruitful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Both sides achieved their main goal—to control the intensity of their conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Meng family did not want to rebel, and the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family also wanted to maintain domestic stability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">If the Southern Bean Kingdom became vulnerable due to internal strife, it would inevitably attract invasions from surrounding cultivation nations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The current cultivation world was maintaining a terrifying balance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Large and small countries had been exhausting their resources on military preparations for nearly a century.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Deep within the clouds and mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Meng Kui sat cross-legged in mid-air, his eyes piercing blue, penetrating the layers of clouds and mist, overlooking the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Golden Core battle deeply affected him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Like Fei Si and Zhu Xuanji, Meng Kui also sensed a mysterious force lurking in the shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">And this force was using the Lava Immortal Palace to some extent to manipulate the situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Golden Core battle was this force's attempt to provoke a conflict between the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and the Meng family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Who exactly are you?" "Show yourself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Since the last time he observed the tigers fighting from the mountain, Meng Kui had remained still, unmoved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This time, feeling provoked, he acted once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Divine Ability—Sitting Mountain Observation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He activated his divine ability while also taking out talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Great Wind Talisman!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Cloud Raising Talisman!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The great wind rises, the clouds soar, sitting on the mountain observing the pine sounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">No matter how the winds and clouds rage outside the mountain, I sit quietly within, listening to the sound of the pines, untouched by the storm, perceiving the changes in power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Meng Kui silently operated his divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">After a moment, his vision suddenly changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">It was no longer the ordinary scene of the Immortal City and volcano but a strange spectacle of fate energy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He saw blazing flames, a massive Dragon Turtle on the lava stone slab, its head raised to the sky, its dragon eyes full of longing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In the night sky, a giant black bird circled, its feathers blue, thunder enveloping it, with a golden beak and silver claws, extremely majestic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In the darkness, a massive tree that reached the sky and earth extended its branches and roots, its full form unseen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The dark green roots spread, rooted in the lava stone slab, and also in the body of the Dragon Turtle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">A large red fruit hung from the branches, extending above the Dragon Turtle's head, emitting red light, making it unable to lift its head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Blood tears flowed from Meng Kui's eyes, pain emanating from the depths of his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The pain intensified with each breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Meng Kui knew his observation time was extremely limited, so he focused all his attention, scrutinizing the details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He quickly noticed that the Dragon Turtle's limbs were deeply buried in the lava stone slab beneath it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Beneath the slab was boiling, terrifying magma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Buildings stood on the Dragon Turtle's shell, resembling the Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Dragon Turtle wanted to move, to pull its limbs out of the stone slab.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">However, if it did so, the slab would shatter, and the golden-red magma would instantly engulf it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">But if it didn't, the black bird circling in the night sky would swoop down, its sharp claws piercing its dragon eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The roots and branches extending from the darkness would pierce its body, making it a prisoner forever bound here!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Meng Kui's vision suddenly went black.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The blood flowing from his eyes turned into black blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">At the same time, large patches of his hair turned white in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">A gentle breeze blew, and it melted away like snow in the sunlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"So that's how it is!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"The Lava Immortal Palace seems unwilling to bear the burden and wants to break free."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"More precisely, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit here wants to escape. No wonder it has gone mad repeatedly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">In Meng Kui's understanding, the black bird undoubtedly represented him, Meng Chong, and the City Lord's Mansion's forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Lava Immortal Palace and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's fate energy condensed into the form of the Dragon Turtle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">And the giant tree roots and branches extending from the darkness represented the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Meng Kui closed his eyes, healing his injuries while assessing the situation, "The most critical moment is approaching."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"The Dragon Turtle wants to escape its predicament, but it must face three challenges simultaneously."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"The first challenge is the magma beneath its feet, representing Fire Persimmon Mountain. If it pulls away, the slab will shatter, and the magma will inevitably engulf it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"The second challenge is the black bird pecking at its eyes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"The third challenge is the giant tree's invasion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"The red fruit on the giant tree's branches represents Zhu Xuanji, doesn't it? He is the Southern Bean Kingdom's Golden Core Stage prodigy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"He illuminates the Dragon Turtle, preventing it from lifting its head or opening its eyes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Upper Dantian Divine Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The Buddha Heart Demon Seal suddenly surged with intense energy, emitting Buddha light to protect Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"What's happening?!" Ning Zhuo was shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The Buddha light enveloped his entire body, and Ning Zhuo immediately activated the Cloud Concealment Technique to hide himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The Buddha light persisted for a while before slowly dissipating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo was filled with uncertainty, not knowing what danger had triggered the Buddha Heart Demon Seal to activate again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"What should I do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"I probably still have the detection methods of Golden Core cultivators on me." "Is Zhu Xuanji still observing me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo found himself in a dilemma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He had to be extremely cautious in every move, not revealing any flaws.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">According to his analysis, he was likely still being watched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Because Zhu Xuanji had made it clear before that he suspected a mastermind behind the scenes and warned Ning Zhuo not to let his guard down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Given Zhu Xuanji's personality, he wouldn't voluntarily withdraw his surveillance methods knowing I am in danger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">This made Ning Zhuo feel extremely inconvenienced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">From now on, his every move would be severely restricted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He could no longer secretly meet with Sun Lingtong, nor could he attempt to remove the surveillance methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">If Ning Zhuo tried to remove them, it would undoubtedly signal to the Golden Core cultivators that he had ulterior motives!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Under normal circumstances, a young cultivator still in danger would wish for as many detection methods on him as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Why did Zhu Xuanji suddenly want to review my three Dantians?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"After the Golden Core battle, what did he discover that made him suspect me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Did Han Ming get captured?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Or was it the self-destruction of the Demonic Dao Scripture?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">If Han Ming was captured and revealed that Chui Xu Ke possessed Yuan Dasheng's head, then Ning Zhuo had already prepared an explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">But Ning Zhuo knew that such an explanation would have little effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Now that Zhu Xuanji was already suspicious of him, such an explanation might even have the opposite effect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"The City Lord's Mansion's subsequent reactions also need close attention." "Fei Si... is also not easy to fool."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Sigh, the destroyed Demonic Dao Scripture is a flaw!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">If possible, Ning Zhuo would rather hand over the real scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">But things did not go as he wished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">He was already lucky enough to have Yang Chanyu help forge a fake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Regarding this matter, Sun Lingtong had already informed Ning Zhuo through the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Brother Sun must have paid a price to get Yang Chanyu to help."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Although he told me it wasn't a hefty payment, don't I know him? Hmph, he's hiding something from me."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
