Meng Kui nodded slightly.<br/>
<br/>
He quite agreed with Fei Si's concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Once such a major incident occurs, his political achievements will be extremely tarnished.<br/>
<br/>
This would inevitably be a significant blemish on his life.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si requested to personally step forward and negotiate with Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui agreed to this request.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si's letter of introduction quickly reached Zhu Xuanji's hands.<br/>
<br/>
Upon meeting, Fei Si spoke directly, "Lord Zhu, the Golden Core battle has just ended. Even if we wanted to seize the Lava Immortal Palace, we would never want to see such chaos happen again! I believe Lord Zhu shares the same view as us."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded.<br/>
<br/>
He was known for his ability to maintain peace and stability, and as a member of the royal family, he naturally upheld the nation's interests and the people's well-being.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si continued, "The current situation is treacherous. As the acting city lord, I cannot see through it clearly for the time being."<br/>
<br/>
"Whether Lord Zhu believes it or not, I came here to tell you: the City Lord's Mansion has never had any Shadow Demon Cultivators, nor have we received any Demonic Dao Scriptures."<br/>
<br/>
"I smell a conspiracy. This is likely a plot orchestrated by a mysterious force behind the scenes. They created this Golden Core battle. Their original intention was to provoke a confrontation between us."<br/>
<br/>
"However, an unexpected event occurred during the process."<br/>
<br/>
"The Zheng family's mechanical constructs were too sharp, timely suppressing the escalation of the chaos."<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, if the fighting continued as before, the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City would have been devastated, with the city in ruins and the people wailing in despair."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's expression turned serious as he deeply regarded Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si's feelings aligned with his own!<br/>
<br/>
Because he also sensed something strange and wondered if there was a third party behind the scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Given this, Zhu Xuanji also confided in Fei Si, "Whether you believe it or not, the scripture we seized is fake and highly problematic. When Zheng Shuangjun brought the scripture back to the clan's defensive formation, it vanished into thin air."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, after the carrier disappeared, no content of the scripture was transmitted."<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si's expression changed slightly after hearing this.<br/>
<br/>
After careful consideration, he said, "Then looking back, the third layer of rumors is the most critical."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji chuckled lightly, "You don't need to test me."<br/>
<br/>
"The third layer of rumors was spread by us to counterbalance your City Lord's Mansion and prevent any action against Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si was shocked, "Why would the City Lord's Mansion target Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
Then, he suddenly realized and felt a strong chill.<br/>
<br/>
"I understand."<br/>
<br/>
"You suspect that our City Lord's Mansion used Ning Zhuo to blow up the Immortal Palace and secretly arranged for Shadow Demon Cultivators in the Fire Persimmon Forest. You suspect that the Shadow Demon Cultivators are in league with us?!"<br/>
<br/>
"Absolutely not!!" Fei Si emphasized solemnly.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji merely smiled.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si became somewhat anxious.<br/>
<br/>
What's going on?<br/>
<br/>
He was always the one accusing others, but now he was being accused?!<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si quickly calmed down.<br/>
<br/>
He neither argued nor swore.<br/>
<br/>
Because he knew there was a deep rift between the City Lord's Mansion and Zhu Xuanji's side.<br/>
<br/>
Both sides were in an adversarial stance over the contention for the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
In such a relationship, no matter what he said, Zhu Xuanji would not believe him.<br/>
<br/>
Even using magical artifacts or other means to swear would be useless.<br/>
<br/>
Because Zhu Xuanji would instantly suspect that the City Lord's Mansion had long prepared a way to nullify the oath!<br/>
<br/>
After parting, both men were deep in thought.<br/>
<br/>
Although neither could trust the other, this meeting was still very necessary and fruitful.<br/>
<br/>
Both sides achieved their main goal—to control the intensity of their conflict.<br/>
<br/>
The Meng family did not want to rebel, and the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family also wanted to maintain domestic stability.<br/>
<br/>
If the Southern Bean Kingdom became vulnerable due to internal strife, it would inevitably attract invasions from surrounding cultivation nations.<br/>
<br/>
The current cultivation world was maintaining a terrifying balance.<br/>
<br/>
Large and small countries had been exhausting their resources on military preparations for nearly a century.<br/>
<br/>
Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Deep within the clouds and mist.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui sat cross-legged in mid-air, his eyes piercing blue, penetrating the layers of clouds and mist, overlooking the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core battle deeply affected him.<br/>
<br/>
Like Fei Si and Zhu Xuanji, Meng Kui also sensed a mysterious force lurking in the shadows.<br/>
<br/>
And this force was using the Lava Immortal Palace to some extent to manipulate the situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core battle was this force's attempt to provoke a conflict between the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and the Meng family!<br/>
<br/>
"Who exactly are you?" "Show yourself!"<br/>
<br/>
Since the last time he observed the tigers fighting from the mountain, Meng Kui had remained still, unmoved.<br/>
<br/>
This time, feeling provoked, he acted once again.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Ability—Sitting Mountain Observation!<br/>
<br/>
He activated his divine ability while also taking out talismans.<br/>
<br/>
Great Wind Talisman!<br/>
<br/>
Cloud Raising Talisman!<br/>
<br/>
The great wind rises, the clouds soar, sitting on the mountain observing the pine sounds.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how the winds and clouds rage outside the mountain, I sit quietly within, listening to the sound of the pines, untouched by the storm, perceiving the changes in power.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui silently operated his divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment, his vision suddenly changed.<br/>
<br/>
It was no longer the ordinary scene of the Immortal City and volcano but a strange spectacle of fate energy!<br/>
<br/>
He saw blazing flames, a massive Dragon Turtle on the lava stone slab, its head raised to the sky, its dragon eyes full of longing.<br/>
<br/>
In the night sky, a giant black bird circled, its feathers blue, thunder enveloping it, with a golden beak and silver claws, extremely majestic.<br/>
<br/>
In the darkness, a massive tree that reached the sky and earth extended its branches and roots, its full form unseen.<br/>
<br/>
The dark green roots spread, rooted in the lava stone slab, and also in the body of the Dragon Turtle.<br/>
<br/>
A large red fruit hung from the branches, extending above the Dragon Turtle's head, emitting red light, making it unable to lift its head.<br/>
<br/>
Blood tears flowed from Meng Kui's eyes, pain emanating from the depths of his soul.<br/>
<br/>
The pain intensified with each breath.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui knew his observation time was extremely limited, so he focused all his attention, scrutinizing the details.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly noticed that the Dragon Turtle's limbs were deeply buried in the lava stone slab beneath it.<br/>
<br/>
Beneath the slab was boiling, terrifying magma.<br/>
<br/>
Buildings stood on the Dragon Turtle's shell, resembling the Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle wanted to move, to pull its limbs out of the stone slab.<br/>
<br/>
However, if it did so, the slab would shatter, and the golden-red magma would instantly engulf it.<br/>
<br/>
But if it didn't, the black bird circling in the night sky would swoop down, its sharp claws piercing its dragon eyes.<br/>
<br/>
The roots and branches extending from the darkness would pierce its body, making it a prisoner forever bound here!<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui's vision suddenly went black.<br/>
<br/>
The blood flowing from his eyes turned into black blood.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, large patches of his hair turned white in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
A gentle breeze blew, and it melted away like snow in the sunlight.<br/>
<br/>
"So that's how it is!"<br/>
<br/>
"The Lava Immortal Palace seems unwilling to bear the burden and wants to break free."<br/>
<br/>
"More precisely, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit here wants to escape. No wonder it has gone mad repeatedly."<br/>
<br/>
In Meng Kui's understanding, the black bird undoubtedly represented him, Meng Chong, and the City Lord's Mansion's forces.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's fate energy condensed into the form of the Dragon Turtle.<br/>
<br/>
And the giant tree roots and branches extending from the darkness represented the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui closed his eyes, healing his injuries while assessing the situation, "The most critical moment is approaching."<br/>
<br/>
"The Dragon Turtle wants to escape its predicament, but it must face three challenges simultaneously."<br/>
<br/>
"The first challenge is the magma beneath its feet, representing Fire Persimmon Mountain. If it pulls away, the slab will shatter, and the magma will inevitably engulf it."<br/>
<br/>
"The second challenge is the black bird pecking at its eyes."<br/>
<br/>
"The third challenge is the giant tree's invasion."<br/>
<br/>
"The red fruit on the giant tree's branches represents Zhu Xuanji, doesn't it? He is the Southern Bean Kingdom's Golden Core Stage prodigy."<br/>
<br/>
"He illuminates the Dragon Turtle, preventing it from lifting its head or opening its eyes."<br/>
<br/>
Upper Dantian Divine Sea.<br/>
<br/>
The Buddha Heart Demon Seal suddenly surged with intense energy, emitting Buddha light to protect Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"What's happening?!" Ning Zhuo was shocked.<br/>
<br/>
The Buddha light enveloped his entire body, and Ning Zhuo immediately activated the Cloud Concealment Technique to hide himself.<br/>
<br/>
The Buddha light persisted for a while before slowly dissipating.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was filled with uncertainty, not knowing what danger had triggered the Buddha Heart Demon Seal to activate again!<br/>
<br/>
"What should I do?"<br/>
<br/>
"I probably still have the detection methods of Golden Core cultivators on me." "Is Zhu Xuanji still observing me?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo found himself in a dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
He had to be extremely cautious in every move, not revealing any flaws.<br/>
<br/>
According to his analysis, he was likely still being watched.<br/>
<br/>
Because Zhu Xuanji had made it clear before that he suspected a mastermind behind the scenes and warned Ning Zhuo not to let his guard down.<br/>
<br/>
"Given Zhu Xuanji's personality, he wouldn't voluntarily withdraw his surveillance methods knowing I am in danger."<br/>
<br/>
This made Ning Zhuo feel extremely inconvenienced.<br/>
<br/>
From now on, his every move would be severely restricted.<br/>
<br/>
He could no longer secretly meet with Sun Lingtong, nor could he attempt to remove the surveillance methods.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo tried to remove them, it would undoubtedly signal to the Golden Core cultivators that he had ulterior motives!<br/>
<br/>
Under normal circumstances, a young cultivator still in danger would wish for as many detection methods on him as possible.<br/>
<br/>
"Why did Zhu Xuanji suddenly want to review my three Dantians?"<br/>
<br/>
"After the Golden Core battle, what did he discover that made him suspect me?"<br/>
<br/>
"Did Han Ming get captured?"<br/>
<br/>
"Or was it the self-destruction of the Demonic Dao Scripture?"<br/>
<br/>
If Han Ming was captured and revealed that Chui Xu Ke possessed Yuan Dasheng's head, then Ning Zhuo had already prepared an explanation.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo knew that such an explanation would have little effect.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Zhu Xuanji was already suspicious of him, such an explanation might even have the opposite effect!<br/>
<br/>
"The City Lord's Mansion's subsequent reactions also need close attention." "Fei Si... is also not easy to fool."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, the destroyed Demonic Dao Scripture is a flaw!"<br/>
<br/>
If possible, Ning Zhuo would rather hand over the real scripture.<br/>
<br/>
But things did not go as he wished.<br/>
<br/>
He was already lucky enough to have Yang Chanyu help forge a fake.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding this matter, Sun Lingtong had already informed Ning Zhuo through the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Sun must have paid a price to get Yang Chanyu to help."<br/>
<br/>
"Although he told me it wasn't a hefty payment, don't I know him? Hmph, he's hiding something from me."</div></body></html></div>
