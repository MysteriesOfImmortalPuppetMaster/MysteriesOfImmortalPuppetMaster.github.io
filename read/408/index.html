<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The first to leave wasn't Ning Zhuo, but Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Great Ancestor," Ning Zhuo bowed, "For this return to the city, we must be extra cautious and not take things lightly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"The demonic cultivation method bestowed by the royal family this time is precious, but since it hasn't been thoroughly vetted, we shouldn't let Elder Ape practice it rashly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Regarding the dispute over the Ten Thousand Years Fire Essence, the battle will be fierce and dangerous. If improper cultivation leads to chaos, it could jeopardize important matters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Our family's means of controlling Elder Ape comes from official techniques sourced from the royal family. If the demonic cultivation methods also come from the Zhu family, there might be concerns..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Therefore, I humbly suggest that stability should be our priority now. We should temporarily delay cultivation and wait until the situation stabilizes before making decisions. This would be the best strategy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Jiufan listened attentively and nodded silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He had long since witnessed Ning Zhuo's character and capabilities in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At that time, Ning Zhuo, with just Qi Refining cultivation, had spent over ten years planning and preparing, making even Golden Core level Meng subordinates dance to his tune. Meanwhile, he skillfully maneuvered between the major powers of the Ning family, Zheng family, Zhou family, the royal Zhu family, and the City Lord's mansion. Whenever Ning Jiufan thought about this, he was amazed. If he were in Ning Zhuo's position, he definitely wouldn't have handled things so brilliantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">And this time at Myriad Medicine Sect, everything he saw and heard made Ning Jiufan respect Ning Zhuo even more!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo's mastery of the Five Elements realm had already far surpassed that of his ancestor, Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He possessed mysterious immortal talents, gained the favor and recognition of the Five Elements Divine Lord, and received the latter's personally transmitted Five Organs Temple Spirit Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo once again demonstrated his superior social skills at Myriad Medicine Sect. His relationship with Lin Shanshan was ambiguous, yet he still managed to get along well with Ling Hu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Not to mention that Ning Zhuo had Hua Guzi by his side, who was nearly obsessed with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Regarding this point, Ning Jiufan deeply admired him. Because he felt that in his daily dealings with Elder Ape, he was mentally and physically exhausted, feeling overwhelmed and having to give it his all. Yet Ning Zhuo moved gracefully through such situations, handling these difficulties with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Jiufan carefully listened to Ning Zhuo's suggestions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He was quite pleased that Ning Zhuo was concerned about the situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, once again realizing that Ning Zhuo was truly dedicated to the family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Regarding the alliance between the Ning, Zhu, and Zhou families against the Meng family, and the struggles surrounding the Magma Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo still believed that the Tai Qing Palace remained a force that couldn't be ignored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Jiufan handed Ning Zhuo a jade slip: "This intelligence just came through the relay station yesterday."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Following your suggestion, I sent envoys to Tai Qing Palace seeking cooperation, but they were rejected."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"As you predicted, after Tai Qing Palace absorbed members of the Zheng family, they gained control of some positions in the Immortal Palace and have many plans for it, though they haven't acted yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Tai Qing Palace has gathered Zheng family cultivators, so they show no courtesy to our Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The reason was simple - the branch family controlled by Ning Zhuo had occupied the Zheng family's original territory, which made the Zheng family cultivators deeply resentful. They told the envoys directly that if they wanted cooperation, they must first return the territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">This was obviously impossible!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The territory's value was enormous, being the foundation of the branch family's existence. Currently, one of the major sources of income for the Ning branch family was processing Jade Infused Steel. This was thanks to the many refining rooms in the Zheng family territory that could utilize the endless earth fire of Fire Persimmon Mountain. Some of these refining rooms were even superior to those of the City Lord's mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo frowned as he infused his divine sense into the jade slip. After reading it, his brow relaxed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The jade slip detailed more situations. Not only had the Ning family sent envoys, but the Meng and Zhu families had also sent envoys to negotiate with Tai Qing Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Compared to the Meng and Zhu families, the Ning family was nothing. No wonder they were ignored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Heroes of the world were as numerous as carps crossing the river! Clearly, Ning Zhuo wasn't the only clever person who saw the situation clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Obviously, other forces had also realized that this remaining Zheng family power within Tai Qing Palace couldn't be ignored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Given the Zheng family's position, it's very possible they'll side with the Meng family against our clan. But in reality, what we really need to consider is Tai Qing Palace's stance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Based on Tai Qing Palace's geographical location, their sphere of influence doesn't border the Meng family's. From this perspective, accepting the royal Zhu family's overtures is more likely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Ah, let's hope the royal Zhu family can succeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Before leaving, Ning Jiufan also advised Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">On one hand, he encouraged Ning Zhuo, telling him his actions at Medicine Valley were correct and that he should try to strengthen his combat power as much as possible. Mechanical constructs ultimately weren't one's own body; in crucial moments, they weren't as swift and sensitive as one's own power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">There's a saying about having a thread of hope for survival - sometimes life and death hang by a thread, and the slightest difference can mean thousands of Li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">On the other hand, Ning Jiufan warned Ning Zhuo that the world was full of dangers, and sects like Myriad Medicine Sect were special - he shouldn't underestimate what lay ahead because of this. In his upcoming travels around the world, he needed to be very careful and maintain vigilance against others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Like your next destination, going to Ten Thousand Peaks Forest in the Two Notes Country. The Six Caves Sect there used to be friendly with our Ning family and had many business dealings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"More than ten years ago, when our clan relocated, we hoped to get some help from the Six Caves Sect. But they betrayed us halfway, colluding with our enemies to set up ambushes and traps."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"At that time, our clan had left North Wind Country and entered Two Notes Country. We were physically and mentally exhausted, thought we were safe, and greatly lowered our guard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"The Six Caves Sect's betrayal and harm nearly drove us to extinction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Heaven didn't abandon us though. At the crucial moment of survival, we entered ground caves and fortunately found a way out through countless complex tunnels."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Finally, our clan followed the underground pupil river, left Two Notes Country, avoided the enemies' obstacles and traps, and arrived at South Bean Country, which is within Medicine Valley."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"At that time, because of the Six Caves Sect incident, our entire clan was extremely nervous and jumpy. But in Medicine Valley, we received hospitality from Lin Bufan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Sect Master Lin had no prior connection with our clan, yet showed such style and generosity. Because of this, everyone in our clan, including myself, has always felt grateful to Lin Bufan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"This time, although we learned the truth about those years, Sect Master Lin did indeed take care of our entire clan, and this feeling of gratitude and desire to repay still exists."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">At this point, Ning Jiufan's face became solemn: "Little Zhuo, if you encounter the Six Caves Sect in Two Notes Country, you may act as you see fit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo immediately caught the implied meaning in Ning Jiufan's words and nodded: "Great Ancestor, I understand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"The Six Caves Sect is our Ning family's enemy. As long as there's an opportunity, I will definitely teach them a lesson."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Good, good, good." Ning Jiufan stroked his beard and laughed, "I trust in your methods and abilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"However, a gentleman's revenge can wait ten years, and a genius's revenge can wait a hundred years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"You have immortal talent, the future belongs to you, and the entire Ning family will rely on you to support it in the future. Don't lose sight of the big picture for small gains - your own safety must come first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Great Ancestor, I understand." Ning Zhuo smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">This Six Caves Sect was already one of his targets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Because back then, the Ning family had to leave in a hurry, many clan members died at the hands of the Six Caves Sect, and much of their wealth fell into the other party's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Like the mechanical cart that Meng Liyin rode while pregnant with Ning Zhuo - that was one of those items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">In fact, according to what Meng Liyin had said, when she experienced pregnancy complications, it was in Ten Thousand Peaks Forest during this period.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Jiufan needed to return first. On one hand, he needed to make preparations in advance and get ready to receive Lin Bufan and others. On the other hand, he needed to stop by Jade Steel Mountain on his way back to show support for the Ning family's forces there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">With his Golden Core cultivation, making an appearance would greatly help the Ning family's arrangements on Jade Steel Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo then let Ning Jiufan take Han Zhou along, and just leave Han Zhou on Jade Steel Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Before parting, Ning Zhuo had made various arrangements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Hua Guzi would stay in Medicine Valley to cooperate with the upcoming Ning family members like Ning Yong, mainly to look after the Willow, maintain close communication with Myriad Medicine Sect, and handle business between the two parties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After communicating with Han Zhou, Ning Zhuo was willing to let Han Zhou teach the Bitter Cold Scripture to his clan members, persuading Han Zhou to go to Jade Steel Mountain to teach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Han Zhou's strength was considerable, and the Bitter Cold Scripture would be very useful for the Ning branch family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">'My branch family has just been established, and although business is starting up, everything is in short supply.'</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">A large batch of branch line disciples' treatment had become fair, and their cultivation enthusiasm had been ignited, reaching unprecedented heights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">What they lacked were cultivation resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">In this situation, the Bitter Cold Scripture was an answer to their predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Because practicing the Bitter Cold Scripture had low costs but high returns. Moreover, the Ning family members on Jade Steel Mountain were mostly mining and had to endure hardships.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This was a huge bonus for practicing the Bitter Cold Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"This cooperation will definitely be win-win!" Ning Zhuo was very confident about this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Regarding the clan's techniques, Ning Zhuo had his own ideas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He had now mastered the Five Organs Temple Spirit Technique and had profound Five Elements realm understanding, so he could completely improve this technique to make it more suitable for the current environment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After improving the Five Organs Temple Spirit Technique, Ning Zhuo planned to bestow it in stages to those close to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">For example, Ning Yong, who was going to be stationed at Myriad Medicine Sect this time, was willing to switch to cultivating this technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">One day later, Ning Zhuo officially set out in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Let's not speak of his parting with Ling Hu Jiu and Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Zhu Xuanji also had advice for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo thanked Zhu Xuanji for his help, and Zhu Xuanji warned him: "Since you're going to Two Notes Country, you need to be careful. It's not peaceful there lately."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Two Notes Country has mobilized their army, showing signs of gathering a large force, raising the banner of 'destroying mountains and temples,' planning to eliminate Ten Thousand Peaks Forest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo immediately sensed that Zhu Xuanji had more to say, so he asked directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Zhu Xuanji sighed, looked toward the distant sky, and spoke about the national situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">It turned out that Two Notes Country had small territory and weak national power, wedged between South Bean Country and North Wind Country, and had always been a buffer zone in the rivalry between the two countries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Because the ruler of Two Notes Country only had Soul Formation cultivation level, both South Bean Country and North Wind Country had considerable influence over Two Notes Country.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Many forces in northern Two Notes Country receive secret support from North Wind Country, indirectly influencing Two Notes Country's court."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"And at the southernmost end of Two Notes Country is Ten Thousand Peaks Forest. This mountain forest has always been in a state of various powers and forces coexisting in complexity. This is exactly the situation our country wants."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
