<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 224: Heart in Turmoil</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"You all spend your days immersing your souls in the Immortal Palace, excluding me, forcing me to take the path of physically entering the Immortal Palace. But speaking of it, I should thank you all, especially Ning Zhuo. Haha, you opened up a whole new world for me. Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river, never underestimate a young girl in distress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"When I achieve something in the future, standing before you, looking down on you, I eagerly anticipate your shocked expressions!" The more Ning Xiaohui thought about it, the more excited she became, feeling that her days were full of hope and prospects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Especially not long ago, she received a direct order from Zhu Xuanjiâ€”commanding her to fully seize the relevant positions in the Historical Records Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Xiaohui gladly accepted the order!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"As long as I accomplish this task well, I will be appreciated by the Golden Core Patriarchs and catch their eyes." However, at this moment, including Zhu Xuanji, the eyes of the Golden Core Patriarchs were all on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo's previous suspicions were correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Before leaving, Zhu Xuanji had secretly set up means to monitor him, both on his person and in his residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">After discussing with the three Golden Core Patriarchs, the Golden Core cultivators of the three families also secretly moved, gradually hiding around Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Each of them used various methods, setting up means around Ning Zhuo to observe him at all times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">They were hunters lying in wait, hiding around Ning Zhuo, quietly waiting for the City Lord's Mansion to make a mistake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo's Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Under the silent watch of the six Golden Core Patriarchs, Ning Zhuo took out a pill and swallowed it to heal himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After resting, he looked around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">In front of the Golden Core Patriarchs, he performed various detection spells, then used magical artifacts for detection, and even manipulated formations to investigate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In the end, he found nothing suspicious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo was only at the Qi Refining Stage, and even though the magical artifacts he used were of high quality and the formations were at the Foundation Establishment level, he couldn't detect the presence of the Golden Core Patriarchs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo's actions, in the eyes of the Golden Core Patriarchs, were quite amusing and made them laugh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo then summoned the guards outside his house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">These people were former stewards of the Ning family, all with Foundation Establishment cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo instructed them to guard the surroundings strictly and asked if there were any suspicious individuals around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The guards all replied: there were no suspicious situations or individuals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo was alone in the underground cultivation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He sighed, took out the classics of mechanical techniques, and began to study them, frowning as he read.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After reading for a short while, he couldn't continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He put the classics aside, went to the workbench, and started tinkering with various mechanical parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After tinkering for a while, Ning Zhuo sighed deeply again and pushed all the mechanical parts on the table away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Many parts scattered on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo reached out, grabbed his hair, and repeatedly banged his forehead on the table, letting out painful cries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"The little guy's heart is in turmoil."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The six Golden Core Patriarchs, seeing this scene, felt that Ning Zhuo was restless, unable to read or study mechanical techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">His pressure was too great!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo banged his broad forehead until it was red, then released his fingers and lay weakly on the table, eyes closed, like a dead man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He maintained this posture for a long time, then suddenly opened his eyes and sat up abruptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He grabbed his hair again and let out painful howls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">But this time, he didn't howl for long before standing up and pacing back and forth in the underground secret room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">His brows were tightly knit, and his face was solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He walked back and forth, sometimes stopping to sigh deeply, sometimes crying out in pain, as if venting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Sometimes his eyes reddened, and he walked to the corner, pressing his head against the wall, using his forehead to compete with the wall without using any magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Golden Core Patriarchs watched silently, some frowning slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Xuanji's eyes flickered slightly, his face solemn, but he felt a deep empathy in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo's pressure was far greater than he outwardly showed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">His various detection spells yielded no results, but his wisdom had already told him that he was undoubtedly under heavy surveillance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Especially among them, there was a renowned divine constable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Every move he made, every word he spoke, had to be flawless, without the slightest flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Fei Si's letter was delivered in the evening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo looked at the jade slip letter, hesitating for a long time, his expression constantly changing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">There was solemnity, fear, and a bit of resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">It seemed he was blaming Fei Si; if it weren't for him, Ning Zhuo wouldn't be in this situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo finally sighed, gritted his teeth, and suddenly reached out to take the jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He pressed the jade slip against his forehead, continuously infusing it with his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">After reading the letter's content, he sighed deeply again, his face full of worry, and placed the jade slip on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He began pacing back and forth in front of the table again, hands behind his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After a while, Ning Zhuo took out a blank jade slip and started writing a letter with his magical power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He wrote to Ning Jiufan again, informing him that Fei Si had sent him a letter, asking about the details of the day's events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo didn't know what to do, so he wrote to seek advice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Jiufan quickly received the letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">To be precise, he had already seen Ning Zhuo writing the letter and had guessed its content.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After receiving the letter, he infused his divine sense into it, and with just one glance, he understood that his guess was correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Jiufan didn't dare to make a decision on his own and handed the letter to Zhu Xuanji and the other Golden Core Patriarchs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo was merely a junior at the Qi Refining Stage, yet his letter was reviewed by six Golden Core cultivators one after another, showing unprecedented importance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After reading the letter, everyone focused their attention on Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly, "Ning Zhuo, this poor little guy, is already at his wit's end."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Let him reply, just as he normally would."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Since Fei Si is suspicious and wants to delve into why I visited Ning Zhuo today, let Ning Zhuo tell the truth. It will continue to stir the grass and startle the snake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Zhu Xuanji needed the City Lord's Mansion to make a mistake, preferably sending assassins to kill Ning Zhuo, so he could catch them red-handed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Fei Si's initiative to write a letter made Zhu Xuanji a bit worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He feared that Ning Zhuo might reveal a flaw, and facing an old fox like Fei Si, it would be easy to be seen through!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">So, he decided to let Ning Zhuo tell the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After all, his previous conversation with Ning Zhuo was deliberately designed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">At that time, on his way to Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji had already set his goal to make the City Lord's Mansion feel his pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">In the bedroom, Ning Zhuo had already lain down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He tossed and turned on the bed, unable to sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Suddenly, he received a secret transmission from Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo opened his eyes abruptly, unable to hide his excitement, and then he was immediately instructed by Ning Jiufan to act as usual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo went to the study, sat at the desk, and began writing a letter with the jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Following Ning Jiufan's instructions, he truthfully wrote down his detailed conversation with Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Overall, the letter had two main points: Yuan Dasheng and the Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">At the end of the letter, Ning Zhuo deliberately asked Fei Si: What did he know about the Demonic Dao Scripture?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">From early morning, Fei Si sat at his desk, handling various affairs of the Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">His buttocks hardly left the seat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">It wasn't until the crescent moon rose that he finally finished most of the affairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Of course, by tomorrow, or even tonight, new affairs would arise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The recruitment order had brought too many outsiders into Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This brought immense pressure to the City Lord's Mansion in managing the Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">If it weren't for Fei Si and Tui Han working tirelessly, the city would have already fallen into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Fei Si was very concerned about Zhu Xuanji's actions!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">On one hand, Zhu Xuanji was a member of the royal family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">It was now confirmed that he was the biggest competitor in the City Lord's Mansion's decision regarding the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">On the other hand, Zhu Xuanji's high-profile visit to Ning Zhuo, with such a grand entrance, clearly indicated something important had happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Almost everyone in Fire Persimmon Immortal City was talking about this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">As the acting City Lord, Fei Si naturally wanted to understand the real details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Considering his close relationship with Ning Zhuo in private, he simply wrote a jade slip letter to directly inquire about Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Finally, a reply." Fei Si took the jade slip written by Ning Zhuo and infused his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">After reading it, Fei Si's expression changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Demonic Dao Scripture? What kind of name is that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"How would I know about any True Scripture, and you still come to ask me?" Fei Si put down the jade slip, frowning slightly, his mind racing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Is the Demonic Dao Scripture a technique of the Three Sects?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Fei Si thought of the Three Sects' techniques, remembered his conversation with Meng Kui, and the City Lord's Mansion's speculation about the Three Dantian Foundation Establishment technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"If this True Scripture is indeed one of the techniques related to the Three Dantian Foundation Establishment, and it complements the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Then obtaining this True Scripture would indeed be of great help in exploring the Immortal Palace and seizing the position of the Immortal Palace's master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"No wonder Zhu Xuanji rushed over so urgently, clearly pressuring Ning Zhuo to hand over the Demonic Dao Scripture!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"But how did Zhu Xuanji know? Where did he get the clue about the Demonic Dao Scripture?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Since Zhu Xuanji entered Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Fei Si had been closely monitoring his every move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">After all, Fei Si was the strategist of the City Lord's Mansion, and Zhu Xuanji came from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, sent as an envoy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Because Fei Si had been secretly monitoring, he was very curious about where Zhu Xuanji got his clue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Recently, Zhu Xuanji led the Golden Core cultivators of the three families, openly exploring the depths of the volcano."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Could it be that they obtained clues about the True Scripture at the bottom of Fire Persimmon Mountain?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">With this question in mind, Fei Si went to the top of the volcano to seek an audience with Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He asked Meng Kui, who had been stationed at the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain, about Zhu Xuanji and the others' movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Meng Kui knew a little and immediately told Fei Si about the matter of the Mechanical General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Fei Si was amazed, "This time, Ning Xiangguo's sacrifice is truly great!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
