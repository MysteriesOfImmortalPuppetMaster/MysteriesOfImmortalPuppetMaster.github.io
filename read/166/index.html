<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 166: Aftermath of the Viper</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Deep into the night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Kill, kill them all!" "Charge forward!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Take down a Qi Refining Stage cultivator, and you'll be rewarded with a Magical Artifact. Take down a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator, and you'll become an elder of the gang!" The sharp cries of the monkeys echoed as they launched a ferocious attack under the command of the cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The attacked gang was both furious and bewildered, unable to comprehend why the Monkey Head Gang was assaulting them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Don't be afraid!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"We have defensive formations protecting us. The Monkey Head Gang will pay a heavy price for their assault." "No matter what madness has driven them to this, the city guards will surely intervene!" The gang elders and leaders were doing their utmost to stabilize morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">On the top floor of a certain tavern, Ning Zhuo expended talismans to enhance his vision, observing the attack and defense battle with crystal clarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang looked extremely grim, standing beside Ning Zhuo, and whispered, "Sir, if this continues, our Monkey Head Gang will suffer heavy losses!" Ning Zhuo's expression remained indifferent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The battle raged on for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Xiangguo couldn't bear it any longer: "Young Master Zhuo, should we charge into the fray?" Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly: "There's no need."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang felt as if he were in the depths of winter, his body and mind both chilled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo showed no regard for the Monkey Head Gang, using human lives and monkey lives to wear down the enemy's defensive formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">It was exceedingly cruel, like a cold-blooded general on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But he had no choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After admitting defeat, he not only signed a stringent and harsh contract but also handed over evidence of his plot against Yuan Er to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He had no other path but to obey Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The opposing gang cursed vehemently within their defensive formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"They've gone mad, the Monkey Head Gang has gone mad!" "When did we ever provoke them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Why haven't the city guards come yet? Are they blind?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The enemy was intimidated by the Monkey Head Gang's frenzied assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Their strength was inferior to the Monkey Head Gang's; if not for their robust defensive formation, they would have collapsed long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Leader, should we continue fighting?" "If this goes on, our old comrades will all die!" The elders of the Monkey Head Gang approached their leader, complaining bitterly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">They had, of course, considered fleeing or counterattacking Ning Zhuo, but the nearly twenty Foundation Establishment cultivators standing beside Ning Zhuo made them abandon such thoughts as soon as they arose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Attacking the enemy gang offered a chance of survival, but going against Ning Zhuo and his men would lead to a far worse fate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"It's about time. Have the front-line troops withdraw and replace them with the reserve team," Ning Zhuo commanded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Yes, sir," the leader of the Monkey Head Gang replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Wait, use this talisman," Ning Zhuo said, taking out a talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang accepted it with joy: "It's a formation-breaking talisman!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Shortly thereafter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">With the use of the formation-breaking talisman, the defensive formation collapsed, and the enemy gang's morale shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The dead lay where they fell, and the survivors surrendered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"What should we do with these captives?" the leader of the Monkey Head Gang asked Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly: "This gang has committed numerous atrocities. Not one of them is innocent. Hmph, they deserve to die! Kill them all." His light words sent chills down everyone's spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Even the Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Ning family felt a cold shiver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo was only sixteen years old and had lived in the academy until recently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He had shown the world his talent, his diligence, his cunning, and his defiance of the main branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">But tonight's battle revealed the cold and ruthless nature deep within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Shortly after, the leader of the Monkey Head Gang reported that everything had been done according to Ning Zhuo's orders, and not a single member of the enemy gang survived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo clapped his hands and sighed: "Eradicating evil and promoting the righteous path is truly a joyous thing! It's a pity there's no wine, otherwise, we should have a grand toast." Ning Xiangguo smiled slightly and took out fine wine from his storage belt: "I have wine here." Ning Xiangguo poured a cup for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo praised the wine but did not drink it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Instead, he handed it to the leader of the Monkey Head Gang: "I bestow this wine upon you. Drink it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang quickly thanked him and obediently drank it in one gulp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"I must congratulate you, Leader," Ning Zhuo said to him. "From now on, the Monkey Head Gang will take this gang's place and make a strong entrance into the black market." The leader of the Monkey Head Gang's Adam's apple bobbed, his heart filled with mixed emotions of anger and hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Monkey Head Gang had found legitimate work harvesting Fire Persimmons, and after much effort, had cleaned up their reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Now, this battle had undone years of hard work, turning them back into a blacklisted gang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo took out a storage bag from his waist and tossed it to the leader of the Monkey Head Gang: "Your performance in today's battle has shown me the loyalty of the Monkey Head Gang. This is your reward." The leader of the Monkey Head Gang thanked him again, opened the bag, and his face changed: "Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Indeed," Ning Zhuo nodded. "You've lost too many monkey pets today. These Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys will serve as compensation. Serve me well, serve the Ning family well, and you will not be mistreated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Thank you, sir!!" The leader of the Monkey Head Gang knelt and kowtowed, his teeth nearly grinding to pieces in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo had gone too far, pushing them to the brink!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He had the formation-breaking talisman all along but waited until the Monkey Head Gang had suffered heavy casualties before using it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He did it on purpose, to ensure that the Monkey Head Gang's monkey pets were nearly wiped out, then replaced them with Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang immediately saw through Ning Zhuo's intentions: "He wants to use the Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys to deepen his control over the Monkey Head Gang!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The leader of the Monkey Head Gang felt a deep sense of despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">With the contract, the evidence, and the Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys, Ning Zhuo's three-pronged approach left him and his gang with little hope of freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Very little!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He looked at Ning Zhuo, who was only at the third level of Qi Refining, yet he felt Ning Zhuo's overwhelming dominance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Many times, cultivation level doesn't mean everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Ning family's members also felt this deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo's ruthless and decisive methods erased the last traces of underestimation they had for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo then instructed the leader of the Monkey Head Gang: "Go and surround the Crane Beak Gang's base, bring the enemy's heads, and tell the Crane Beak Gang that the black market is now under my control."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"If they don't surrender, they'll end up like these heads!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Yes," the leader of the Monkey Head Gang accepted the order and withdrew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Xiangguo showed a worried expression: "Young Master Zhuo, you said you wanted to take over the black market and asked us to support you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"We can plan this carefully. We can follow your lead for the next few days; there's no need to rush."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"We've already wiped out one gang tonight. The Monkey Head Gang is already exhausted. To fight another fully intact gang... this..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Our control over the current leader of the Monkey Head Gang is solid. We can't easily replicate this with other gang leaders."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Such a force should help us consolidate the black market in the future. The Monkey Head Gang has already suffered significant losses in this battle. Further bleeding them would be detrimental to the overall situation." Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "Uncle Xiangguo, there are no outsiders here, no need to call me Young Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"We are all from the same branch family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"As for the Crane Beak Gang, I judge that they are highly likely to surrender."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"I know quite a bit about the black market and have some plans and strategies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Uncle Xiangguo, just wait and see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Seeing that he couldn't persuade Ning Zhuo, and given Ning Zhuo's confidence, Ning Xiangguo and the others stopped their attempts to dissuade him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo's eyes turned deep as he recalled his conversation with Sun Lingtong before the operation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Brother Sun, this time I will step forward and reclaim our black market!" Ning Zhuo informed Sun Lingtong of his current situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong clapped his hands in excitement: "Haha, wonderful. We brothers worked hard to take down the black market. Now that I'm wanted, it's best for you to take over."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"However, you are a member of the Ning family, one of the three great families. Taking over the black market openly might break the tacit understanding in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, right?" Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "I've thought it through, it's not a concern."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"First, I will try not to act personally. Initially, I'll use the Monkey Head Gang. The Monkey Head Gang has already cleaned up their reputation. I'll use the excuse of avenging Yuan Er to openly trouble them and force them to comply."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"I and the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators will try not to intervene, letting the Monkey Head Gang charge fiercely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Second, I have good relations with the Zhou family and the Zheng family, and I'm also on good terms with the City Lord's Mansion. If it were other members of the Ning family, they would certainly intervene to stop them. But for me to take over the black market, they will only be happy to see it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Because they all want to see the Ning family's main and branch families in conflict and internal strife. Although I will greatly offend the main family, these people will support me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Currently, I've been set up by the main family. On one hand, they dismissed a large number of branch family stewards, and on the other hand, they rewarded me heavily, forcing me to share my cultivation resources, attempting to undermine my prestige."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"I have no choice but to seek another path. I'm still young, and breaking the tacit understanding of the Immortal City to extend my hand to the black market is not a big deal. The other three forces will 'understand'!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Sun Lingtong thought for a moment and nodded, agreeing with Ning Zhuo's analysis: "Brother, you see things clearly. This is indeed a rare opportunity for you to take over the black market as a member of the Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Then let's go all out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong continued to analyze: "To quickly take over the black market, the main obstacles are three gangs and three scattered cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"The three gangs are the Viper Gang, the Turtle Breath Gang, and the Crane Beak Gang. The three scattered cultivators are Feng Heizi, the One-Armed Craftsman, and the Unclean."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Exactly," Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">As Chui Xu Ke, he had assisted Sun Lingtong, spending several years integrating the current black market and was very familiar with the forces and individuals within it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo said: "The Viper Gang has been the most active, especially after you were wanted. They aggressively took over our base."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Hmph!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"This time, I will have the Monkey Head Gang launch a fierce attack on the Viper Gang, killing one to warn a hundred, and establishing our might!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Then, with the Ning family's many stewards and the Monkey Head Gang, we will force the Crane Beak Gang to submit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Sun Lingtong agreed: "That will work! The leaders and elders of the Crane Beak Gang are mostly bullies who fear the strong and prey on the weak. That's how we dealt with them back then."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"As for the Turtle Breath Gang, it will be up to you, Brother Sun," Ning Zhuo said to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Sun Lingtong laughed heartily: "Who would have thought that the mysterious Turtle Breath Gang today was once just a group of beggars practicing the Turtle Breath Technique to enter a hibernation state and stave off hunger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"It was you, Little Zhuo, who saw their plight and potential, and had me secretly teach their leader some thieving techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"These beggars were also resilient and gradually developed into the current Turtle Breath Gang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"I will personally step in and secretly order the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang to stay by your side, both to monitor and to await my return."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang did not know Chui Xu Ke's true identity and had always been grateful to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">On the surface, the Turtle Breath Gang and Sun Lingtong seemed distant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">In reality, the Turtle Breath Gang had always been a loyal subordinate of Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">A significant portion of Sun Lingtong's intelligence came from the Turtle Breath Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
