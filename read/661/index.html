<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Their minds aligned, they decisively activated the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and teleported back to the Black Cloud Battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Black Cloud Battlefield had already collapsed, leaving only the turbid qi barrier enveloping the Altar Battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">However, after the fierce battles and Zeng Jide's theft of the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier from Forgetful River Immortal City, the turbid qi barrier had thinned considerably. Moreover, the passage created by the Void Return Black Sphere remained unsealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon pierced through the passage and flew into the Altar Battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Protected by a formation, the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon couldn't directly teleport inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Seeing this, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, far away in Forgetful River Immortal City, furrowed his brow deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Look! The bone has returned to the top of the altar!" Qing Chi exclaimed, turning to Luo Si and Ning Zhuo. "How did you two guess this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Luo Si remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "It's simple. The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God gains strength during battle, clearly due to the formation's teleportation capabilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Though I can't identify this Grand Formation, I now know it possesses teleportation power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"The fact that the Branch of the Wangchuan River didn't pursue the Heavenly Ghost Skull after it flew away is another major clue."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Combining these two points, it suggests the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord can likely use this Grand Formation to teleport the scattered Heavenly Ghost Skulls directly back here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Qing Chi looked at Ning Zhuo with admiration. "Little Ma, you've become so clever! You're much smarter than before!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo's gaze sharpened as he turned toward the Sacrificial Altar. "The Buddha's phantom has already dissipated, and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord has reclaimed the Heavenly Ghost Skull. We can't let him succeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Otherwise, all our previous efforts and sacrifices will have been in vain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Qing Chi, thinking of her father, her face twisted with anger and hatred. "Little Ma, you're right! We must not let the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord get his way!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Luo Si was already deep in thought, pondering how to break this deadlock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Sacrificial Altar stood silently at the center, as solid as a mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">A Branch of the Wangchuan River encircled the altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Atop the altar rested the Heavenly Ghost Skull, no longer enveloped by the crimson light. Instead, it was shrouded in a layer of hazy Yellow Dust, the remnants of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's shattered form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo once again faced the same old problem: how to breach the Branch of the Wangchuan River!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Compared to before, only the three of them remained on the Altar Battlefield. It was obvious that the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had already ordered his troops to converge here, and his True Form was likely rushing toward them as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo's time was running out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He had to seize every second!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Let's split into three groups," Ning Zhuo ordered after a moment's thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The trio disembarked from the Mechanical Dragon and dispersed in three directions, ready to strike simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">They communicated telepathically, coordinating their attack to begin at the same moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord focused intently, remotely manipulating the Branch of the Wangchuan River to block their paths. He prioritized stopping Ning Zhuo, even at the cost of letting Qing Chi and Luo Si through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"To ascend the Sacrificial Altar, three conditions must be met simultaneously."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Among us, I'm likely the only one who can fulfill them!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo felt a sense of foreboding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom had fallen into this trap, allowing the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord to outmaneuver it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Qing Chi and Luo Si were merely providing cover; Ning Zhuo was the key figure, the only one capable of reaching the Sacrificial Altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had seen through this, focusing all his defenses on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"A frontal assault on the Branch of the Wangchuan River? That would waste too much energy and take too long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Ah, Old Sun also meets the conditions. If only he were here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">At that moment, Ning Zhuo desperately missed Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">On the banks of the Forgetful River:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Cough, cough, cough..." Zeng Jide doubled over, coughing violently. His ghostly form trembled incessantly as he expelled a series of soul breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">His Qi plummeted to its lowest point, revealing an unprecedented weakness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Senior!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed, his voice filled with concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zeng Jide turned his head, his gaze piercing. "You little ghost, you came to Forgetful River Immortal City with ulterior motives, didn't you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lingtong rubbed his nose, admitting frankly, "You saw through me, Senior. That's exactly what happened."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Heh heh! So, you were so eager to steal these Round Stone Essence Cores because you wanted to provoke me into helping you," Zeng Jide said, taking a deep breath to steady his Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Lingtong chuckled sheepishly. "Senior, I was wrong..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zeng Jide waved his hand dismissively. "I never thought I'd be outsmarted by a little ghost like you. Heh, what deep-seated grudge do you hold against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord that you'd sabotage his Dao Path?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Judging by the City Lord's Mansion's frantic reaction, these small stones I stole - and the big one - must be incredibly important!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Sun Lingtong hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zeng Jide frowned. "Never mind. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Our paths have diverged; let us part ways here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Despite these words, Zeng Jide produced a talisman and tossed it to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Affix this talisman to your body and flee directly away from the Forgetful River Prefecture. The farther you get, the better!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Never underestimate the power and methods of a Prefecture Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Our ability to wreak havoc in Forgetful River Immortal City was a stroke of luck. The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was besieged from all sides, leaving him unable to attend to other matters. The entire Forgetful River Prefecture's strength was severely weakened, making it their most vulnerable moment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Seeing Zeng Jide's continued willingness to help, Sun Lingtong's face lit up with gratitude. "Senior..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Heh, you little brat, you owe this old man a massive favor. Perhaps our paths will cross again in the future!" With a wave of his hand, Zeng Jide vanished into thin air, leaving Sun Lingtong, a small child, standing forlornly by the wide riverbank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong tried to contact Ning Zhuo again, but still couldn't reach him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">After a moment's thought, he immediately summoned his Black Blood Paper Horses and galloped toward Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"The task Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin entrusted to me is likely complete. If things proceed naturally... I should now reunite with Ning Zhuo's mother!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Altar Battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Branch of the Wangchuan River surged relentlessly, its currents weaving and flowing with uncanny agility, repeatedly thwarting Ning Zhuo's attempts to break through and completely dismantling his plans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Suddenly, Ning Zhuo grinned and retrieved the Spirit Communication Mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The mirror's beam shot directly onto the Sacrificial Altar, instantly summoning the Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">But in the next moment, Yehu's form was enveloped in a swirling yellow dust, severing its connection with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Damn it!" Ning Zhuo's expression darkened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Luo Si transmitted a warning through divine sense: "Young Master, this Yellow Dust Earth Qi is emanated by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Earth Aspect Incarnation. It possesses the power to corrupt magic treasures and even extinguish spiritual energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth. He was well aware of this, but he hadn't anticipated that the Yellow Dust left behind by the dissipated Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God would still retain such potent power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"If Yehu is affected like this, and I need to cross a vast expanse of Yellow Dust to reach the Sacrificial Altar, how can I overcome this obstacle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">As Ning Zhuo pondered this, Luo Si suddenly acted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He sacrificed the remaining half of the Netherworld Ferrying Line and once again unleashed the Fishing Technique [Nine Abyss Water-Draining Net].</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Now's our chance!" Luo Si roared, manipulating the Draining Pouch to shield Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, seized the opportunity, and activated the Black Iron Han Armor, shooting forward like an arrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">In this battle, his flight capabilities proved invaluable. The modifications he had made to the Black Iron Han Armor were crucial to his success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Branch of the Wangchuan River was blocked by the Draining Pouch, diverting much of its flow through the net's mesh and into other directions. Deprived of its original surging power, the tributary's momentum and speed immediately diminished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Seizing this opportunity, Ning Zhuo charged onto the Sacrificial Altar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"He made it!" Qing Chi cheered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But a new trial loomed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">As Ning Zhuo plunged into the Yellow Dust, he found it difficult to breathe and move. His spiritual energy and thoughts struggled to function properly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Myriad Manifestations Lamp's Light Triggers Its Own Tribulation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">In a moment of divine inspiration, the Prophetic Verse flashed through his mind once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He retrieved the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">This lantern, obtained from the Myriad Manifestations Sect, was the closest thing Ning Zhuo possessed to the Myriad Phenomena Lantern itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">An octagonal prism, it stood four feet two inches tall and one foot eight inches wide. Its domed top and square base symbolized the ancient principle of a round heaven and a square earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The lantern's faint, yellowish light seemed weak, yet it effortlessly parted the Yellow Dust!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This was because the lantern's true purpose lay in regulating Earth Qi on a grand scale, creating fertile land and establishing interconnected field paths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's essence was largely composed of Earth Lung Turbid Qi - what else could this be but Earth Qi?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Most crucially, the Divided Spirit had already dissipated. Even if the Earth Lung Turbid Qi remained dense, without a guiding force, it was merely a natural treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"No!!!" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's eyes widened, his composure completely shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ahead of Ning Zhuo, the Yellow Dust Earth Qi parted automatically under the lamp's glow, forming a pristine, dust-free path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He advanced, his pace slowing with each step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">An invisible pressure, heavy as a mountain and vast as the sea, bore down on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">This was a pressure rooted in ancient sacrificial rites, a force that struck at the very origin of life - the might of the heavens!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The pressure targeted his soul directly, causing Ning Zhuo to experience auditory hallucinations. He seemed to hear the wails, prayers, murmurs, and maniacal laughter of countless living beings!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">His divine sea churned violently, as if a storm were raging within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Rambling thoughts and surging emotions threatened to overwhelm his consciousness, drowning his divine sea and preventing him from thinking clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo grunted, and the Qing-Jiao Army's military might receded like a tide, unable to provide further support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Though his soul trembled violently under the pressure, it began to emit a faint, luminous aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The aura, though small, was as dense and resilient as refined steel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo stood firm as a reef against the raging waves. His pace slowed, his strides shortened, but he continued to advance, inching forward bit by bit, step by step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo felt as if his legs were filled with molten lead. Endless hatred and resentment surged into his body, like billions of festering maggots devouring his flesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This was the Heavenly Ghost's dying curse upon the world, its venomous jealousy of all living things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The malevolent Qi enveloped Ning Zhuo, causing wisps of blue smoke to rise from his body, accompanied by a scorching stench and agonizing pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">With a low roar, Ning Zhuo channeled his Military Vengeful Qi, unleashing a violent eruption. Dense, blood-red baleful energy erupted from his body, fierce, sharp, and brimming with the unwavering resolve of a battlefield commander.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The venomous, resentful Qi was overwhelmed by the Military Vengeful Qi, retreating in disarray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo advanced like a Shura clad in crimson battle armor. With each step, his feet detonated patches of bloody light on the steps, carving out a precarious foothold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The Military Vengeful Qi rapidly depleted, his face flushing crimson as blood seeped from his clenched teeth. Yet his pace gradually quickened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Having weathered the initial ordeal, he gradually adapted to the terrifying pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">His Soul underwent a rigorous trial, becoming several times more refined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Midway up, he recovered Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Meng Yehu was covered in Yellow Dust, his spiritual energy dulled and unresponsive to Ning Zhuo's calls. With more pressing matters at hand, Ning Zhuo stored him away for later attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo finally ascended the last step, reaching the summit of the Sacrificial Altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He reached out and grasped the Heavenly Ghost Skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He couldn't lift it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">A mere skull fragment weighed as heavily as a mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Simultaneously, an icy chill surged from the depths of his being, a bone-deep cold that felt like being judged by fate itself, scrutinized by heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">This is not yours to take.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">You are unworthy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">You have no right!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Crack... crack...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The sound of shattering echoed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo glanced down to see cracks spiderwebbing across the Dragon Qi Jade Pendant at his waist. Dragon Qi erupted from the fissures, surging into his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In that instant, Ning Zhuo's hand shot up, and the Heavenly Ghost Skull became weightless. Caught off guard, he nearly lost his balance and toppled backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The deep blue skull, now inches from his face, radiated an arcane aura that left him momentarily dazed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Watch out!" Qing Chi and Luo Si shouted in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">But the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had already anticipated Ning Zhuo's reaction. At this critical moment, he exerted his full power, summoning the Branch of the Wangchuan River to rise like a dragon, its head rearing up to engulf Ning Zhuo in a single gulp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo had finally fallen into the Branch of the Wangchuan River!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Whoosh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The Branch of the Wangchuan River receded, transforming into a winding river that encircled the Sacrificial Altar, its head and tail meeting to form a complete loop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The string of beads left behind by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had completely disintegrated, stripping him of all control over the Branch of the Wangchuan River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">But he had already achieved his goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Seeing Ning Zhuo drowning, he muttered, "Die, die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"No!" Qing Chi cried, recklessly rushing toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Luo Si grabbed her shoulder, holding her back. "Wait!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"General Qing, calm down. I have a method to rescue the Young Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Qing Chi whirled around. "You have a method? Tell me quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Luo Si retrieved a spare fishing rod, line, and hook, swiftly assembling them and handing them to Qing Chi. "I'll teach you the Fishing Technique!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Qing Chi stared in disbelief, then snapped back to reality. "I've fished before, but... your skills must be far superior. You have a better chance of success!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Luo Si shook his head, revealing the harsh truth. "To fish in the Forgetful River, the bait must be memories and emotions - something extraordinary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"To rescue the Young Master, we must use memories and emotions connected to him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"But my time with him has been too short. Without substantial bait, there's no way to lure him out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"General Qing, you alone can save the Young Master! Don't hesitate any longer - we must act quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Qing Chi gritted her teeth, her heart racing with panic, as she took the fishing rod. Guided by Luo Si, she cast the line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">This step went surprisingly smoothly. Having lived in the dark, damp marshes, Qing Chi had considerable experience with fishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">The tributary of the Forgetful River was relatively clear, allowing Qing Chi and Luo Si to see the hook sink into the water and snag Ning Zhuo's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Qing Chi's heart leaped with joy. She immediately jerked the rod upward, eager to reel her beloved ashore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The hook had caught firmly in Ning Zhuo's clothing. The rod bent sharply, the line stretched taut, yet it couldn't lift him even an inch. Instead, the line drooped lower as Ning Zhuo sank deeper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Qing Chi's heart trembled as she recalled Luo Si's earlier instructions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">She had to use her past memories and emotions as bait to rescue her beloved!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
