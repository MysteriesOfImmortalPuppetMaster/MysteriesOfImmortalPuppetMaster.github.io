<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Little Zhuo!" Amidst the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingtong was both surprised and happy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Although he had never met Meng Yaoyin, when Ning Zhuo was young, he often looked at his mother's picture album out of longing, silently shedding tears. Sometimes, he even slept holding the picture album.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">For such an important person to his own brother, Sun Lingtong was naturally clear about Meng Yaoyin's appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Therefore, Sun Lingtong also, in an instant, only a beat slower than Ning Zhuo, recognized her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He mobilized his divine sense, "looked" towards Ning Zhuo, but the words stuck in his throat, his expression froze - it was the first time he had seen Ning Zhuo with such a demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Destroy, destroy, destroy!" Blabbermouth Ghost General spoke with three mouths simultaneously, his blue-black thigh muscles bulged, exerting sudden force, wanting to crush the head of the paper figure statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">But the statue's head shone with brilliance, not without defense. Blabbermouth Ghost General, for a moment, actually could not succeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He immediately showed anger on his face, clenched his fists, raised both arms high, and fiercely smashed down towards the statue's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Clang - !</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">It happened faster than words could tell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">A golden light suddenly shot out, the momentary brilliance was extremely blinding, causing all the cultivators present to involuntarily narrow their eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Metal Element Technique - Mystic Gold Slash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Metal Path Lung Temple!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The spiritual energy in his Qi Sea was consumed by a small fraction; different from the previous great battle in Two Note Country, after continuously advancing two minor stages, Ning Zhuo's spiritual energy reserves were much larger, possessing enough foundation to support a large energy consumer like Mystic Gold Slash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Fast! Too fast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The Mystic Slash was so fast that Blabbermouth Ghost General didn't even have time to react before being split into two segments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Cut at the waist!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">His upper body fell to the ground, his lower body still standing, feet stepping on the head of the paper figure statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Golden Core level! Who is it?" Such mighty offensive power made Wen Ruanyu both surprised and delighted, he quickly turned his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Although his divine sense covered the battlefield and he already knew this was unleashed by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">But he still couldn't help but turn his head, looking at this unremarkable, yellow-faced young man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Are you Golden Core level? No, still Foundation Establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Did you use some forbidden technique? Or perhaps talismans?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47"> Blabbermouth Ghost General opened his three mouths, simultaneously sucking in a cold breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die!" While speaking, he activated a ghost technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The separated lower body immediately transformed into a plume of dark green smoke, flew to his upper body, connected, gradually solidified, and took the appearance of legs and feet again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Mirror Makeup Ghost General and Butcher Ghost General looked at each other, then immediately acted, surprisingly attacking Ning Zhuo simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Regardless of whether Ning Zhuo used some kind of forbidden technique, or rare talismans, he was an unknown variable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Under the circumstance that Wen Ruanyu could not be quickly taken down, eliminating the variable first was the consensus the two ghost generals reached in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Mystic Gold Slash was too threatening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Even if defending with full power, the ghost generals had no confidence they could completely block it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Otherwise, when clashing with Wen Ruanyu, to be suddenly hit by such a slash released by Ning Zhuo, who could endure that?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The three great ghost generals were all ghost cultivators, their bodies different from living humans, lacking fatal weaknesses in the usual sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But even so, recovery like that of Blabbermouth Ghost Cultivator also consumed foundation, the cost was quite high, unable to withstand it many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Mirror Makeup Ghost General and Butcher Ghost General did not use divine sense to communicate, just exchanged a glance, and adopted the most correct tactic. This action alone was enough to show the two were battle-hardened and possessed rich combat experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"A mere Foundation Establishment, daring to interfere in our clash!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Die for me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Instantly, the two great ghost generals lunged forward, Yin qi surged, killing intent permeated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Compared to the two of them, Ning Zhuo's figure was thin and small; after releasing the Mystic Gold Slash, he just stood motionless on the spot, as if scared silly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Wen Ruanyu's heart instantly leaped: "Not good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He struck with full force to intercept them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Mirror Makeup Ghost General suddenly flew into the air, dodging his interception. Butcher Ghost General, however, had a large and heavy body, and was entangled by Wen Ruanyu's Literature Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Butcher Ghost General suddenly raised his head, looked at Mirror Makeup Ghost General, and let out a low cry: "Switch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The two generals had fought side-by-side for many years, long having developed sufficient tacit understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Mirror Makeup Ghost General immediately held her makeup mirror, facing the mirror towards herself, letting the back of the mirror face Butcher Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The next moment, she activated a magic treasure, causing her and Butcher Ghost General to swap positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Butcher Ghost General, gaining freedom, let out a roar and continued to lunge towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">And although Mirror Makeup Ghost General landed in a situation entangled by the Literature Technique, she also avoided a direct confrontation with Ning Zhuo. If Ning Zhuo still had the ability to execute a second Mystic Gold Slash, striking the thick-skinned Butcher Ghost General was definitely better than striking Mirror Makeup Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This was an excellent choice for tactical positioning in actual combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Wen Ruanyu still wanted to act, to support Ning Zhuo, but Mirror Makeup Ghost General, in turn, entangled him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Run quickly!" Wen Ruanyu anxiously transmitted via divine sense, attempting to startle Ning Zhuo who was standing frozen on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Butcher Ghost General had already rushed to within a dozen steps of Ning Zhuo, couldn't help but burst into wild laughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Wen Ruanyu exerted his full strength, his offensive power suddenly intensifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">His individual combat power naturally surpassed that of every Golden Core ghost general. Mirror Makeup Ghost General couldn't withstand it, immediately shouted delicately: "Blabbermouth, come over to help!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die." Blabbermouth Ghost General still remained in place, continuously speaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Mirror Makeup Ghost General was about to curse, but suddenly her face showed a strange color, all because her divine sense covered the battlefield, she discovered: although Blabbermouth Ghost General had recovered, he was still sitting on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He stared at the distant Ning Zhuo, his whole body breaking out in a cold sweat, even trembling slightly, his face terrified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Could it be when he said 'Gonna die', he didn't mean this kid is gonna die, but that we are gonna die?" Mirror Makeup Ghost fell into shocked suspicion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">She knew very well, among her comrades, Blabbermouth Ghost General's spiritual perception was the most acute, skilled at sensing danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Be careful!" She quickly warned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A beat too slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Butcher Ghost General had already rushed right in front of Ning Zhuo, like an out-of-control carriage, directly ramming towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">According to Ning Zhuo's small frame, not even reaching thirty percent of Butcher Ghost General's physique, if he were truly hit squarely, he would likely be smashed to pieces, sent flying high, and die vomiting blood in mid-air!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Wen Ruanyu couldn't help but narrow his eyes, unable to bear seeing Ning Zhuo's miserable state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">But the next moment, a mirror light flashed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">A red copper "city wall" suddenly blocked the path of Butcher Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Looking closely, it was a mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">What an ape!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">It rose from the ground nearly two zhang, like a small building, its imposing body robust, not inferior to Butcher Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Cast from myriad-strike mystic iron, red sun copper guarding its entire body, diamond-made fangs as long as half an adult's arm, wind-fire wheels inlaid in its calves with a diameter exceeding six chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Mechanism Heart Sphere Furnace activated within the ape's body, driving high-temperature airflow to begin erupting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Blood Oil Bottle and Blood Spring Pot formed a cycle in its abdomen, emitting a faint blood mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">It was precisely Heavy Armored Blood Ape · Dasheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Butcher Ghost General solidly crashed into Yuan Dasheng's chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Yuan Dasheng took one step back, completely neutralizing the impact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Instead, Butcher Ghost General was hit until his head spun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Yuan Dasheng delivered an uppercut, striking Butcher Ghost General's abdomen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Butcher Ghost General took this hit, immediately bent over, opened his mouth wide, glared fiercely, his eyeballs almost popping out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He quickly brandished his butcher knife, striking back randomly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Yuan Dasheng sidestepped, then turned, smoothly elbowing out like a spear, directly hitting Butcher Ghost General's face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Instantly, Butcher Ghost General's head snapped back violently, his face dented by the heavy blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Yuan Dasheng took a stance, directly throwing a kick out</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">As he exerted force, the wind-fire wheels on his calves suddenly spun, bringing up a trail of fire, causing his leg strength to double explosively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Another muffled sound, Yuan Dasheng kicked Butcher Ghost General flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Bang bang bang......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Butcher Ghost General flew backwards all the way, knocking down two walls, and numerous facilities in the workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Then, he was buried amidst the collapsed wall bricks and stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Wen Ruanyu's held heart immediately relaxed, he felt quite fortunate: "Almost forgot, Jiao Ma was hiding a Golden Core level mechanical puppet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"This Golden Core level mechanism is truly ferocious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Butcher Ghost General roared, the sound wave shattering the dust and smoke, walking out with large strides, filled with anger and hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Yuan Dasheng, however, had already lunged before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Bang bang bang......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">A series of attacks landed on Butcher Ghost General's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The butcher knife held by Butcher Ghost General had already slipped from his hand during the backward flight just now; he, without any scruples, used fists and feet to fight fiercely with Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The two sides exchanged blows, each punch and kick was powerful and heavy, creating deafening impact sounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">On the surface of the Mechanical Heart Sphere Furnace inside the Heavy Armored Blood Ape · Dasheng, twenty-seven bronze cylinders rapidly extended and retracted like living beings, crimson fire essence was continuously consumed, large amounts of steam rose up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The nested wind-fire wheels in its calves spun rapidly, emitting whistling wind sounds, curling up tails of flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">As the fight went on, Butcher Ghost General fell into a disadvantageous position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Damn it! This mechanical ape's martial combat ability is higher than mine?!" Butcher Ghost General was extremely surprised, wanting to turn the tables, but was always seen through in advance by the mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Good control!" Wen Ruanyu, while entangled in battle with Mirror Makeup Ghost General, took in the battle situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">In his view: Yuan Dasheng was obviously a mechanism; being able to display such profound martial combat ability was all thanks to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Jiao Ma is actually a mechanical arts cultivator?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"This doesn't quite match the intelligence." Wen Ruanyu sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ghost Technique - Underworld Soul Cast Iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Butcher Ghost General cried out, performed the ghost technique, his overall defense greatly increased. Yuan Dasheng's punches and kicks hitting him produced sounds of metal striking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Mirror Makeup Ghost General was startled: "He actually forced out this ghost technique from Butcher. But that's fine too, with this enhancement, victory is certain!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Mirror Makeup Ghost General knew this was a powerful trump card of her comrade. In many past instances of fighting side-by-side, she had seen the formidability of this technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Indeed, with the stance of this technique, Yuan Dasheng's attacks instantly became ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Butcher Ghost General was just about to turn the situation around, vent his anger properly, when he was unexpectedly hit by a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Wood Element - Root Vine Entanglement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Wood Path Liver Temple!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Emerald green vines drilled out from the ground, directly entangling Butcher Ghost General on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Butcher Ghost General couldn't move and was forced to release another ghost technique, forcefully cutting the green vines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">But although the green vines were severed, the parts wrapped around Butcher Ghost General's body writhed like snakes and pythons, binding his arms, pulling at his thighs, causing his every move to be greatly distorted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">As a result, Butcher Ghost General's openings reappeared, easily handled by Yuan Dasheng, beaten until clanging sounds echoed, reduced to a punching bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"How could this be?!" Mirror Makeup Ghost General was greatly shocked, this was extremely inconsistent with her expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo merely released one Wood Element technique, and easily thwarted Butcher Ghost General's scheme to turn the tables.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Within the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingtong felt deeply moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">He seemed to see, within the Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo coordinating with Yuan Dasheng just like this to pass the trials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"How long has it been? Little Zhuo's strength has grown to this stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"The progress is too great!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"The Ghost General is a Golden Core, yet beaten by the combination of one person and one ape, completely unable to fight back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Seeing the performance of Ning Zhuo and Yuan Dasheng, Wen Ruanyu was clearly invigorated, thinking to himself: "We can win! I see the chance for victory!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Didn't expect this kid Jiao Ma's combat power to be actually so formidable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"The City Lord is wise, she must have recognized this child was extraordinary, that's why she indulged him, letting him come here to the South City Gate to investigate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Thinking of this, Wen Ruanyu immediately transmitted via divine sense, giving to Ning Zhuo: "Jiao Ma, how long can you maintain this state?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"If you can hold on, I can repel the other two Golden Core ghost generals."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"If this battle is won, I will personally report to the City Lord, to commend your merits!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Ning Zhuo slightly turned his head, gazed at Wen Ruanyu, transmitted via thought: "Step aside."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Wen Ruanyu: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The next moment, a Mystic Gold Slash grazed past his shoulder, directly slicing through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Wen Ruanyu's eyes were filled with a sheet of golden yellow, all afterimages left by the Mystic Gold Slash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"Hey! Jiao Ma, young man! You almost slashed me!" Wen Ruanyu was flustered and exasperated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Mirror Makeup Ghost General was also startled. She was entangled in battle with Wen Ruanyu, quite close, the second Mystic Gold Slash also posed a strong threat to her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Fortunately, I kept part of my attention, closely watching this kid, and dodged in time... No!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Mirror Makeup Ghost General looked towards another direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">There, Blabbermouth Ghost General was split into two, divided into left and right pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Ah, ah, ah!" Blabbermouth Ghost General shouted three times, recovering with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">But even after restoring his body, he was somewhat dimmer than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"Terrifying, terrifying, terrifying!" Blabbermouth Ghost General was deeply provoked, disregarding the cost, shockingly unleashed a trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Ghost Technique - Ghost Bat Tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Yin qi surged explosively from his entire body, transforming into a surging tide of Yin qi. Within this tide, countless ghost bats flew out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The scale of the ghost bats was numerous, momentarily obscuring the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Mirror Makeup Ghost General saw the opportunity, fully entangled Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">On the other side, Yuan Dasheng was locked in an inseparable fight with Butcher Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The vast majority of the ghost bats descended from the sky, all lunging towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Ning Zhuo slowly raised his head, his eyes, tranquil as a deep pool, clearly reflected the countless ghost bats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">The ghost bats shrieked, swooping down, carrying chilling killing intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Ning Zhuo neither dodged nor evaded, slowly opening his arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Fire Element - Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Fire Element Heart Temple!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">In an instant, flames surged, blazing fiercely, rapidly spreading across most of the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Three fire dragons condensed their forms from the sea of fire, the air was severely distorted, the paving bricks on the ground were burned red hot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">The fire dragons roared, lunging towards the sky full of ghost bats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">The crimson color, with an incomparably fierce and unrestrained posture, swiftly overwhelmed the gloom and black tide, becoming the dominant color occupying this battlefield!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">Flames were everywhere!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">The floor bricks were burned until melting, the ghost bats vanished like smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">The fire dragons struck precisely, one dragon per general, sweeping the three ghost generals in respectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">The three ghost generals, seeing such a vast and mighty fire, already knew it was bad, but their retreat speed couldn't match the speed of the fire dragons' attack, all were burned until they screamed miserably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">Wen Ruanyu was forced to flee this battlefield, seeing such a fiery situation, couldn't help but become bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">The remaining craftsmen were also forced into a corner, one of them shouted: "No, this is the workshop, using such a technique, everything will be burned down!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">Wen Ruanyu heard, his heart immediately tightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">He quickly prepared to act, to save whatever he could, especially the paper figure statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">"Hiss......"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">The next moment, facing the blazing fire, Wen Ruanyu actually took in a cold breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">All because he observed carefully, only then discovering that in this sea of fire, the fire's momentum was fierce, yet completely orderly. Even including those three fire dragons, despite their magnificent aura, every move had a fixed measure, the flames converged, never scorching the paper figure statue even a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">"What kind of fine control is this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">"This is a Fire Element technique!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">At this moment, Wen Ruanyu's heart stirred: "Is this Jiao Ma really Jiao Ma?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="349">The flames dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="351">The three ghost generals were all burned to the brink of death, bound by streams of water all over their bodies, unable to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="353">"Fire Element turning to Water Element?! Hiss......" Wen Ruanyu inwardly sucked in another cold breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="355">Ning Zhuo slowly walked over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="357">Wen Ruanyu had a solemn expression, looking at Ning Zhuo with new eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="359">Ning Zhuo stretched out a hand, the water streams advanced, bringing the three captured ghost generals before Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="361">Ning Zhuo glanced at Butcher Ghost General and Mirror Makeup Ghost General, then fixed his gaze on Blabbermouth Ghost General's expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="363">"Spare me, spare me, spare me." Blabbermouth Ghost General yelled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="365">Ning Zhuo was expressionless, lightly crooked a finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="367">The next moment, the water streams, like blades, scraped across Blabbermouth Ghost General's entire body, cutting off pieces of his flesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="369">"Ahhh......" Blabbermouth Ghost General let out painful wails, convulsing uncontrollably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="371">Butcher Ghost General struggled forcefully, Mirror Makeup Ghost General tightly pressed her lips together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="373">Ning Zhuo extended a second finger, releasing a Metal Path technique, causing hundreds and thousands of golden needles to continuously pierce through Blabbermouth Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="375">"Pain, pain, pain!" Blabbermouth Ghost General shouted until his voice was hoarse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="377">Ning Zhuo then cast an Earth path technique, stacking it onto one side of Blabbermouth Ghost General's body, crushing half of his ghost body into powder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="379">Blabbermouth Ghost General could no longer make a sound, his eyes rolled back, fainting away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="381">Unconsciously, Butcher Ghost General had already stopped struggling; Mirror Makeup Ghost General saw Ning Zhuo's gaze turn towards her, her body trembled slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="383">Ning Zhuo, however, turned his head to look at Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="385">As Wen Ruanyu was walking over, his heart tightened. He clasped his fist in thanks, completely lacking the previous attitude of a Golden Core looking down on a Foundation Establishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="387">Ning Zhuo remained unmoved while facing the thanks, then he finally cast his gaze onto the head of the paper figure statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="389">"Who is this?" Ning Zhuo, worried about misunderstanding, asked knowingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="391">Wen Ruanyu was momentarily surprised: "Are you talking about Senior Sister Meng?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
