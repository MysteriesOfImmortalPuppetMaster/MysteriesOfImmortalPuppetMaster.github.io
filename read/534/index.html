“Cough, cough, cough!”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan knelt on one knee in a pool of blood, continuously coughing up blood, utterly debilitated. Not far from him, the Cuihong Sword had already been broken into three pieces. Gao Cuo still hid in the dark, his face looking extremely grim, as pale as paper.<br/>
<br/>
Sword Elder’s voice came: “You have ingested the Tianmo Pill, which has granted you combat power beyond limits. Now the effect is nearly over, and you must quickly find a place to meditate; otherwise, you will fall into an extreme state of weakness, and it may even result in damage to your Nascent Soul and a reduction in your cultivation.”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo took a deep breath; in the reflection of his right eye, he saw Lin Bufan’s figure: “This man is so skilled in healing injuries; if I had a weapon for attack, I would surely take his head!”<br/>
<br/>
“Fight one last time!”<br/>
<br/>
Spell -Errant Shadow Kill!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, in Lin Bufan’s vision, the heavens and earth trembled, forming countless shadows. Tree shadows, cloud shadows, mountain shadows, and even Lin Bufan’s own shadow interwove and converged, surging toward him to attack. <br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan gritted his teeth, sat in a cross-legged position on the ground, and with great difficulty formed his seals. His Nascent Soul was exceedingly dim, and it squeezed out its last remaining spiritual energy, condensing into countless streams of emerald light that formed into the shape of armor to protect him.<br/>
<br/>
“Not enough!”<br/>
<br/>
After Lin Bufan and Gao Cuo had battled for a long time and, fully aware of the enemy’s spell power, he immediately took out a seed from his storage ring. The seed was directly implanted into his abdomen, taking root and sprouting in his flesh, and quickly growing vines. The blue and red intermingled vines enriched the emerald light armor, making its form and spirit one.<br/>
<br/>
“Red vines, green armor!”<br/>
<br/>
The overlapping errant shadows twisted around the armor, continuously grinding, emitting a sizzling sound. The armor was cut into countless fragments, yet with the surging emerald light, it rapidly recovered. A stalemate formed between the two sides.<br/>
<br/>
“This fellow only focuses on defending himself; even if I left this battlefield, I still wouldn’t be able to cause him any further interference.” Gao Cuo silently gritted his teeth; his own spiritual energy had reached its limit, and he could only keep holding on. He bet that Lin Bufan’s remaining spiritual energy was no greater than his own. If Lin Bufan lost the bet, he would meet a miserable death on the spot, but if he lost, he could still withdraw calmly.<br/>
<br/>
However, just as this battle was about to decide the final victory, a scarlet rainbow sliced across the high sky. The scarlet rainbow suddenly paused, uttered a soft “hey,” and descended. “This place is strange!”<br/>
<br/>
Within the scarlet rainbow, a figure gradually came into focus: it was a female cultivator with a plump and robust build, tall and mighty, adorned in a grand red palace-style dress with a large skirt. Gao Cuo immediately recognized her: “Red Sleeve Immortal? Damn.”<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, Red Sleeve Immortal directly cast her spell, bombarding the unremarkable valley below. Gao Cuo was already at the end of his rope; if his strength were normal, he could have still relied on illusion techniques to continue concealing, but at this moment he was powerless, and he could only watch as his illusions were broken, restoring the true appearance of this battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Sword Elder sighed deeply: “I did not expect Red Sleeve to be able to pierce your illusion, not simple at all! She specializes in the Giant Force Mountain-Moving Technique, a skill that normally would not have such might. She must have a valuable treasure on her.”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo gritted his teeth, with blood oozing from the corner of his mouth, and finally glanced at Lin Bufan: “Withdraw!” The moment he moved, it immediately alerted Red Sleeve Immortal, who looked toward Gao Cuo’s position in confusion.<br/>
<br/>
“Hmm?”<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, spells rained down like a violent downpour. Gao Cuo immediately activated talismans and his escape techniques, his speed surging, and in the blink of an eye he had flown to the edge of the sky. Seeing his speed, Red Sleeve Immortal showed a look of astonishment. She did not give chase, and instead landed in front of Lin Bufan. Lin Bufan wanted to resist, but was forcefully controlled by Red Sleeve Immortal and captured alive on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
“Wait a moment.”<br/>
<br/>
“This Immortal, I have boundless wealth. Could you spare my life so that I may repay you with my riches?”<br/>
<br/>
But unexpectedly, Red Sleeve Immortal smiled and conveyed her divine message: “Lin Bufan?”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan was slightly stunned. In the next moment, he was rendered unconscious by Red Sleeve Immortal. When he awoke again, he found himself located in a natural cave. Heavy footsteps resounded, and then the enormous Red Sleeve Immortal, carrying a bowl of porridge, walked past the corner of the cave, entering Lin Bufan’s view. “Drink this bowl of porridge, and your injuries will rapidly heal,” she said. Though built in a rough, burly manner, her voice was very delicate.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan looked at the spiritual porridge and, for a moment, could not discern Red Sleeve Immortal’s intentions; while he was pondering, another cultivator also entered his sight. Seeing the newcomer, Lin Bufan happily exclaimed: “Divine Inspector Zhu!”<br/>
<br/>
The newcomer was none other than Zhu Xuanji. Zhu Xuanji nodded with a smile to Lin Bufan: “Master Lin told me that it would be easy to find you.” Lin Bufan immediately relaxed, realizing that he had been rescued by Zhu Xuanji. With lingering apprehension, he said, “I’ve encountered a master; I’ve only ever seen such an illusion technique once in my life -truly extraordinary.”<br/>
<br/>
He briefly recounted his battle process. Basically, in this battle, Lin Bufan had been in an extremely passive position. Gao Cuo’s Lost Form, Errant Shadow had caused Lin Bufan to suffer immensely. There were even several instances when his flying sword shot toward himself.<br/>
<br/>
“Ashamed!”<br/>
<br/>
“This fellow nearly drove me to the brink of death, yet I didn’t even know what he looked like, whether he was a man or a woman.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan sighed deeply, accepted the spiritual porridge offered by Red Sleeve Immortal, and took a small sip.<br/>
<br/>
Red Sleeve Immortal said, “The battle of Thousand Peak Forest has attracted too many cultivators. It is not surprising that some top experts are present; Master Lin, surviving a near-death calamity, is bound to have future fortune.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji displayed a grave expression: “To have forced Master Lin to such a state, this person’s methods are exceptional; he is indeed a top expert among the Nascent Soul level cultivators.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, he had concealed himself from start to finish, which perhaps indicates that he has another identity. If not one of the orthodox cultivators outside Thousand Peak Forest, then he must be some figure within Thousand Peak Forest. Let’s not concern ourselves with him. Master Lin, recover as quickly as possible -we have even more urgent matters to attend to!”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan gulped down the spiritual porridge while looking at Zhu Xuanji in puzzlement.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said, “The Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts have gone to ambush the Three Generals Camp; they have the intention of capturing Ning Zhuo alive.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan immediately lost his color: “The Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts are strong cultivators at the Nascent Soul level, renowned far and wide. Even one of them individually has combat power far exceeding that of the mysterious foe who nearly killed me. Even if Ning Zhuo was stronger, his combat power is only at the Golden Core level; how could he possibly withstand the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said, “So, we must quickly go to reinforce them.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan hesitantly looked toward Zhu Xuanji and Red Sleeve Immortal: “Is it just the three of us?”<br/>
<br/>
Thousand Vine Talisman Corridor.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s mechanical troops targeted the left path, pushing across it. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, disregarding sacrifice and bolstering his battle formation, had his mechanical troops advance with momentum akin to splitting bamboo! <br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Camp marched on the mountain, slowly trailing along the corridor. Whenever Ning Zhuo invaded the next segment of the corridor from within and gained control, the vine-leaf talismans outside the corridor would lose their responsiveness and no longer provide any defense. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the Three Generals Camp merely followed, while Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning, the four of them, kept in close contact through instruments powered by spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, an abnormality suddenly occurred. Behind Ning Zhuo, a faint blue icy mist suddenly emerged. <br/>
<br/>
From the mist, a white bone claw extended, striking toward Ning Zhuo’s back. In that instant, as if he had eyes on his back, Ning Zhuo rolled forward, evading the bone claw. <br/>
<br/>
His divine sense radiated in all directions, enveloping the entire mechanical army, naturally allowing him to see behind him. However, even if his divine sense detected it, his own ability alone was insufficient to avoid it. <br/>
<br/>
In the span of a single breath, the mechanical ring in Ning Zhuo’s hand gave him a strong warning, making him extremely vigilant. That was the main reason he was able to evade the sneak attack.<br/>
<br/>
However, even though Ning Zhuo evaded the first strike, he was still in danger. He had just rolled about three steps away, and then icy mist appeared on both his left and right sides, from which two white bone skeletons emerged. The three skeletons all emanated an aura of Golden Core level and launched an assault on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
In a critical moment, Ning Zhuo frantically dodged, while also summoning his mechanical fists and kicks to cover his defensive gaps. The aid of the Warrior’s Return Technique had already raised his combat power to the Golden Core level. The close-combat techniques he had diligently practiced in the Myriad Medicine Sect enabled him to evade most of the attacks. <br/>
<br/>
For the remaining assaults, he relied on his mechanical fists and boots to compensate for the gaps in his defense.<br/>
<br/>
Bang, bang, bang.<br/>
<br/>
The quality of these mechanical fists and boots was not high -they were made by Ning Zhuo back when he was in the Myriad Medicine Sect. <br/>
<br/>
After a few rounds, they were all eliminated, shattered into pieces and scattered on the ground. The entire inner wall of the Thousand Vine Talisman Corridor was densely scarred with claw marks, most of which were translucent. These ambushing skeleton assassins, whose attack was restrained yet vicious and treacherous, found the corridor’s very material, which was of Golden Core-level quality, easily clawed open.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the three white bones halted in place, extended their arms, and aimed their palms at Ning Zhuo. Ning Zhuo’s heart leapt, and he immediately sensed danger. In the next moment, countless pieces of frost gathered together, creating an unusually intense ice explosion.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
This section of the corridor was directly split open by the massive ice block from within. But in the next moment, brilliant green light shone from the ice block, and a towering tree explosively grew.<br/>
<br/>
The tree’s crown became dense, like a giant umbrella, completely covering that section of the corridor. <br/>
<br/>
Thick, robust vines, like giant pythons, surged out in all directions, battering the white bone skeletons, which were thrown about in smoke and shock. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hid deep within the tree crown, holding onto the trunk, panting heavily. The earlier ambush had left him exhausted, and only now did he catch his breath. Had those bone claws actually struck Ning Zhuo, given his protective methods, the outcome would have been the same as that for the inner wall of the corridor.<br/>
<br/>
“Using three Golden Core-level white bone skeletons to ambush me? Which cultivator in the corridor hated me so much?”<br/>
<br/>
Under the cover of the tree crown, he finally had the opportunity to look out and examine these skeletons in detail. <br/>
<br/>
He saw that their heads were shaped like upside-down triangles resembling those of a mantis, with three spiral ice horns arranged horizontally on their foreheads, and with ice-blue ghostly flames burning in their eye sockets. <br/>
<br/>
They hunched over, with each of their thirty-six spinal segments bearing inverted blades; their limbs were slender, with ice spikes at the joints, and their fingers and toes ended in sharp icy blades. Their chest ribs shimmered with icy light, and occasionally glinted with the shadow of defensive talismans. And their tail vertebrae extended to the ground, forming long bone whips. The bone whips were densely covered with backward-facing barbs; in the earlier ambush, Ning Zhuo had almost been struck by the whips several times.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes relaxed slightly, and connecting with his inner knowledge, he immediately recognized the identity of these assassins -Snow Bone Rakshasa! Identifying them took only a moment.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then immediately saw flashes of fire emerging at the edge of his view. He turned his head and found that the entire Three Generals Camp was engulfed in a sea of fire. <br/>
<br/>
This sea of fire was not normal; the flames were yellow-green in hue and emitted a mournful hissing sound as they burned. This time, Ning Zhuo did not need to consult his inner knowledge; he recognized at a glance the origin of the sea of fire.<br/>
<br/>
Spell -Netherfire Inferno!<br/>
<br/>
He had personally experienced the might of this spell -it was the spell that, back in the Fiery Persimmon Immortal City when he battled Qi Bai, was cast by his opponent. Therefore, with a deep impression, Ning Zhuo immediately recognized it.<br/>
<br/>
“Could it be, these are people from the Soul Devouring Sect?”<br/>
<br/>
“Such a fire, at the very least, is from Nascent Soul-level cultivators.”<br/>
<br/>
“Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s heart suddenly tensed. Since the great battle, the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts, having participated and displayed the Ghost Dao Gate, had immediately been recognized by the armies of Twin Rivers Nation. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo naturally was aware of this military information, and it felt as if a huge stone had been placed upon his heart. “The Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts are among the strongest of the Nascent Soul cultivators, renowned throughout the nations; even if I combined forces with the Three Generals, we would not stand a chance against them!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo himself, with the aid of his mechanical army, could leverage combat power at the Golden Core level. The entire Three Generals Camp, from top to bottom, were striving -capable of fighting against Nascent Soul-level beings. <br/>
<br/>
However, this combat power was specifically between that of Ma Fei Tui and Tu Ming. <br/>
<br/>
And among the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts, the combat power of any one of them was universally acknowledged to be stronger than Tu Ming. Tu Ming, who mastered the divine art of the Ten Thousand Snake Poison Stream, was indeed a True Nascent Soul Lord. Both of the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts were True Lords, and each of them wielded more than one divine technique!<br/>
<br/>
“Be careful, the ones coming are very likely the Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts!” Ning Zhuo urgently communicated this to Liu, Guan, and Zhang. <br/>
<br/>
As soon as he finished, he suddenly looked up and saw a meteorite crashing down from the sky. The white-ice meteorite, accompanied by howling gales, descended heavily. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo channeled his spiritual energy and deployed the wood-element spell “Pine Waves, Jade Waves” to counterattack. <br/>
<br/>
The sound of pine waves suddenly arose, and the jade-green light surged like massive waves, crashing against the white-ice meteorite, yet, like ocean waves hitting a reef, the latter was difficult to shake -its momentum reduced by about thirty percent. Ning Zhuo then hurriedly cast the “Tree World Descent” spell, causing the ground to rise high as countless trees and vines burst forth from the soil. <br/>
<br/>
The towering trees continuously grew taller, forming a protective barrier akin to a city wall.<br/>
<br/>
Wood Technique -Bamboo Joint, Green and Resilient!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then bestowed an additional layer of protection upon the giant trees. <br/>
<br/>
This was a spell that Linghu Jiu had once cast; with his advanced wood-element cultivation, Ning Zhuo, having seen it once, had grasped it. Now it had been completely replicated.<br/>
<br/>

After the annual meeting, when things have stabilized and I have a period of time solely dedicated to writing, I expect to begin making up for the delayed updates in March.”</div>
