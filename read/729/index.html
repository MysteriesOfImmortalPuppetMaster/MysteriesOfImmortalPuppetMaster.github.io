<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The formation Lady Spiderweb was preparing was called the Balanced Yin-Yang Primordial Nurturing Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo had meticulously selected this formation after carefully considering Lady Spiderweb's capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Its primary materials were: Golden Testis Steel Cable and Nethermoon Water Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The former was a metallic cable forged from ten-thousand-year-old Cold Iron and Yang Metal Qi, then refined through countless hammer blows on a mechanical forging platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The latter was a supremely flexible substance originating from the depths of the Nine Nether Sea Eye. Its unique form resembled a slowly flowing, deep blue gel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">After adjusting her state in advance, Lady Spiderweb activated her Innate Demonic Fire, enveloping a coil of Golden Testis Steel Cable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Forging the Golden Testis Steel Cable proved challenging. Lady Spiderweb painstakingly burned the cable for nearly an hour before its surface began to melt slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">However, once the qualitative change occurred, the subsequent burning became easier. The molten area expanded rapidly, and the melting process accelerated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">When the cable had melted to the point where it could barely maintain its shape, Lady Spiderweb immediately began precisely stretching and reshaping it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">As she began reshaping it, her ten fingers danced like phantoms, stretching and molding the steel cable while simultaneously carving intricate formation patterns along its length.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The short golden steel cable, brimming with potent Yang Metal Qi, was as sharp as a needle. With each stroke of her carving, jets of this energy erupted, piercing her fingertips and seeping beneath the skin of her arms, corroding her meridians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Lady Spiderweb's face gradually paled. Her fingers and arms, pierced by the Yang Metal Qi, oozed droplets of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Gritting her teeth, she persevered, forging coil after coil of the massive golden steel cable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Finally, when the process was complete, she straightened her back, let out a low growl, and poured every ounce of her spiritual energy into embedding all the Golden Testis Steel Cables into the walls of the mechanical cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">She collapsed to one knee, her face instantly ashen, sweat pouring down her like rain, and gasped weakly for breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Swallowing a Medicinal Pill, she sat cross-legged to regulate her breathing and restore her condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Lady Spiderweb carefully retrieved a lump of Nethermoon Water Essence. This substance was intensely cold and could not be shaped using conventional methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Lady Spiderweb first spat out her own spider silk, hastily arranging a temporary small array. She then sat cross-legged within the array, her hands forming a gesture as she mentally manipulated the Nethermoon Water Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Her divine sense pierced into the essence, forcibly guiding its flow from within. Step by step, she reshaped it from the inside out, crafting a new form that met her requirements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The extreme yin cold Qi of the Nethermoon Water Essence surged along her divine sense, invading Lady Spiderweb's divine sea like an icy hell. Her soul throbbed with a faint, piercing pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Under her relentless guidance, the essence wove itself into countless Lesser Yin Array Spirit Talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">By the time Lady Spiderweb finished processing the Nethermoon Water Essence, only half a tea time had passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Yet her mental energy had been utterly drained. Her eyes remained tightly shut, tiny droplets of blood seeping from the corners of her mouth. She collapsed to the ground, drenched in sweat, waves of intense dizziness threatening to plunge her into unconsciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Processing the two primary materials was merely the first step in setting up the array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Next, she needed to arrange several clusters of Nethermoon Water Essence throughout the cabin, forming the balanced yin-yang array foundations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">She needed to carve the Two Extremes Spirit Transformation Formation into the Yin-Yang Dual-Colored Stone - the crucial central rune.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">She would lay out Arid Withered Wood in a network of pipes to channel Yang Fire. Yin Frost Stone would also be crafted into slender tubes to carry Yin Harmony Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The greatest challenge lay in activating the formation for the first time. Lady Spiderweb would serve as a human-shaped array foundation, channeling the Yin-Yang Guiding Art. Using her own meridians as bridges, she would forcibly merge the chaotic Yin and Yang Harmony Qi into a preliminary fusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Lady Spiderweb gradually regulated her breathing. Weakened, she sat up, seizing every moment to recuperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Following Ning Zhuo's orders, she had to exert herself fully to complete the Balanced Yin-Yang Primordial Nurturing Formation as quickly as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">What choice did she have? She was already Ning Zhuo's slave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Bound by a powerful slave contract, Lady Spiderweb could only obey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Yet, compared to before, a newfound reverence had taken root in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">She had glimpsed more of Ning Zhuo's true depths: "The place I'm in now must be the Mechanical Magic Treasure - the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"This thing can expand or shrink, rise or fall, transform into a weapon or conceal itself... It traverses the Void as easily as walking on flat ground. It's at least a Nascent Soul-level treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Lady Spiderweb vividly recalled Ban Ji casually mentioning his admiration and longing for the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"So Ning Zhuo possesses such a powerful magic treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"If Ban Ji learns of this, his greed will only intensify, making him even more determined to strike against Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Having collaborated with Ban Ji countless times, Lady Spiderweb knew his nature well. He would stop at nothing to acquire exceptional mechanical creations, resorting to any means necessary to claim them for himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"But how can I leak this secret?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Lady Spiderweb obeyed Ning Zhuo for two reasons: the slave contract and his terrifying Soul Search ability, which filled her with dread and forced her submission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">But she had no intention of remaining enslaved forever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">She quickly devised a plan: incite Ban Ji to attack Ning Zhuo, creating chaos that would give her a chance to regain her freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"I must be cautious and vigilant!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"I've already been deceived once. I can't afford to be careless again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Ning Zhuo's personal strength is indeed remarkable, but he's still just a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator. How could he possibly possess - let alone control - such a powerful treasure?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"His family's influence must be extraordinary, entrusting a Mechanical Dragon to a junior member for protection."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Controlling such a treasure? This is definitely beyond his own capabilities!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"His family's power must be extraordinary to entrust a Mechanical Dragon to a junior member for self-defense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Lady Spiderweb's eyes flashed with sharp insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"If they can bestow even Nascent Soul-level Mechanical Magic Treasures, Ning Zhuo must have a guardian by his side."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Given the Mechanical Dragon's caliber, this guardian is at least a Golden Core-level expert, and likely possesses methods to briefly rival a Nascent Soul cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Having a true Nascent Soul cultivator as a personal protector is exceedingly rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">In the cultivation world, power tends to concentrate on individuals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Once a cultivator reaches the Nascent Soul stage, they become subject to strict oversight. Even Rogue Cultivators, who enjoy greater freedom of movement, remain under constant scrutiny from surrounding forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">For Righteous Path factions, Nascent Soul-level cultivators must communicate in advance, obtain permission, or be formally invited before crossing borders. Otherwise, their actions would be interpreted as espionage, provocation, or even aggression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This unspoken agreement has long shaped the social order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">In Lady Spiderweb's view, Ning Zhuo, as an outstanding junior and his family's hope, undoubtedly possesses hidden trump cards for self-preservation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Within the scope of this trump card, a Nascent Soul-level Mechanical Dragon was normal, but a Nascent Soul-level cultivator was not.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Unless Ning Zhuo had reported his presence to the Myriad Manifestations Sect in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">However, once reported, the Myriad Manifestations Sect, out of respect (and wariness) toward a Nascent Soul cultivator, would inevitably host a banquet and extend formal invitations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">At least, Ban Ji and Lady Spiderweb had detected no such activity or traces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Lady Spiderweb dared not act rashly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"The powerful guardian protecting Ning Zhuo is likely hiding within this Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon as well. He might even be meditating right next to me, watching my every move."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The thought sent a chill down her spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">When setting up her array, she dared not slacken her efforts in the slightest, pouring all her energy into it. This was partly due to Ning Zhuo's control over her, but also a deliberate performance under the watchful eye of this "hidden master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I must be even more cautious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"And I must exert myself fully to distract Ning Zhuo and the hidden master, then patiently await the perfect opportunity..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Unbeknownst to her, a thread invisible to her eyes hung above her head at all times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">One end of the thread was connected to her, while the other stretched straight upward, disappearing into the void, but in reality, it was linked to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Divine Technique: Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo, by nature cautious, had naturally made thorough preparations when bringing Lady Spiderweb into the Mechanical Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Divine Technique he wielded, Life Hanging by a Thread, was his most reliable defense. This technique allowed Ning Zhuo to monitor Lady Spiderweb's condition at any time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">By observing the solidity of the thread, Ning Zhuo could "see" the target's loyalty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Clearly, Lady Spiderweb's loyalty was not high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"But you're putting on quite the act," Ning Zhuo observed from his stone platform. Periodically checking on Lady Spiderweb, he found her diligent and giving her all, which surprised the Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">A thought flashed through Ning Zhuo's mind, and he quickly understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"So, you've chosen to feign submission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">" She is a smart one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo was intimately familiar with the art of feigning submission, having practiced it since the age of two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The competition for the Lava Immortal Palace on Fire Persimmon Mountain, which ultimately made Ning Zhuo the greatest beneficiary, was the culmination of his decades of patient restraint - a truly remarkable achievement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Inside the Demon Subjugation Hall, on the stone platform within the formation, the elderly cultivator nodded slightly, his eyes showing admiration for Ning Zhuo. Stroking his beard, he said, "Second question: The world's sins and merits are deeply intertwined. Cutting off the branches is easy, but severing the roots is difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Worse still, some hide filth and wickedness, using the law's loopholes as shields and the excuse of a 'willing exchange' as justification for their corrupt practices - cultivating depravity and undermining the natural order through illicit trades."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"This practice is insidious and vile, eroding the foundation of one's Dao, yet it is deeply entrenched and far-reaching. If you encounter such a situation, how would you handle it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo's heart stirred, immediately sensing that the second question was simpler and more focused than the first. It was both a reaffirmation of a cultivator's attitude toward evil and a test of their methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"But I cannot show too many 'methods'," he thought, "that wouldn't align with the 'young prodigy' persona I'm presenting externally."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I should focus more on displaying an attitude. That is the correct approach."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo's political acumen far surpassed his apparent age, displaying remarkable maturity. In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, even Zhu Xuanji had been temporarily deceived by it. Deceiving these individuals now was child's play.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After a few moments of contemplation, Ning Zhuo's lips curved into a cold, resolute arc: "Law's loopholes? This thinking is the very soil where filth breeds! Where filth breeds, thunderous judgment must cleanse the earth!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"'Willing  exchange'? That's just a wolf luring a lamb into its trap with poisoned bait! All such schemes are demonic obstacles, deserving of annihilation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Regardless of how deeply rooted or widespread they may be, once discovered, their roots must be severed, their nests burned, and their veins severed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Even if a thousand threads bind them, they must be cut with a single stroke of the sword! Such parasitic evils, if allowed to fester even for a day, will corrupt another soul. They must be eradicated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Where there is no trade, there is no killing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">When the low-ranking cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall heard Ning Zhuo's reply, many raised their eyebrows, sensing the years of honed sharpness and unwavering resolve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The elderly cultivator stroked his beard, mentally assessing: Though his methods lack refinement and his understanding is still shallow, isn't this precisely the spirit of a young man?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Absolutely uncompromising against any sin - what a fine young man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">If everyone in this world thought like him, how could so many nefarious trades lurk in the shadows?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Even if just a majority shared this conviction, the mortal realm would bask in radiant light, and the Righteous Path would flourish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Alas...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The world is steeped in worldly wisdom, yet utterly devoid of youthful vigor and that precious "naivety"!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">In that moment, the elderly cultivator and his companions grew even more fond of the "naive" Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Meanwhile...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">At the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, Yuhe Field:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Yu Heye led Sun Lingtong, descending discreetly from the clouds, and announced, "This is Yuhe Field."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Sun Lingtong surveyed the mountain peak below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Unlike most immortal mountains shrouded in mist and adorned with jagged peaks, Yuhe Field was relatively broad and gently sloped. Its slopes were densely honeycombed with countless Cave Dwellings, carved layer upon layer into the mountainside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The entrances to the Cave Dwellings varied in size,  crude and practical, lacking the serene elegance of typical immortal abodes. Instead, they resembled ordinary hovels. Dried Spirit Beast meat, sun-dried Spirit Grain, and repaired Magic Artifacts and farming tools hung outside the entrances, lending the area a distinctly earthy, lived-in atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Sun Lingtong sighed, "This is one of the largest gathering places for Rogue Cultivators in the sect. I lived here for a time myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"We've arrived at the wrong time. During meal times, the mountain's protective formation activates, illuminating thousands of stoves across the mountain. Countless streams of smoke from cooking Spirit Food rise in unison, and within half an hour, tens of thousands of portions of Spirit Food are prepared."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"This Spirit Food is crucial for us lower-level Rogue Cultivators. Three meals a day provide us with affordable, stable sustenance, replenishing our spiritual energy and aiding our cultivation. It's far more cost-effective than using Spirit Stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Sun Lingtong recalled the intelligence reports and nodded slightly, silently communicating through divine sense: "I know. Protective formation was jointly established by Gan Douding, the head of the Spirit Cuisine Hall, and numerous cultivators from Heavy Formation Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Its primary function is to produce Spirit Food on massive scale at set times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Yu Heye: "That's right... this way,"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He led Sun Lingtong to a marketplace</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Several spontaneous markets had formed on the flatter mountain plateaus and in front of the larger cave dwellings in the Yuhe Wilds. The goods for sale ranged from low-grade Medicinal Pills, Talismans, Spirit Plant seeds, second-hand Magical Artifacts, Culinary Mastery Insights, and even mundane tools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The two of them weaved through the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The sounds of eating and drinking, haggling, and exchanging cultivation insights filled the air, punctuated by the clatter of pots and pans and the cries of Spirit Beasts. Despite the chaos, the atmosphere was vibrant and full of life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">It was a massive "shantytown" built at the foot of the immortal mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Yu Heye walked in front and Sun Lingtong followed, the two moving in silence. They passed through increasingly quiet narrow alleys until they reached a dilapidated house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Yu Heye, familiar with the place, pushed open a rotting wooden gate and stepped into the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The courtyard was desolate and uninhabited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Without heading for the main house, Yu Heye walked directly to the only dry well in the courtyard and jumped in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
