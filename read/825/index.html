<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo relied on brute effort to reach the third curve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Vermilion pillars, carved beams, and blue-gray tiles - the sunlight slanted in from outside the corridor, casting mottled shadows across the floor. Everything looked exactly the same as the first curve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He tried to walk forward, and before long, a fork appeared in the path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">But this time, he could not sense any formation fluctuations at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo did his best to project his divine sense, but its detection range was suppressed even further, limited to only about two zhang around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He cycled through his other methods one by one, yet he failed to gather a single clue to break the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Left with no choice, Ning Zhuo decisively spoke up and requested to withdraw from the trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The cultivators presiding over the formation looked at each other in surprise. They had not expected Ning Zhuo to withdraw of his own accord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"With only this much attainment in the Dao of Formations, he actually dared to challenge our Nine Curves Winding Corridor Formation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"He looks down on us too much!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Heh, so this is a so-called genius? Nothing more than this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The presiding cultivators immediately acted, teleporting Ning Zhuo out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In the next moment, Ning Zhuo found himself back at the entrance of the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">A large crowd of cultivators waiting in line saw Ning Zhuo, and a sudden clamor erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Am I seeing this right? Ning Zhuo was eliminated too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Has it even been that long?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"How strange. Didn’t he just receive a Golden Token? How could such a genius suffer such an embarrassing defeat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"What are you saying? A genius isn't necessarily an all-rounder. Maybe he just came here for fun?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"If he has this much free time, why doesn't he participate in trials he’s more certain of? He could gain opportunities elsewhere. Here, he only earns a loss and damages his own reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Hearing this, some of the cultivators who supported Ning Zhuo fell silent, their gazes toward him now filled with confusion and doubt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo’s expression remained calm. There was no dejection, no annoyance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He turned slightly and walked through the crowd, passing through gazes of mockery and sympathy alike, stepping out of the trial grounds one pace at a time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">From time to time, cultivators were eliminated and teleported out. As time passed, the number of people remaining inside dwindled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Shen Xi was one of the last few to hold out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">By the time he was teleported out, Su Lingkou had already arrived and had been waiting for him for nearly fifteen minutes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Cousin!" Su Lingkou cheered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Shen Xi had been standing with his head bowed, lost in thought after being teleported out. Startled by Su Lingkou’s voice, he looked up and smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Su Lingkou said with a face full of pride, "Cousin, you were one of the last few people to come out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Shen Xi replied, "Unfortunately, I only made it to the sixth curve before the time limit was reached. However, I’ve gained some clues on how to crack that sixth curve."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Su Lingkou took Shen Xi’s arm. "Cousin, let’s go back and think it over carefully."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Mm." After walking a few steps, Shen Xi suddenly thought of Ning Zhuo and asked, "Do you know how Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo performed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Su Lingkou giggled, a hint of disdain appearing on her face. "Cousin, Ning Zhuo really isn't much when it comes to setting up formations. He was eliminated quite early. His score probably wasn't even half of yours."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Oh?" Shen Xi was slightly surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Su Lingkou continued, "If I were him, with such shallow formation attainment, I would never have come here to be humiliated for nothing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Shen Xi said, "That is indeed a bit strange. However, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo cannot be judged by common logic; he likely has his own thoughts on the matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">In Shen Xi’s heart, his evaluation of Ning Zhuo had always been very high. This single failure did not lower his opinion of him in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">As Shen and Su left Soaring Peak in their carriage, a flying letter arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">When they opened it, they saw it was a letter from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"...Fellow Daoist Shen is proficient in the Nine Palaces Formation; today’s trial must have yielded insights. This humble brother wishes to seek guidance. I wonder if Brother Shen has any free time tomorrow..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In the letter, Ning Zhuo first unreservedly described his entire process and feelings during the trial. Then, he sincerely asked Shen Xi for advice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Su Lingkou retracted her divine sense after reading the letter. "I didn’t expect the great Ning Zhuo to fail even the third curve."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"He certainly has thick skin. He’s clearly competing with you for the top spot in the trials, yet he actually dares to ask you for guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Shen Xi smiled slightly, set the letter down, and looked at Su Lingkou. "Cousin, what do you think I should do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Su Lingkou blinked, then realized Shen Xi was testing her. She thought for a moment and said slowly, "Since he took the initiative to ask, you might as well give him some pointers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Shen Xi asked, "Oh? Why should I do that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Su Lingkou gave him a playful look. "Cousin, I’ve thought it through."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Although everyone has three attempts at the Nine Curves Winding Corridor Formation trial, Ning Zhuo couldn't even pass the third curve on his first try, and he couldn't even find any clues. He poses absolutely no threat to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"With his level of formation skill, it's impossible for him to make a sudden leap and pass all nine curves in such a short time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Let alone compete with you for the top spot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Su Lingkou paused before continuing, "Therefore, we might as well use this opportunity to show him goodwill. While Ning Zhuo isn't great at the Dao of Formations, he has his own specialties, and he is the most famous genius at the moment. It can’t be wrong to build a good relationship with him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">A sharp light flashed in Shen Xi’s eyes. "The most famous genius? Cousin, you've reminded me. Perhaps I know one of Ning Zhuo's objectives for this move."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Su Lingkou asked, "Ah? What is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Shen Xi shook his head slightly. "Never mind that. Your reasoning is sound; we shall do as you suggested."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Seeing that Shen Xi had accepted her advice, a look of deep joy appeared on Su Lingkou’s face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">That evening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Shen Xi brought Su Lingkou to the Bluestone Grotto as invited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo personally stood at the entrance to welcome them. "Brother Shen, you are truly honorable! Please, come this way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo led the two into the cultivation chamber and personally poured tea for them. After some small talk, Ning Zhuo took out an item - the very classroom notes Shen Xi had given him before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The notes now contained new content.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Shen Xi swept his divine sense over them and found they were filled with Ning Zhuo’s own interpretations, questions, and even some derivation processes and results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Shen Xi felt quite gratified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Although his main purpose in giving the notes was to befriended Ning Zhuo, seeing his own cultivation insights being so highly valued by another person inevitably made Shen Xi feel a sense of pride, joy, and a faint sense of achievement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo bowed in thanks, saying that he had gained much from reading the notes, but he had many questions he wanted to ask Shen Xi first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Shen Xi had come precisely to resolve Ning Zhuo’s doubts. "I wouldn't dare call it 'guidance.' We are of the same generation; let us simply exchange ideas."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The first question Ning Zhuo asked made Shen Xi’s expression turn serious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo asked, "Each 'palace' of the Nine Palaces Formation is both independent and interconnected. By 'independent,' I mean each palace has its own legal power and logic, forming its own system. By 'interconnected,' I mean the nine palaces can cooperate and support each other through the calculations of the formation heart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"From this, it is clear that the formation heart's calculation is extremely important."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I saw several examples in the notes. Some formation heart calculations are based on fixed principles, while others change in real-time. Which of these two forms is the mainstream today?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Shen Xi replied, "The latter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He then supplemented, "In the past, calculations were done based on certain fixed principles. Therefore, the Nine Palaces Formations of that era still had traces that could be followed. But as cultivation techniques have flourished, the capability of formation heart calculations has grown tremendously. Hundreds of years ago, the cultivation world popularized real-time adaptive formation heart deductions. Thus, modern Nine Palaces Formations are far more varied and difficult to crack than those of the past."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">A light flashed in Ning Zhuo’s eyes. "It is as I suspected. Then, what is the core of these real-time changing formation heart calculations?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Shen Xi took a deep breath and pondered. "There are many things involved. Primarily, it's the formation artifacts, the formation spirits..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He gave a detailed explanation. Ning Zhuo listened very intently, silently committing it all to memory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Time flowed on as Ning Zhuo asked one question after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Shen Xi did his best to answer, choosing his words carefully, falling into deep thought more and more frequently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Brother Shen." Ning Zhuo suddenly interrupted him, the big-headed youth wearing a smile. "You don't need to be so cautious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Shen Xi was slightly stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo looked at him with clear eyes. "I am asking you because I want to learn the real things. The more precise and accurate your descriptions are, the better I can understand. If you're too subtle, it might lead to misunderstandings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Shen Xi was silent for a moment, then laughed. "Alright."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The communication became much smoother after that. Shen Xi no longer had reservations, speaking directly and honestly. Ning Zhuo nodded frequently, occasionally asking counter-questions or inferring other principles from the ones provided.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">By the time Su Lingkou finally couldn't take it anymore and called for a stop, the two were shocked to find that three hours had already passed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"I lost track of time while seeking guidance from Brother Shen," Ning Zhuo lamented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Shen Xi regained his senses and was also secretly shocked. He had thoroughly enjoyed the three-hour exchange. This was extremely rare in his experience of debating the Dao with others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He analyzed the reasons in his heart: "Firstly, Ning Zhuo is truly humble and sincere. He has no burden regarding his reputation. For someone as young and successful as him, this is rare and precious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Secondly, his comprehension is truly startling. Many principles I thought would require repeated explanation to understand, Ning Zhuo often grasped instantly. In some cases, before I even had a chance to speak, Ning Zhuo had already deduced the conclusion himself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This made Shen Xi’s guidance yield immediate results, bringing a thick and continuous sense of achievement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Brother Shen." Ning Zhuo stood up and bowed solemnly. "I have benefited immensely today. Thank you for your guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Shen Xi hastily returned the bow. "Fellow Daoist Ning, you are too polite. Today’s exchange has allowed me to witness your brilliance. Your comprehension is far beyond ordinary people. As long as you are willing to invest the time and energy into the Nine Palaces Formation, you will certainly achieve something."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">At this point, he took a storage bag from his robe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"These are the classics I use for my daily study of the Nine Palaces Formation, twenty-three volumes in total. If you have time, you might want to browse through them. Although I can't guarantee you'll pass the Nine Curves Winding Corridor Formation in this Flying Cloud Assembly, it will at least give you a deeper accumulation in the field of Nine Palaces Formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned, then reached out with both hands to accept the storage bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He took a step back and cupped his fists. "In that case, my deepest thanks to Brother Shen!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">On the way back, Su Lingkou remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Shen Xi noticed his cousin's unusual behavior and asked with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Su Lingkou looked up, her expression complex. "Cousin, that Ning Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">She paused, choosing her words. "His comprehension is a bit terrifying. It’s almost... almost not inferior to yours."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Shen Xi nodded. "Indeed. I didn't expect his understanding of the Nine Palaces Formation to improve so quickly either."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Su Lingkou sighed. "Every question he asked was sharp and critical. If it were me, I might not have been able to ask those questions in a whole day. But him? In three hours, he asked no less than thirty questions, and every single one hit the mark. I barely understood some of them, and then his next question would skip over a huge chunk in the middle to ask about the subsequent difficulties! If I didn't also cultivate the Nine Palaces Formation and have some understanding of it, my speed of thought wouldn't have been able to keep up with his at all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Cousin, I'm a bit worried now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Shen Xi tucked away his smile and looked quietly at Su Lingkou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Su Lingkou’s gaze flickered as she looked ahead. "Cousin, there’s no need to teach him everything. Why not stop while you're ahead?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Shen Xi was silent for a moment before shaking his head slightly. "Cousin, there's no need for that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"But Ning Zhuo is your competitor! Aren't we just creating an enemy for ourselves?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Shen Xi shook his head again. "I only ask one question - if Ning Zhuo didn't seek guidance from me, could he still progress in the Dao of Formations?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Su Lingkou fell silent, then sighed. "Of course he could. This is the headquarters of the Myriad Manifestations Sect; what kind of classics are not available here? Ning Zhuo has already made a name for himself and is even famous throughout the sect. If he truly wanted to join a certain faction, what kind of master could he not find?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Shen Xi said, "Precisely. Using this opportunity to make Ning Zhuo owe us a favor is the most cost-effective investment. Given his comprehension, his formidable learning ability, and his admirable humility, as long as he is willing to spend the time and energy, he will definitely make a name for himself in formations. By then, the help I give him now will surely depreciate greatly or even become meaningless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Sigh." Su Lingkou gave a long sigh. "You’re right, Cousin. Since Ning Zhuo's momentum cannot be stopped, it’s better to help him with all our might and form a good bond!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="215"/>
<paragraph index="217">Bluestone Grotto.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">He did not rush to flip through the formation classics Shen Xi had given him. Instead, he reviewed the exchange they just had, constantly chewing on the details and digesting them once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"The saying of 'Technique, Land, Companion, Resources' is extremely logical. Just a few hours of consulting Shen Xi, and if I enter the formation again, I will surely be able to pass the third curve!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Now I can be certain that my previous thought was correct - by constantly cracking the Nine Curves Winding Corridor Formation and improving my skills, it will be of great help in cracking the Luoshu Water Formation next!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The night grew deep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo began to read through Shen Xi’s classics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">At the same time, inside the Shuyu Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Sun Lingtong took a deep breath and began to use the Inheritance Jade Page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">A large amount of true intent related to the Dao of Formations was extracted from Sun Lingtong's small body, converging into strands of light that flowed into the Inheritance Jade Page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">As time passed, Sun Lingtong’s body began to tremble slightly, and fine beads of sweat broke out on his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
