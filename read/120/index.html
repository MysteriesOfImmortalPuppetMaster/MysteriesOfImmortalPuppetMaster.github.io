<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Thirdly, the current City Lord of Fire Persimmon City, Meng Kui, possesses a divine ability known as the Mountain Watching Technique, which is quite formidable." "Among the four great generals of the Meng Family, Meng Kui is the only strategist. He has managed Fire Persimmon Immortal City for many years, ensuring smooth governance and order." "You possess Golden Core cultivation, Heavenly Golden Eyes, and have magical treasures from the national treasury for protection, making your combat prowess outstanding." "However, once Meng Kui uses the Mountain Watching Technique, it will create a fate energy field, causing the fate energy of all living beings within to fluctuate drastically." "There are very few treasures that can suppress fate energy. Without such a treasure, you will find it difficult to suppress your own fate energy and will be affected." "I shall bestow upon you a Wind Chime as a warning device." "This humble servant thanks Your Majesty for the grace." Zhu Xuanji once again knelt on one knee.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the Southern Bean King waved his hand: "The relevant intelligence and secrets of the Lava Immortal Palace are recorded in the royal secret realm. Before you set out, go and take a look; it will help you complete this task. Remember, all secrets must not be leaked." "This humble servant obeys!" Zhu Xuanji accepted the order and withdrew.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji departed from the capital city.<br/>
<br/>
Alone, he concealed his identity and traveled a long distance until he reached Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Family," Zhu Xuanji's expression was solemn.<br/>
<br/>
In the Southern Bean Kingdom, the Su Family and the Meng Family were equally renowned and powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji stealthily made his way to the mountain top but was discovered.<br/>
<br/>
He used his Heavenly Golden Eyes to gaze at the Lava Immortal Palace from afar; it was his first time seeing it with his own eyes.<br/>
<br/>
He brought Chi Han and visited the Zheng Family, obtaining intelligence related to the Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
He delved into the Crimson Flame Demon Lava Cave and used the Tracing Back to the Source Technique to discover that the Fire Spirit and the Mechanized Fire Monkey were the true culprits behind the explosion at the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
However, his investigation was obstructed.<br/>
<br/>
Whether it was the Mechanized Fire Monkey or the Fire Spirit, both clues were deliberately designed by someone and held little value.<br/>
<br/>
During the Fire Persimmon Festival, Zhu Xuanji monitored the entire event but did not find any trace of the Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's performance evoked his sympathy, while Yuan Er left him disappointed and disgusted.<br/>
<br/>
From the fragments of the Mechanized Fire Monkeys, he collected numerous clues once again.<br/>
<br/>
He decisively abandoned them, concluding that they were decoys meant to distract him and waste his time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
He speculated that the Shadow Demon Cultivator might have allied with a certain power within the city.<br/>
<br/>
The other party had long been prepared against the Tracing Back to the Source Technique, hiding deeply and proving to be a formidable opponent.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji decided to put in hard work.<br/>
<br/>
He requested all records from the Four Major Powers and compiled a list of suspects.<br/>
<br/>
He deliberately made the list public, hoping to flush out the hidden enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji acted ostentatiously, first investigating Li Leifeng.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, he was schemed against.<br/>
<br/>
Li Leifeng died of old age, and Zhu Xuanji secretly verified that it was true.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, he devoted all his time to investigating within Fire Persimmon Immortal City, reviewing the past performance records of officials and clerks but found no suitable candidates.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote a memorial to the royal family, stating the facts and hoping that the Zhu Family would send a member to take on the role of the headmaster.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji continued his investigation.<br/>
<br/>
When he encountered resistance from demonic cultivators, he killed Zhao Die.<br/>
<br/>
He also killed Liu Ying, confirming that the latter did not possess the Life Thread Divine Ability.<br/>
<br/>
He acted high-profile, causing a series of reactions.<br/>
<br/>
The demonic cultivators and rogue cultivators in Fire Persimmon Immortal City either left, formed groups, or sought refuge.<br/>
<br/>
This did not deter Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
The investigation continued to progress step by step.<br/>
<br/>
During this period, the Qi Refining talents of the Four Major Powers were attacked and assassinated simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji immediately took action to investigate.<br/>
<br/>
He uncovered many clues, but the key points were all severed.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the clues still pointed to Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji felt effective but did not act rashly.<br/>
<br/>
He was quite disappointed, realizing that this was not the true culprit he was looking for but rather a covert confrontation among the Four Major Powers.<br/>
<br/>
The three great families wanted to use him as a tool to deal with the City Lord's Mansion, thereby benefiting themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji understood and withdrew in time.<br/>
<br/>
The day before, he went to the Zhou Family to inquire about Chu Xiyao.<br/>
<br/>
During the interrogation, the Zhou Family specifically sent an elder to accompany and support Chu Xiyao.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji did not find Chu Xiyao lying and left the Zhou Family expressionlessly.<br/>
<br/>
"Interesting." He looked up at the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Despite causing a commotion and disturbing many people, he did not flush out the true culprit.<br/>
<br/>
"The mastermind is hiding very deeply."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji looked at the suspect list again.<br/>
<br/>
His list was divided into three sections.<br/>
<br/>
The first section included confirmed cultivators who had entered the Lava Immortal Palace, such as two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng Family, a Golden Core Patriarch from the Zhou Family, Li Leifeng, Zhao Die, Liu Ying, Chu Xiyao, and others.<br/>
<br/>
The second section included cultivators with considerable expertise in Mechanism Techniques, meeting the criteria for entering the palace, but with no records of entering or leaving the palace from the Four Major Powers.<br/>
<br/>
Among them was Chui Can Ke!<br/>
<br/>
The third section included those with expertise in Mechanism Techniques who had entered the palace or had no related records but were publicly recognized as deceased.<br/>
<br/>
He had already investigated the first section, and it was now the turn of the second section.<br/>
<br/>
After investigating two people, it was Chui Rong Ke's turn.<br/>
<br/>
Chui Rong Ke was very mysterious but had sold many mechanical constructs in the black market multiple times.<br/>
<br/>
The last time he appeared, he had teamed up with Han Ming to raid the Purple Sun Courtyard, cooperating with a mysterious third person to successfully steal a large number of elixirs.<br/>
<br/>
Strangely, these elixirs appeared in the Fire Persimmon Forest and then mysteriously disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji had long known about this clue, but after some consideration, he felt that Chui Rong Ke had little to do with the Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lie had tampered with the elixirs to guard against Han Ming.<br/>
<br/>
Chui Rong Ke and his group likely saw through the trick and deemed the elixirs unusable, so they abandoned them.<br/>
<br/>
Having wasted their efforts, they might have thrown the elixirs into the Fire Persimmon Forest out of revenge or to shift the blame.<br/>
<br/>
If the City Lord's Mansion and the Shadow Demon Cultivator fought, the Fire Persimmon Forest would suffer, and the City Lord's Mansion would incur heavy losses.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, these rogue cultivators would watch from the sidelines, gloating.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the handling of the Fire Persimmon Forest, Zhu Xuanji acknowledged Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si, in his governance, truly protected the immense wealth of the Fire Persimmon Forest.<br/>
<br/>
This was for the City Lord's Mansion and the Southern Bean Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's logic for suspecting Chui Rong Ke's connection with the Shadow Demon Cultivator was straightforward and clear‚Äîif Chui Rong Ke and his group were truly involved with the Shadow Demon Cultivator, why not secretly deliver the elixirs? Why make such a big fuss and let everyone know?<br/>
<br/>
Now, Zhu Xuanji's investigation still pointed to Chui Rong Ke.<br/>
<br/>
"The black market leader is Sun Lingtong, at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage, an outer disciple of the Void Sect. He must know something." With this thought, Zhu Xuanji sought him out.<br/>
<br/>
"Chui Rong Ke, huh." Sun Lingtong's big eyes rolled as he grinned cheekily, "Lord Zhu, what do you want with him?" Zhu Xuanji's face was expressionless: "You only need to cooperate and tell me the details. What I want with him is none of your concern." Sun Lingtong scratched his head: "Oh dear, in front of Lord Zhu, I can't lie."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly: "Sun Lingtong, I've investigated you. Although you are the black market leader, you are not a heinous villain. Over the years, you have reorganized the black market and adhered to the rules you set, which, to some extent, has prevented much bloodshed and conflict."<br/>
<br/>
"Just tell the truth, and I won't make things difficult for you."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong spread his hands: "Then I'll say it. I know Chui Rong Ke's whereabouts. But if you want to know, you need this." Saying this, Sun Lingtong extended his tender fingers and rubbed them in front of Zhu Xuanji's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
"You want money? Hahaha." Zhu Xuanji laughed in anger, "In all my years of handling cases, I've never paid for information. You are really pushing your luck, daring to ask for money." "Hmm?" Suddenly, a golden light flashed in Zhu Xuanji's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
His expression changed: "No, you're lying!" "Even if I paid, you wouldn't reveal the truth." This time, it was Sun Lingtong's turn to change his expression.<br/>
<br/>
"Interesting." Zhu Xuanji stared at Sun Lingtong, his eyes glowing with golden light, "You are protecting Chui Rong Ke so much. It seems you were also involved in the Purple Sun Courtyard case?" Sun Lingtong shouted: "Lord Zhu, what are you talking about?" "You're framing me!"<br/>
<br/>
"I'm just a child, and you're an adult. You're wronging me and bullying me?!" "Someone, come and see, Lord Zhu is bullying people!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sat on the ground, pounding his chest and crying loudly: "Too much bullying! No kindness at all, the royal family members bullying a child!!" "Wuwuwu!"<br/>
<br/>
"I can't live anymore, I can't live anymore."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm being wronged, framed by the Zhu Family. A dignified Divine Constable, making baseless accusations without evidence!" "How can I live after this?"<br/>
<br/>
"My reputation!"<br/>
<br/>
"What will others think of me, oh heavens."<br/>
<br/>
"I might as well die, wuwuwu, I'm so pitiful." "Quick, record this scene with a Jade Slip. I'll keep it for future grievances." "Come and see, the Zhu Family royal members are bullying commoners!!!" Sun Lingtong cried and rolled on the ground, his tender legs and arms flailing.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji:<br/>
<br/>
The small vendor who was just kicked to the ground by Sun Lingtong: ...<br/>
<br/>
However, the burly men brought by Sun Lingtong remained silent, as if used to it.<br/>
<br/>
One of them even took out a Jade Slip and started recording the scene.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji laughed out loud in anger: "Do you think throwing a tantrum will make me stop my investigation?" "Sun Lingtong, stand up, don't make me look down on you."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong cried: "No, I won't. Come and see, someone is bullying a child." He cried while crawling towards Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji instinctively took a few steps back but was still grabbed by Sun Lingtong's leg.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was furious, shaking his leg and shouting: "Sun Lingtong! You are the leader of the black market, a prominent figure. Now you are acting like a three-year-old child?" Sun Lingtong: "I don't care, you are bullying me. If you have evidence, show it." "Wuwuwu, my sect's elders are not here, and you are bullying the weak. Are you even human?!" This commotion attracted many onlookers.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's face turned blue as he frantically shook his leg.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong clung tightly, refusing to let go, like a sticky plaster.<br/>
<br/>
He even rubbed his face against Zhu Xuanji's pants, smearing snot and tears on them.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji: "Sun Lingtong, you are going too far!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shouted: "Kill me, Lord Zhu, just kill a child. You are the great Lord Zhu who investigates and protects the people. How could you be wrong?!" Zhu Xuanji was so angry that he felt a murderous intent.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, a bell rang in his Divine Sea Upper Dantian.<br/>
<br/>
It was the Wind Chime!</div>
