<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
In the small courtyard, wisps of Yin Qi rose and enveloped the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
The sounds outside the courtyard grew increasingly faint, as if isolating this place from the world.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, with his short stature resembling a three-year-old child, had a head of shiny black hair, large eyes with clear black and white, chubby cheeks, and tender, smooth skin.<br/>
<br/>
He was trapped in the middle of the courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
In front of and behind him stood two black-clad Demon Cultivators, one with triangular eyes and the other with a hook nose.<br/>
<br/>
To Sun Lingtong's right, a shadow, as if alive, clung to one side of the courtyard wall.<br/>
<br/>
Within the shadow, Han Ming's figure was faintly visible.<br/>
<br/>
Her delicate face was tinged with a greenish-gray hue, and her expression, twisted with resentment and hatred, made her appear particularly sinister.<br/>
<br/>
"The situation is unfavorable," Sun Lingtong thought to himself.<br/>
<br/>
He could clearly feel the isolation from his surroundings, as if a once clear world had suddenly been obscured by a layer of rough glass.<br/>
<br/>
With this sensation, Sun Lingtong realized he had fallen into a Magic Formation.<br/>
<br/>
The lack of visible signs of the formation was only because the opponents were holding back.<br/>
<br/>
"Three against one, and all at the Foundation Establishment Stage," Sun Lingtong observed the two black-clad Demon Cultivators and Han Ming in the corner.<br/>
<br/>
His gaze lingered on Han Ming for a moment. "Han Ming possesses Yin Corpse Qi! Most of her body has already turned into a Deficient Corpse, making ordinary attacks ineffective against her." Sun Lingtong calculated in his mind, while outwardly appearing anxious. "Wait, everyone, don't be rash! I am a disciple of the Void Sect. You must consider the consequences of your actions."<br/>
<br/>
"If I die at your hands, there will be a mark left behind. The Void Sect's future retaliation is something you should think carefully about." The two black-clad Demon Cultivators remained expressionless, while Han Ming gritted her teeth. "Worried about the Void Sect's retaliation? You schemed against me before; weren't you afraid of the Soul Devouring Sect's revenge?" Sun Lingtong quickly replied, "I didn't scheme against you; it wasn't my intention. It was Chui Can Ke who offered a high price, making it irresistible!"<br/>
<br/>
"The black smoke that knocked you out wasn't from me. It was Chui Rong Ke. He imprisoned and humiliated you. You should go after him!" "We are not enemies. I was just doing a job for money. If you pay me, I'll be your ally."<br/>
<br/>
"Ally?!" Han Ming's voice rose, full of mockery and disdain. "Do you think I'll fall for the same trick twice? And you want money? Ha, can't you see the situation you're in?" "Forget it. Killing you and extracting your soul for interrogation will be the same!" "Attack."<br/>
<br/>
"Wait!" Sun Lingtong shouted. "I know you've set up a formation, but you need to understand. This is Fire Persimmon Immortal City! Your formation will surely trigger a reaction from the Immortal City Grand Formation. How long can you maintain it?" "I'm trapped in the formation and can't escape. I'll definitely fight you to the death. Wouldn't that old fox Chui Can Ke laugh himself to death?"<br/>
<br/>
"Let's sit down and talk. There's no need for a life-and-death struggle." Sun Lingtong tried to persuade them.<br/>
<br/>
On any other day, his words might have had some effect.<br/>
<br/>
But now, after Meng Kui had used the Mountain Watching Technique, the Fate Energy Field had already influenced everyone present.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming shouted, "He's stalling for time. Attack!" As she spoke, she formed hand seals, opened her mouth, and spat out a gust of black-gray Yin Wind.<br/>
<br/>
Hand seals, body seals, heart seals.<br/>
<br/>
These were the primary methods of auxiliary spellcasting in the Cultivation Realm.<br/>
<br/>
The two black-clad Demon Cultivators also cast the same spell, blowing out two more gusts of Yin Wind.<br/>
<br/>
The Yin Wind, seemingly slow but actually fast, approached Sun Lingtong from three directions, about to encircle him.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong channeled his Spiritual Power, and his figure suddenly vanished from the spot, reappearing by the left side of the courtyard wall.<br/>
<br/>
The Yin Wind missed its target, converging into a whirlwind that continued to pursue Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
This was the advantage of being from the same sect.<br/>
<br/>
All three of them practiced the Soul Devouring Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Although each person's Spiritual Power had its unique characteristics, their essence was similar.<br/>
<br/>
This allowed their spells to temporarily merge rather than clash violently.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong tried to leap over the courtyard wall, but suddenly, Yin Qi howled before his eyes, and the ground cracked open, releasing a torrent of Yin Wind.<br/>
<br/>
The Yin Wind surged, forming a wall five to six feet thick and two zhang high.<br/>
<br/>
The Yin Wind walls were not just in one place.<br/>
<br/>
In the next breath, the courtyard walls were all blown away, replaced by the fierce black-gray Yin Wind.<br/>
<br/>
"In my Yin Wind Narrow Barrel Formation, where do you think you can run, Sun Lingtong?" The hook-nosed Demon Cultivator laughed triumphantly.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong found no way forward, and the Yin Wind whirlwind was closing in from behind.<br/>
<br/>
He cursed, stretched out his left hand, and formed a hand seal with his fingers, creating a handprint.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, he spread his left hand, and a ball of lightning formed in his palm.<br/>
<br/>
Heart Lightning! Boom.<br/>
<br/>
With a loud explosion, the lightning shattered the Yin Wind.<br/>
<br/>
But the triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator's Fine Needle Magical Tool took advantage of the chaos, silently stabbing towards the back of Sun Lingtong's head.<br/>
<br/>
If it pierced through, Sun Lingtong would be severely injured if not dead.<br/>
<br/>
In this critical moment, Sun Lingtong's eyes flashed with spiritual light.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly turned around, his gaze locking onto the Fine Needle Magical Tool.<br/>
<br/>
He had just used his left hand to cast a Thunder Technique and couldn't use it again, so he reached into his robe with his right hand and flung out a handkerchief.<br/>
<br/>
The handkerchief flew out, wrapping around the Fine Needle Magical Tool.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong giggled, leaped lightly, and grabbed the handkerchief with his right hand, securing the Fine Needle Magical Tool.<br/>
<br/>
The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator's expression changed instantly.<br/>
<br/>
He frantically channeled his Spiritual Power, consuming his Divine Thought, trying to summon the Fine Needle Magical Tool back.<br/>
<br/>
But once the handkerchief wrapped around it, his connection with the Fine Needle Magical Tool weakened significantly.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Sun Lingtong grabbed it, the Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator could barely sense the Fine Needle.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui's heart sank as he recognized it: "Void Sect, Entrapment Technique!"<br/>
<br/>
The Fine Needle struggled violently within the handkerchief, and just as Sun Lingtong was about to succeed, Han Ming lunged forward.<br/>
<br/>
"Let go!" Han Ming's movements were stiff but incredibly fast, her fingers spread wide, reaching for Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Her fingernails were exceptionally sharp, black-purple in color, leaving ten sharp trails in the air, with a sickly sweet scent wafting through.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's hair stood on end, and he quickly let go, abandoning the Fine Needle and the handkerchief, retreating rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
The Fine Needle and the handkerchief fell to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming was inherently ruthless, having sought revenge against Sun Lie in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Sun Lingtong had tricked her, and she harbored deep hatred for this disciple of the Void Sect, aiming every move at Sun Lingtong's vital points.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong retreated repeatedly, not daring to confront her sharp claws.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming, relying on her superior Talent, had also cultivated the Immortal Zombie Transformation Technique, making her a formidable body cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong practiced the Void Sect's techniques, having achieved Foundation Establishment, primarily cultivating the Divine Sea.<br/>
<br/>
His Middle Dantian Qi Sea and Lower Dantian Essence Sea couldn't compare to his Upper Dantian.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming continued to press forward, fully utilizing the capabilities of her zombie body, displaying ruthless and venomous attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong dodged left and right, his movements extremely agile.<br/>
<br/>
Despite his treasures being far inferior to Han Ming's, he managed to maintain the situation.<br/>
<br/>
The two black-clad Demon Cultivators from the Soul Devouring Sect, observing from the side, gradually noticed the pattern.<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Lingtong's combat experience is incredibly rich!"<br/>
<br/>
"Han Ming has a significant advantage, but she lacks proficiency in martial techniques. Despite her advantage, she can't establish dominance quickly."<br/>
<br/>
"Help her!"<br/>
<br/>
The two communicated through voice transmission and reached a consensus.<br/>
<br/>
The Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator activated the Yin Wind Narrow Barrel Formation, causing the walls of Yin Wind to press inward.<br/>
<br/>
The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator recalled the Fine Needle Magical Tool, taking Sun Lingtong's handkerchief Magical Tool in return, and once again channeled his Divine Thought.<br/>
<br/>
The Fine Needle flew out, circling around to coordinate with Han Ming, and thrust at Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, besieged by the three, struggled to defend himself.<br/>
<br/>
He was first struck several times by the Fine Needle, nearly collapsing his Body Protection Spell.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he was scratched by Han Ming's nails, and quickly swallowed a Pill to counteract the poison.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, as the walls of Yin Wind pressed in, Sun Lingtong managed to cast his spell successfully.<br/>
<br/>
Void Traversal Technique.<br/>
<br/>
He took a large step back, causing spatial ripples to form, enveloping him from behind.<br/>
<br/>
After retreating, he vanished into thin air.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he reappeared behind Han Ming and the others, standing at the other end of the Yin Wind Narrow Barrel Formation, finally gaining some distance.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's expression was extremely grave.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming turned around and sneered, "Sun Lingtong, since we already know you are from the Void Sect, how could we not guard against the Void Traversal Technique?" Sun Lingtong's childlike face twisted into a ferocious expression for the first time, "Fine, fine, if you push me this far, even if I lose my life, I'll drag you all down with me!" Han Ming retorted, "Wishful thinking!"<br/>
<br/>
She channeled her spiritual power, forming hand seals with both hands, and spat out a stream of ghostly green fire.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong let out a sharp cry and pulled out a gourd from his bosom, from which a jet of icy water sprayed forth.<br/>
<br/>
The ghost fire and icy water collided, creating a thick mist that filled the air.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes glowed with spiritual light, easily piercing through the mist.<br/>
<br/>
He abandoned Han Ming and charged towards the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
The Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator was the one maintaining the Magic Formation.<br/>
<br/>
Killing him was Sun Lingtong's only chance to break the spell and escape the predicament.<br/>
<br/>
However, the three from the Soul Devouring Sect had long anticipated this move.<br/>
<br/>
The Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator retreated, disappearing into the Yin Wind.<br/>
<br/>
The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator and Han Ming immediately pursued, engaging in a chaotic battle with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong abandoned his previous evasive fighting style, recklessly expending his Spiritual Power and Divine Essence, frequently casting spells and throwing various Magical Tools.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the battle between the two sides was evenly matched.<br/>
<br/>
"This Sun Lingtong has quite a few tricks up his sleeve!" The Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator exclaimed after destroying one of his Magical Tools with the Magic Formation.<br/>
<br/>
"People from the Void Sect are all thieves. Sun Lingtong has been accumulating these Magical Tools in the Black Market for years; they must all be stolen." The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator remarked.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming interjected, "Kill Sun Lingtong quickly! You can chat all you want after the battle!" The Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator snorted, "Han Ming, what kind of attitude is that? We saved you."<br/>
<br/>
The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator added, "Without us, you'd still be bound in chains. This is your enemy; we've already helped you enough." The Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator and the Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator both held back.<br/>
<br/>
As Sun Lingtong fought fiercely, the two black-clad Demon Cultivators grew wary.<br/>
<br/>
They preferred to let Han Ming take the lead, weakening Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
If he used any trump cards on Han Ming, it would make the two black-clad cultivators safer.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators of the Wide Path were more adept at and preferred solo combat.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest characteristic of Demonic Techniques was that they could use fellow cultivators as resources for cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
This gave Demonic Sect disciples a strong motive to turn against each other.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment of joint assault on Sun Lingtong, internal strife broke out among the three from the Soul Devouring Sect.<br/>
<br/>
The pressure on Sun Lingtong significantly decreased, giving him a chance to catch his breath.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes flashed with brilliance, and he reverted to a defensive strategy, focusing on evasion and occasionally casting spells or using Magical Tools to attack Han Ming or the walls of Yin Qi.<br/>
<br/>
Prolonged defense leads to mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming spat ghost fire, chilling Sun Lingtong to the bone, and her black hair turned to white ash.<br/>
<br/>
Her nails were exceptionally sharp and carried corpse poison.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's body was covered in numerous wounds, the flesh around them rotting and emitting a foul corpse stench.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming's Soul Capturing Shuttle was what Sun Lingtong feared the most.<br/>
<br/>
She would rather endure other attacks than let the Soul Capturing Shuttle get close.<br/>
<br/>
"Hehehe, hahaha!"<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Lingtong, did you ever think about today when you framed me back then?"<br/>
<br/>
"I will capture and kill you, extract your soul, and let you taste the Soul Punishment of our Soul Devouring Sect."<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming's eyes were bloodshot, and the thrill of revenge filled her with an almost maddening excitement.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was cornered.<br/>
<br/>
"Die!" Han Ming screamed, pushing her Spiritual Power to the limit.<br/>
<br/>
The ghost fire surged, forming a Dark Fire Python that opened its mouth to swallow Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
At the brink of life and death, Sun Lingtong suddenly let out a sly laugh.<br/>
<br/>
"Want me to die?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hehehe, you three are far from it!" In the next moment, he vanished.<br/>
<br/>
"Void Traversal Technique again," the Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator muttered.<br/>
<br/>
"No matter, he's in my Yin Wind Narrow Barrel Formation... not good!" The Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator's expression suddenly changed.<br/>
<br/>
The fierce Yin Wind blew continuously, forming a wind wall that collapsed at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
The Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator, who had been maintaining the formation, suffered a terrifying backlash from the sudden change.<br/>
<br/>
He spat out a mouthful of blood and collapsed, unconscious.<br/>
<br/>
"What happened?!" The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator exclaimed in shock as Sun Lingtong appeared behind him.<br/>
<br/>
Swoosh.<br/>
<br/>
A gleaming dagger pierced through the Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator's lower back with ease.<br/>
<br/>
The dagger then unleashed an azure electric current, violently attacking the Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator's internal organs.<br/>
<br/>
The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator convulsed violently, as if having a seizure.<br/>
<br/>
In just a few blinks of an eye, his eyes rolled back, and he opened his mouth, releasing a puff of black smoke.<br/>
<br/>
Thud.<br/>
<br/>
He too collapsed, unconscious.<br/>
<br/>
"Only you are left." Sun Lingtong, no longer in a sorry state, his eyes shining brightly, his fighting spirit soaring.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming was furious, "Without those two burdens, it's no big deal!"<br/>
<br/>
With that, she charged at Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong took a deep breath, holding a dagger in each hand, continuously infusing them with Spiritual Power.<br/>
<br/>
The daggers' blades flickered, resembling butterflies flapping their wings, dancing outwards.<br/>
<br/>
The butterfly-like blade light was dazzling and exquisite, with no trace of Spiritual Power, completely restrained.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's self-created blade technique—Butterfly Wing Blade!<br/>
<br/>
The butterfly swarm surrounded Han Ming.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming, enveloped in Yin Wind, spat ghost fire, using her fists and feet to attack with all her might, but all her attacks missed!<br/>
<br/>
The butterfly blade light was incredibly agile, some lightly grazing her skin, others piercing through her limbs and emerging from her back.<br/>
<br/>
From formation to attack to dispersal, the butterfly swarm took no more than five breaths.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming stood still, unmoving.<br/>
<br/>
Her eyes widened, her face full of disbelief!<br/>
<br/>
"This, this is your true strength?" she struggled to speak.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as she finished speaking, her head fell off, her torso was cut in half diagonally, and the upper part also fell to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
As she fell, her limbs were severed and scattered on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Blood spurted out, quickly forming a pool of blood around Han Ming's corpse.</div>
