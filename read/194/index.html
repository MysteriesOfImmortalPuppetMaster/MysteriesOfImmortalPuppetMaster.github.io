<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Zhu Xuanji led three Golden Core Stage cultivators deep into the volcano.<br/>
<br/>
The group entered the volcano openly and without concealment.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, in his capacity as a royal envoy, ordered Meng Kui to guard the Immortal City diligently, allowing no mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
The three Golden Core cultivators were in high spirits.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, they were suppressed by Meng Kui, but now seeing him being overshadowed, they couldn't help but feel a bit elated.<br/>
<br/>
Unless Meng Kui rebelled and became a traitor to the Southern Bean Kingdom, he had to guard the Immortal City and the mountaintop, quietly waiting for Zhu Xuanji and the others to return.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was unaware of Zhu Xuanji's group's actions.<br/>
<br/>
On that day, he began the first round of assembly.<br/>
<br/>
He combined a large number of mechanical parts, assembling them into a massive black iron skeleton.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, the Tree Martial Ape was eight feet tall, taller than Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Blood Battle Ape was shorter than Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The newly forged mechanical ape was entirely a large-scale construct.<br/>
<br/>
Its skeleton alone was one and a half zhang tall, equivalent to a two-story building.<br/>
<br/>
From the skeleton, one could feel its hardness and stubbornness, like an ancient beast.<br/>
<br/>
The ape's skeleton and joints were made of Ten Thousand Strikes Black Iron.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued to assemble the mechanical ape's chest and back.<br/>
<br/>
This part mainly used Red Sun Steel, which was very thick and extremely heavy.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then installed the ape's claws and teeth.<br/>
<br/>
These were made of Diamond Stone, sharp in texture, enhancing the mechanical ape's attack power.<br/>
<br/>
On the important joints, the surface of the skeleton, and the inner side of the chest and back of the ape, intricate grooves were engraved.<br/>
<br/>
These grooves intertwined, forming an extremely complex formation diagram.<br/>
<br/>
Upon closer inspection, one would find that the formation diagram was incomprehensible because at least three formations were superimposed on each other.<br/>
<br/>
This was a remarkable array arrangement technique.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family was known for their expertise in formations, as evidenced here!<br/>
<br/>
In many of the grooves, thick blood silkworm threads were embedded.<br/>
<br/>
These blood silkworm threads would be melted by Ning Zhuo's mana and added to the formation grooves, serving to maintain and preserve the formations.<br/>
<br/>
This could extend the lifespan of a formation by at least thirty percent.<br/>
<br/>
The first round of assembly of the entire mechanical ape was completed in secret collaboration between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Its thighs and lower body were still just a skeleton, but the entire mechanical ape already weighed over thirty thousand jin.<br/>
<br/>
According to Ning Zhuo's conservative estimate, the fully assembled ape would weigh around forty thousand jin.<br/>
<br/>
Such weight would cause slight depressions on ordinary ground.<br/>
<br/>
This heavy body posed a greater challenge for power.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Ning Zhuo used the Mechanical Heart Furnace - Fire Essence rewarded by the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
This mechanism resembled a giant sphere, with a forge at its center.<br/>
<br/>
The surface of the sphere was dotted with various cylindrical protrusions of different sizes, lengths, and thicknesses.<br/>
<br/>
The Fire Essence, once filled, would be consumed and converted into powerful energy, causing the cylindrical protrusions to extend and retract, providing strong power in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
Because it consumed Fire Essence, the middle layer of the sphere used an internal carving technique to cleverly arrange a powerful storage formation.<br/>
<br/>
The Mechanical Heart Furnace alone was not enough; Ning Zhuo also used Wind Fire Wheels.<br/>
<br/>
According to his design, two giant Wind Fire Wheels would be installed on the calves of the new mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
When necessary, the Wind Fire Wheels would spin at full force, creating fierce winds and flames, propelling the heavy mechanical ape forward violently!<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical ape's palms would be very broad.<br/>
<br/>
This time, the martial arts talismans filled in the palms and wrists were not just a dozen, but thirty-six in total.<br/>
<br/>
As for the design of the martial arts talismans and Wind Fire Wheels, why did they resemble those of the mechanical apes in the Lava Immortal Palace?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had already prepared his explanation: "What? Am I not allowed to borrow excellent design ideas?"<br/>
<br/>
As for the crafting of the martial arts talismans, Ning Zhuo entrusted it to his subordinates.<br/>
<br/>
These former stewards were Foundation Establishment elites, and crafting some martial arts talismans was no problem for them.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Ning Zhuo prepared a stack of each type of martial arts talisman.<br/>
<br/>
His main strategy was to be fully prepared for battle, never fearing overuse.<br/>
<br/>
The most important part was the internal structure of the mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
A high-quality blood transformation pool from the Lava Immortal Palace would be installed in the ape's lungs.<br/>
<br/>
The blood oil bottle, also a reward, would be connected to the blood transformation pool, hanging in the lower dantian area of the abdomen.<br/>
<br/>
In the abdomen, there was also a blood spring pot next to the blood oil bottle.<br/>
<br/>
The blood spring pot contained Ning Zhuo's blood, which could automatically purify the blood in the blood oil bottle using it as a guide.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's blood was the standard, and the purified essence blood could be fully absorbed by Ning Zhuo, perfectly meeting his needs.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo would need to use pills to heal and quickly replenish his blood when he lost blood.<br/>
<br/>
But healing was better than purifying essence blood himself!<br/>
<br/>
During the healing process, Ning Zhuo could fully engage in other cultivation activities, making the most of his time.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and his group continued to delve deeper into Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they used the tunnels within the mountain, and sometimes they had to blaze their own trail.<br/>
<br/>
With many people, they could take turns acting as the vanguard, bearing the brunt of the pressure, fighting at the forefront, and constantly opening up the path.<br/>
<br/>
There were many Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts inside Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Even though many had perished in the previous riot due to the fate energy field, attacking the Lava Immortal Palace, the number of beasts remaining in the mountain was still uncountable.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji wielded a treasured ruler, sweeping through all obstacles.<br/>
<br/>
The Zheng family cultivators harnessed earth fire, launching fierce attacks.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family cultivators threw formation disks, setting up the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch exhaled frost, freezing and killing powerful enemies.<br/>
<br/>
The six Golden Core cultivators supported each other, gradually coordinating better, though they had to rest several times along the way, gradually becoming exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
The deeper they went, the stronger and more numerous the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts became, constantly assaulting them, leaving them no time to rest.<br/>
<br/>
"We've arrived!" Zhu Xuanji shouted, boosting morale.<br/>
<br/>
They finally reached the underground lair of the Fire Melting Demon Ape King.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji immediately noticed the remnants of the mechanical demon general.<br/>
<br/>
However, in the next moment, the Demon Ape King rose and roared.<br/>
<br/>
With the roar, the bodies of demon apes emerged from the fire, surrounding Zhu Xuanji and the others heavily.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it!"<br/>
<br/>
"They have five Golden Core Stage demon apes?"<br/>
<br/>
"The enemy is too strong, should we retreat?"<br/>
<br/>
The physical prowess of the demon apes far exceeded that of humans.<br/>
<br/>
Unless one was a body cultivator, it was extremely difficult to compete with them physically.<br/>
<br/>
None of Zhu Xuanji's group were body cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Even the Zheng family Golden Core cultivator, Zheng Shuangjun, only practiced a body cultivation technique as a secondary discipline.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji also wanted to retreat, but the demon ape formation was too thick, ultimately blocking their escape.<br/>
<br/>
A life-and-death battle ensued!<br/>
<br/>
Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Underground secret base.<br/>
<br/>
In the dense dark clouds, Luo Shang was surrounded by several seductive ghostly women.<br/>
<br/>
These ghostly women were extremely skilled at arousing desire and absorbing male yang energy.<br/>
<br/>
However, Luo Shang remained calm and cold-faced among the many enchanting and alluring ghostly women, quietly cultivating his demonic techniques!<br/>
<br/>
He was using the ghostly women to aid his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he opened his eyes slightly, sensing a faint fluctuation.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, this fluctuation expanded, and the space seemed to open like a door.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong walked in.<br/>
<br/>
He had to change locations periodically, moving to the next underground secret base.<br/>
<br/>
This time, it was here.</div>
