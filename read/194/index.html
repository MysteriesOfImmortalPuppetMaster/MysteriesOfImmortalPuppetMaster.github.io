<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji led three Golden Core Stage cultivators deep into the volcano.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The group entered the volcano openly and without concealment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zhu Xuanji, in his capacity as a royal envoy, ordered Meng Kui to guard the Immortal City diligently, allowing no mistakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The three Golden Core cultivators were in high spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Usually, they were suppressed by Meng Kui, but now seeing him being overshadowed, they couldn't help but feel a bit elated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Unless Meng Kui rebelled and became a traitor to the Southern Bean Kingdom, he had to guard the Immortal City and the mountaintop, quietly waiting for Zhu Xuanji and the others to return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo was unaware of Zhu Xuanji's group's actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">On that day, he began the first round of assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He combined a large number of mechanical parts, assembling them into a massive black iron skeleton.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Previously, the Tree Martial Ape was eight feet tall, taller than Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Golden Blood Battle Ape was shorter than Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The newly forged mechanical ape was entirely a large-scale construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Its skeleton alone was one and a half zhang tall, equivalent to a two-story building.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">From the skeleton, one could feel its hardness and stubbornness, like an ancient beast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The ape's skeleton and joints were made of Ten Thousand Strikes Black Iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo continued to assemble the mechanical ape's chest and back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">This part mainly used Red Sun Steel, which was very thick and extremely heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo then installed the ape's claws and teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">These were made of Diamond Stone, sharp in texture, enhancing the mechanical ape's attack power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">On the important joints, the surface of the skeleton, and the inner side of the chest and back of the ape, intricate grooves were engraved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">These grooves intertwined, forming an extremely complex formation diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Upon closer inspection, one would find that the formation diagram was incomprehensible because at least three formations were superimposed on each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This was a remarkable array arrangement technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Zhou family was known for their expertise in formations, as evidenced here!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">In many of the grooves, thick blood silkworm threads were embedded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">These blood silkworm threads would be melted by Ning Zhuo's mana and added to the formation grooves, serving to maintain and preserve the formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">This could extend the lifespan of a formation by at least thirty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The first round of assembly of the entire mechanical ape was completed in secret collaboration between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Its thighs and lower body were still just a skeleton, but the entire mechanical ape already weighed over thirty thousand jin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">According to Ning Zhuo's conservative estimate, the fully assembled ape would weigh around forty thousand jin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Such weight would cause slight depressions on ordinary ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This heavy body posed a greater challenge for power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Therefore, Ning Zhuo used the Mechanical Heart Furnace - Fire Essence rewarded by the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">This mechanism resembled a giant sphere, with a forge at its center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The surface of the sphere was dotted with various cylindrical protrusions of different sizes, lengths, and thicknesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Fire Essence, once filled, would be consumed and converted into powerful energy, causing the cylindrical protrusions to extend and retract, providing strong power in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Because it consumed Fire Essence, the middle layer of the sphere used an internal carving technique to cleverly arrange a powerful storage formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Mechanical Heart Furnace alone was not enough; Ning Zhuo also used Wind Fire Wheels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">According to his design, two giant Wind Fire Wheels would be installed on the calves of the new mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">When necessary, the Wind Fire Wheels would spin at full force, creating fierce winds and flames, propelling the heavy mechanical ape forward violently!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The mechanical ape's palms would be very broad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">This time, the martial arts talismans filled in the palms and wrists were not just a dozen, but thirty-six in total.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">As for the design of the martial arts talismans and Wind Fire Wheels, why did they resemble those of the mechanical apes in the Lava Immortal Palace?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo had already prepared his explanation: "What? Am I not allowed to borrow excellent design ideas?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">As for the crafting of the martial arts talismans, Ning Zhuo entrusted it to his subordinates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">These former stewards were Foundation Establishment elites, and crafting some martial arts talismans was no problem for them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Therefore, Ning Zhuo prepared a stack of each type of martial arts talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">His main strategy was to be fully prepared for battle, never fearing overuse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The most important part was the internal structure of the mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">A high-quality blood transformation pool from the Lava Immortal Palace would be installed in the ape's lungs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The blood oil bottle, also a reward, would be connected to the blood transformation pool, hanging in the lower dantian area of the abdomen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In the abdomen, there was also a blood spring pot next to the blood oil bottle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The blood spring pot contained Ning Zhuo's blood, which could automatically purify the blood in the blood oil bottle using it as a guide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo's blood was the standard, and the purified essence blood could be fully absorbed by Ning Zhuo, perfectly meeting his needs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo would need to use pills to heal and quickly replenish his blood when he lost blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But healing was better than purifying essence blood himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">During the healing process, Ning Zhuo could fully engage in other cultivation activities, making the most of his time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zhu Xuanji and his group continued to delve deeper into Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sometimes they used the tunnels within the mountain, and sometimes they had to blaze their own trail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">With many people, they could take turns acting as the vanguard, bearing the brunt of the pressure, fighting at the forefront, and constantly opening up the path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">There were many Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts inside Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Even though many had perished in the previous riot due to the fate energy field, attacking the Lava Immortal Palace, the number of beasts remaining in the mountain was still uncountable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zhu Xuanji wielded a treasured ruler, sweeping through all obstacles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Zheng family cultivators harnessed earth fire, launching fierce attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Zhou family cultivators threw formation disks, setting up the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Ning family patriarch exhaled frost, freezing and killing powerful enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The six Golden Core cultivators supported each other, gradually coordinating better, though they had to rest several times along the way, gradually becoming exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The deeper they went, the stronger and more numerous the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts became, constantly assaulting them, leaving them no time to rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"We've arrived!" Zhu Xuanji shouted, boosting morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">They finally reached the underground lair of the Fire Melting Demon Ape King.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zhu Xuanji immediately noticed the remnants of the mechanical demon general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">However, in the next moment, the Demon Ape King rose and roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">With the roar, the bodies of demon apes emerged from the fire, surrounding Zhu Xuanji and the others heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"They have five Golden Core Stage demon apes?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"The enemy is too strong, should we retreat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The physical prowess of the demon apes far exceeded that of humans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Unless one was a body cultivator, it was extremely difficult to compete with them physically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">None of Zhu Xuanji's group were body cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Even the Zheng family Golden Core cultivator, Zheng Shuangjun, only practiced a body cultivation technique as a secondary discipline.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zhu Xuanji also wanted to retreat, but the demon ape formation was too thick, ultimately blocking their escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">A life-and-death battle ensued!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Underground secret base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In the dense dark clouds, Luo Shang was surrounded by several seductive ghostly women.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">These ghostly women were extremely skilled at arousing desire and absorbing male yang energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">However, Luo Shang remained calm and cold-faced among the many enchanting and alluring ghostly women, quietly cultivating his demonic techniques!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He was using the ghostly women to aid his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Suddenly, he opened his eyes slightly, sensing a faint fluctuation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Immediately, this fluctuation expanded, and the space seemed to open like a door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong walked in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He had to change locations periodically, moving to the next underground secret base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This time, it was here.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
