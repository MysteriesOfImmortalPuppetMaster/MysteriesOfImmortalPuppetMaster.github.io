<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Wave after wave of the Ghost Tide crashed against the city walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The defense force, built around the City Guard and bolstered by countless cultivators from the surrounding area, held their ground behind the fortifications.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Countless ghosts were shattered into wisps of nothingness every moment, while many cultivators fell in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Tie Guzheng, commander of the City Guard, watched the battlefield with a grim expression, issuing orders to adjust the city's defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Only three Reserve Army units remain," Tie Guzheng thought heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Earlier, the White Paper City Lord had offered generous rewards to brave warriors, mobilizing nearly all available forces from the surrounding area to reinforce the defenses. This desperate measure had allowed the city to hold out for so long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">But after enduring repeated Ghost Tide assaults, the city's defenses had been severely depleted, and manpower was once again stretched thin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Report! The western gate is under critical assault! Large numbers of Soul-Hooking Geckos have scaled the walls and seized a section of the ramparts!" An urgent military report arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Tie Guzheng's brow furrowed deeper. He quickly assessed the situation and realized that none of the three Reserve Army units were adequately equipped to handle the threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Besides taking matters into my own hands, our only hope lies with the Qing-Jiao Army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Qing-Jiao Army was a force led by Qing Chi and Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo), funded and staffed by the Ghostman Clan's Qing Clan and the Human Clan's Jiao Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Strictly speaking, Qing Chi had yet to fully establish the army; it was still in its formative stages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"We've received our orders! To the West Gate!" Inside the city, Qing Chi opened her eyes and sprang to her feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">She had been impatiently awaiting the order to strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The other cultivators, long prepared for battle, moved swiftly to follow her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Qing Chi burst out of the temporary barracks, charging toward the West Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">A large group of cultivators surged after her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Finally, they're moving..." Ning Zhuo watched from afar, hidden in the shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Their marching discipline isn't as polished as the Three Generals Camp or the Red Flower Camp - they haven't had time for formal training. But in this city, with its narrow alleys and winding streets, there's no room for large-scale formations anyway."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Still, this weakness must be addressed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"After all, the battlefields of the Underworld won't be this complex."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">A section of the city wall near the west gate was now devoid of cultivators, occupied instead by dozens of Soul-Hooking Geckos clustered together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Simultaneously, a massive swarm of geckos continued to scale the wall, surging toward the parapet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The walls of White Paper Immortal City were not easily climbed. Layer upon layer of wallpaper, each sheet a Talisman Paper, burned continuously. Many ghosts screamed in agony upon contact, the weaker ones reduced to ash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The stronger Soul-Hooking Geckos endured the burning Talisman Paper, clinging to the wall with lingering sparks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The geckos flicked their tongues, licking each other's bodies to extinguish the remaining embers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">They were rapidly recovering!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The commander witnessing this scene, his eyes bloodshot, knew they couldn't afford to let this continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"If this goes on, this section of the wall will fall! If we lose it, the west gate will be in danger. Then we'll be the ones responsible for the city's downfall!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"One more time! Everyone, charge with me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The commander's voice was hoarse from shouting. Despite his injuries, he led the charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">His courage and sense of duty ignited the cultivators' spirits. They followed him in a desperate counterattack, determined to reclaim the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Soul-Hooking Geckos turned their heads almost simultaneously and spat out their coiled tongues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The geckos' tongues shot out with astonishing speed, their length equally astonishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">In the blink of an eye, these tongues pierced through numerous cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The cultivators had no time to react as they fell one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Some managed to withstand the onslaught with their defensive measures, but most were struck. As the tongues retracted, they yanked the cultivators' souls from their bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The geckos' tongues retracted even faster than they had extended!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The cultivators' souls were reeled into the geckos' mouths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The geckos snapped their jaws shut and swallowed them whole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The soulless bodies collapsed to the ground. In this single assault, at least half the cultivators had perished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The cultivators' morale shattered, their resolve crumbling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The leader roared, "Keep charging!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But only a handful followed him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The rest scattered, fleeing in terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo observed this scene from the shadows, unsurprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The leader and the few who still charged with him were all City Guard members. Though not formal cultivators, they were well-trained, loyal, and willing to fight, hailing from respectable families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The others, however, were mostly villagers from the towns surrounding the Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">These villagers, lacking deep attachment to the Immortal City and having never experienced such brutal combat or undergone rigorous training, possessed unstable morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">If not for the White Paper Immortal City's formidable defenses, these cultivators would have long since crumbled under the Ghost Tide, slaughtered into complete disarray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The geckos opened their mouths again, launching a second volley of tongues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The leader and several cultivators instantly fell, their eyes wide with bitter resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Their souls were hooked and dragged into the geckos' bellies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Qing-Jiao Army, having just arrived, witnessed this gruesome scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Something's wrong. These Soul-Hooking Geckos are far stronger than normal. What's going on?" Qing Yan frowned deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He was about to halt and observe cautiously when Qing Chi, standing before him, roared with fury, "You vile beasts! Charge with me and avenge our comrades!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Having been nurtured by the Military Seed program, their first military system was "Absolute Obedience to Orders". This made the fledgling army more inclined to follow their commander's commands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Thus, upon hearing Qing Chi's rallying cry, they swarmed onto the city wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"I..." Qing Yan stared in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo, observing the battle from afar, exclaimed, "Qing Chi made the right choice!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Having experienced countless battles himself, he had instinctively recognized this fleeting opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Sure enough, as the main force charged forward, only a few scattered Soul-Hooking Geckos reopened their mouths and shot out their tongues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">These tongues moved with blinding speed. Even though the cultivators were prepared, they couldn't react in time and had to rely on their own defenses to withstand the attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The tongues struck their targets, but the soldiers merely staggered before continuing their advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The cultivators who had just been routed stared in disbelief. "What's happening? Their defenses are no better than ours!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">If they hadn't known that these Soul-Hooking Geckos were purely ghostly beings, inherently filled with hatred and murderous intent toward living beings from the Yang Realm, the observing cultivators might have suspected the geckos were holding back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he suddenly understood. "It's their constitution!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"These soldiers have been nurtured by the Military Seed. Their bodies and souls have been tempered toward becoming Paper Money Spirit Envoys, their foundations strengthened through multiple cycles of enhancement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The military logistics were costly, but every penny was worth it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The enhancement to the soldiers' foundation provided by the Military Seed was immense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">While their defensive techniques were only of average quality, their own foundation was far more robust than ordinary, rendering the Soul-Hooking Geckos' attacks almost completely ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Hmm?!" Seeing this, the enemy general, who had been hiding in a corner, could no longer remain still and revealed himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Wandering Dao Field!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He unleashed his full power, activating his Dao Field to immediately deepen his influence over the battlefield on the city wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">A hazy gray full moon materialized above the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Silver-gray threads, resembling jellyfish tentacles, floated in the air around the city wall, swaying gently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The cultivators within the Dao Field felt their souls becoming light and ethereal, as if about to detach from their bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Their instincts proved correct. Some of the cultivators who had previously retreated in disarray lost control, their souls flying out of their bodies in terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Qing Yan's eyes flashed with intense light. "The Wandering Ghost God!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">This was a renowned deity from the Underworld, with a history stretching back to ancient times. Its form was that of a gray full moon, surrounded by countless mica-like tentacles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">These silver-gray wandering threads, resembling mica tendrils, could easily extract souls. Ordinary methods proved largely ineffective against them, making them exceedingly troublesome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">However, within the White Paper Immortal City's walls, the city's defenses significantly suppressed the Wandering Dao Field's power, reducing its effectiveness to less than forty percent of its full potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"So that's it!" Ning Zhuo realized. "The Wandering Ghost General has been hiding here, launching covert attacks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo immediately recognized the enemy commander's identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">After Sun Lingtong obtained Luo Si's approval, he had returned to the Yang Realm. Several days prior, he had concealed himself within the Underworld Army's encampment, accompanied by a small squad of ox cavalry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">His presence made gathering military intelligence both convenient and reliable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Wandering Ghost General, a devotee of the Wandering Ghost God, wielded the Wandering Dao Field. This field weakened the connection between souls and bodies within its boundaries, making separation easier. Furthermore, souls detached from their bodies moved far faster than usual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">It was precisely through his covert interference, influencing the battlefield, that the defending forces had fallen into the enemy's trap, leaving them helpless against the Soul-Hooking Geckos' assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The enhanced Dao Field immediately affected Qing Chi and the others. As they ran, many found their souls surging beyond their thighs and arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Qing Chi shouted, "Paper Armor Technique!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The cultivators obeyed instantly, each casting the Paper Armor Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Within moments, layers of talisman paper enveloped their bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The protective effect of the Paper Armor was immediate. It restrained their souls while simultaneously repelling the Soul-Hooking Gecko's subsequent tongue strikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Wandering Ghost General frowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The Paper Armor Technique itself wasn't rare, but the skill these cultivators displayed was remarkable. Truly advanced practitioners could mold the talisman paper into full-fledged armor, offering far greater protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Yet their version was rudimentary - mere sheets of talisman paper clinging to their bodies, visibly thin and fragile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">What astonished the Wandering Ghost General was the talisman paper's effectiveness in combat. It completely isolated them from the Dao Field's influence and even had enough residual power to block the gecko's tongue attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">This defied all logic!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Unless the Paper Armor Technique was particularly well-suited to these cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Cultivators' physical constitutions varied greatly, leading to significant differences in their affinity for certain spells. The same spell could manifest with vastly different power depending on the caster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"But it's impossible for all these cultivators to be so compatible with the Paper Armor Technique! Unless..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The Wandering Ghost General's heart sank. He hastily retrieved a Ghost Fan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">With rapid strokes, the Ghost Fan conjured a torrent of Yin wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The wind surged with overwhelming force, sweeping across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"What a massive Yin wind!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Retreat! This wind will kill us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The routed cultivators, their composure shattered, paled and scrambled backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Qing Chi and her forces, caught in the Yin wind's onslaught, found their momentum halted. As their formations threatened to crumble and morale wavered, Qing Chi roared, "Yin Crossing Technique!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">As the owner of the Military Seed and First General, she had naturally mastered both techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Even those who hadn't learned the Yin Crossing Technique through the Military Seed had trained together to master it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The Yin Crossing Technique enveloped the cultivators, instantly transforming the raging Yin wind into a gentle breeze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Of course, this was merely the Qing-Jiao Army's perception. To outsiders, it appeared as though they had swiftly adapted to the yin wind, charging onward through the gale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Soul-Hooking Geckos, bloated from their feast, found their combat prowess severely diminished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">At this critical moment, Qing Chi led her newly formed army to the battlefield, arriving just in time to launch a devastating assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Their initial charge was like a scythe through wheat, instantly slaughtering the majority of the geckos. The cultivators then fought fiercely, mercilessly butchering the remaining creatures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">As the section of the city wall was about to be reclaimed by White Paper Immortal City, the Wandering Ghost General could no longer restrain himself and swooped down from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Perfect timing!" Qing Chi's eyes blazed with fierce light as azure flames erupted around her. With a thunderous stomp, she surged toward the Wandering Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Their fists and feet clashed in mid-air, unleashing thunderous booms that shook the entire battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Wandering Ghost General retreated slightly and activated his Ghost Fan. Qing Chi countered by unleashing azure flames, sending forth blooming fist-flowers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">After three rounds of combat, neither gained the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Seeing that the cultivators had already retaken the wall and were effortlessly slaughtering the Soul-Hooking Geckos attempting to climb it, the Wandering Ghost General realized the tide had turned and began to withdraw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Sensing his retreat, Qing Chi immediately gave chase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The Wandering Ghost General sneered, "You can't stop me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">His natural speed was astonishing, and he was confident he could retreat from the front lines. But before fleeing, he needed to dispel his Wandering Dao Field, which he had personally created.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">However, just as he began to do so, the plaque above the western gate of White Paper Immortal City suddenly erupted with an otherworldly light, seizing control of the Dao Field.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Simultaneously, countless sheets of wallpaper flew from the city walls, each one a talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The talismans swarmed like a swarm of bees, encircling the Wandering Ghost General completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Forced to fight defensively, the Wandering Ghost General unleashed a barrage of ghostly arts, intercepting the talisman assault with impressive ferocity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Die!" Qing Chi seized the opportunity. Having finished her preparations, she ignited her entire body with Azure Flame and crashed into the Wandering Ghost General like a blazing meteor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The Wandering Ghost General chose to block the impact head-on. But the moment they collided, his expression twisted in horror, consumed by infinite regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The Azure Flame meteor shattered his chest, tearing through his body and exiting from his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">As death approached, the Wandering Ghost General twisted his head, glaring at Qing Chi. "You! This is military power enhancement!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Though the new army was still in its infancy, it could already provide such enhancements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Empowered by the military formation, Qing Chi's combat prowess soared, surpassing even that of the Wandering Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"I refuse to accept this!" the Wandering Ghost General roared before disintegrating into ash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Caught completely off guard by Qing Chi's sneak attack, he failed to utilize his speed advantage and died a humiliating death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Only a Ghost Path Golden Core remained, hovering in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Qing Chi, however, was too weak to retrieve it. She plummeted from the sky, the Azure Flame around her body rapidly dissipating as she collapsed into unconsciousness from exhaustion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Qing Yan swiftly caught his daughter and assumed command of the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The cultivators momentarily panicked before regaining their composure. They held their ground within the city walls, slaughtering the surrounding ghosts until they scattered in disarray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"It's truly a cultivator army!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"White Paper Immortal City's foundation is solid. They decisively revealed a trump card."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"But why is a Ghost Clan girl leading the army?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The Qing-Jiao Army not only immediately reclaimed the city walls but also executed a Golden Core-level Ghost General, achieving the greatest victory in White Paper Immortal City's defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">In a single battle, the Qing-Jiao Army, already the talk of White Paper Immortal City, became renowned throughout the entire Yin Tide Black Marsh Wetlands!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
