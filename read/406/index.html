<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 406: Ning Zhuo's Terrifying Talent</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">After obtaining the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, Ning Zhuo's desire to leave grew stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This was his biggest goal since coming to Wanyao Valley, which he had finally achieved by luck. Ning Zhuo couldn't wait to ride the Ten Thousand Li Dragon and fly far away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Staying at Myriad Medicine Sect would no longer help much in treating Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Previously in the Linglong Mirror Wall, Ning Zhuo had already consulted with Fairy Jingyu and others, bringing out Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin and requesting the ancient sages to treat her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Many doctors, dan masters, and mechanism cultivators shook their heads, expressing their inability to help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Although the Linglong Mirror Wall was nearly a celestial artifact, it still had its limits. When it came to external paths, it was beyond its capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The earliest Blood Remnant Dynasty, representing the paths of demons and monsters, could be adapted to and absorbed by the Linglong Mirror Wall. But for the later Forbidden Dynasty, the wall couldn't yet adapt to the Buddhist and divine paths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Not to mention the ghostly and strange principles of the Night Rain Dynasty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">And Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's dao injury was closely related to the Night Rain Dynasty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">However, many artifact refinement masters were attracted, staring intently at the Buddhist doctor with gleaming eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"This mechanism contains spirituality, it's truly a spiritual treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Today's cultivators can create spirituality, the younger generation is impressive!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"So, we've all grown old, become ancient. We must trust in the wisdom of future generations!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Originally, Ning Zhuo had hoped the Three Sect Superiors would leave their images in the Linglong Mirror Wall. But the inquiry results left him disappointed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Even if the Linglong Mirror Wall wasn't self-sealed in the earth's core, it remained in a hidden state. Only those with destiny could touch it and leave their images.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Obviously, although The Master of the Tree Sects was powerful, he had no destiny with the Linglong Mirror Wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong, as an observer, noticed Ning Zhuo's unusual mood and directly reminded him: "Ning Zhuo, stay steady!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"You've achieved such a high goal as the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, you should be grateful and comforted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Don't be too impatient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Haste makes waste, you still have many important loose ends to tie up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Calm down!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Under Sun Lingtong's rebuke, Ning Zhuo forcibly endured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He knew Sun Lingtong was right - he indeed had many important matters left unfinished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">At Original Mountain, in the Maoshu Tower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo sat at the highest level, with tea and pastries laid out before him, being treated very well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">However, he had no mind for food and drink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He slowly opened a scroll.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Enlightenment Diagram - Golden Dragon Breaking Through Clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The vast plains stretched endlessly. The sky was covered in dense clouds, like heavy curtains hanging from heaven. A dazzling light broke through the sky, transforming into a giant dragon emerging from the sea of clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The dragon's body was covered in golden scales, each scale flashing with metallic light, as if forged from divine weapons. It tumbled through the air, stirring up gusts of wind, tearing apart the cloud layers, revealing golden lightning, displaying a divine appearance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"The metal-element spell Golden Dragon Breaking Formation..." Ning Zhuo only needed to look two or three times before immediately comprehending the spell contained within this enlightenment diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He only needed continuous practice to master it thoroughly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"This Golden Dragon Breaking Formation spell still has many areas that can be improved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo carefully pondered for a moment and immediately discovered that this spell still had quite a few flaws that could be completely improved, enhancing its power while reducing spiritual energy consumption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">His current level in the Five Elements realm was at least at the master level. Looking at these enlightenment diagrams, he could not only perceive the spells and comprehend the paintings in just a few breaths but could also detect flaws and imperfections.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"What is my true level in the Five Elements realm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Even Ning Zhuo wasn't quite sure about this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">After all, back then, with the boost from his celestial talent and Spirit Concealment Willow, by the final stage, he was completely dazed and couldn't distinguish clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">As for what his celestial talent was, he had also asked the Five Elements Divine Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Five Elements Divine Lord told him: After helping to boost his realm earlier, he had sought out many dharma bodies from the reflection wall to calculate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">These dharma bodies had one thing in common - they were all skilled in divination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The calculation results showed that the Five Elements Divine Lord not taking Ning Zhuo as a disciple was an absolutely correct decision. Another correct matter concerned Ning Zhuo's celestial talent. The later this talent was revealed, the more beneficial it would be for Ning Zhuo. The earlier it was revealed, the more it would bring disaster, making Ning Zhuo unable to bear it and triggering a life-or-death crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Five Elements Divine Lord specially warned Ning Zhuo: "Regarding your celestial talent, you must let nature take its course, absolutely must not actively seek it out, don't conduct tests. When the time is right, this answer will automatically come to you. This would be best for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Many things in this world aren't better known earlier. Sometimes, not knowing is actually most beneficial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo, though disappointed, chose to believe the Five Elements Divine Lord's judgment and temporarily stopped exploring his own celestial talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">This wasn't difficult for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Because in his heart, the most urgent and important matter was still finding a way to cure his mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ha ha ha!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Lin Jingshan's senior brother Lao De stepped heavily on the wooden stairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He brought a batch of enlightenment diagrams, feeling indignant in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"How has Master become confused? Actually letting me bring so many enlightenment diagrams for that thief Ning Zhuo to view."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"It must be little junior sister who spoke many good words for Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The key is that when reporting to big senior brother, he actually was happy to see it happen! Ah, big senior brother is too kind, and too noble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Regarding the matters of the Linglong Mirror Wall, according to the alliance agreement, all involved parties had to maintain secrecy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Lao De and others' talents and abilities were insufficient, so they were kept in the dark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Lao De walked to the top floor of the library tower and saw how well Ning Zhuo was being treated, his expression darkened further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He thought to himself: "In the past, only Master and big senior brother have sat in this position. Now it's being occupied by an outsider like Ning Zhuo, how preposterous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Constrained by his sect's rules, Lao De couldn't act out, so he could only put on a cold face and place the enlightenment diagrams on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows: "Why are there only these few? Didn't your Master ask you to gather all the Five Elements-related enlightenment diagrams from the entire sect to show me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Lao De thought, it would take you at least several years to comprehend these, what's the rush?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">But verbally he explained that knowing Ning Zhuo was anxious, he decided to first deliver the portion that had been gathered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo nodded, even without using Life Thread Silk, he could roughly understand Lao De's mood and thoughts just by observing his expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Wait a moment, I'll return these to you after I finish looking at them," Ning Zhuo stopped Lao De who wanted to withdraw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He opened a newly delivered enlightenment diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">At the top of a high mountain, a cultivator wearing a red robe raised both hands to the sky, as if guiding the sun's power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">In the sky, the scorching sun hung high, sunlight poured down like flames, and the world was filled with intense heat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The cultivator was surrounded by raging fire, light flames distorted the air, ignited the mountain's vegetation, triggering raging flames that burned everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Fire element spell - Blazing Sun World Burn!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo's heart trembled: "What a fierce and domineering spell."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He put down the enlightenment diagram, stretched out his hand, his five fingers forming seals, and after a dozen breaths, a flame emerged from his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">This flame somewhat resembled the one in the diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Seeing this, Lao De was shocked to his core and involuntarily asked: "This! Ning Zhuo, have you previously learned this spell?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He absolutely couldn't believe that Ning Zhuo could comprehend the spell from the enlightenment diagram after just a few glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This was truly inconceivable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Lao De couldn't even imagine it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">However, Ning Zhuo glanced at him and immediately rebuked: "Silence!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"I let you stay here to be like a wooden post, not to speak and disturb my comprehension."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Lao De could only close his mouth, his expression becoming increasingly indignant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo looked at the flame in his hand and secretly sighed: "The Blazing Sun World Burn spell needs true sun fire to truly display its power. Without this fire seed, even though my realm is profound, I'm only imitating. Even at full power, I can't reach fifty percent of the spell's true power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He continued comprehending.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The next diagram was quite unique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">In an ancient valley. The ground split open, molten rock surged out, clear springs flowed down from the walls, the two met at the valley bottom, steam rising together. Within the steam, fire dragons and water dragons appeared, intertwining and encircling each other, creating a magnificent sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"This is a spell containing both fire and water elements - Water Fire Fusion!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Interesting, interesting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo looked a few times, put down the enlightenment diagram, one hand producing fire, one hand producing water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The flames and water flow merged together, achieving harmony and coexistence within their turbulent opposition!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Seeing this, Lao De couldn't help but bulge his eyes, becoming suspicious again, though this time he kept his mouth shut.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Subsequently, enlightenment diagram after enlightenment diagram was comprehended by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Having seen enough, Lao De gradually realized the truth, his mouth slowly opening wide, eyes bulging, like an ant being stepped on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Ning Zhuo, this kid's comprehension ability, has actually reached such a level!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Unbelievable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"No wonder Master, little junior sister, and big senior brother treat him so differently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Terrifying, such comprehension ability is terrifying!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">After realizing this, the confusion and resentment in Lao De's heart disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He immediately imagined that this was his sect, his Master, little junior sister, and big senior brother seeing potential in Ning Zhuo's future, showing goodwill at his budding stage to build good karma!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo finished comprehending all these enlightenment diagrams and let Lao De take them back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"When will you bring me the next batch of enlightenment diagrams?" Ning Zhuo asked coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Lao De bowed repeatedly: "I'll gather them as quickly as possible, definitely can have them ready by tonight, please wait a bit, Young Master Ning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Then go quickly and return quickly." Ning Zhuo's eyes opened slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">He didn't give Lao De any pleasant expression, yet precisely this attitude made Lao De more respectful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Lao De hurriedly withdrew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Only then did Ning Zhuo put away his casual expression and smile slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This time he took the opportunity to make an impression, which would definitely be effective. Not only did he remove the misgivings in the hearts of Lao De and others, but he also cleared some obstacles for the future entry of the Ning family members into Myriad Medicine Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">According to the alliance agreement, both the royal Zhu family and the Fire Persimmon  Ning clan would send some people to station at Myriad Medicine Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">And the Myriad Medicine Sect would also send some disciples to station in the Southern Bean Kingdom's capital and Fire Persimmon  Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
