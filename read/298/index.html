<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo arrived at the courtyard and saw Zhu Xuanji. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zhu Xuanji was still dressed in a bright red brocade robe with black embroidered edges. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">His square face was expressionless as he looked at Ning Zhuo, scrutinizing him from head to toe with sharp eyes that seemed to be able to penetrate his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo was well-prepared for Zhu Xuanji's uninvited visit. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">More accurately, this was part of his plan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">During the palace examination, Ning Zhuo deliberately exposed many things. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">For instance, he used multiple floating mechanical constructs in his beginning fight against Sun Lingtong to severely injure the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, preventing Sun Lingtong's victory and leading to a significant drop in his battle record.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In that battle, Ning Zhuo demonstrated his familiarity with the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng. Observant individuals realized that Ning Zhuo knew quite a bit of inside information. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After this, Ning Zhuo publicly used the Five Elements Transformation Disk without the need for any period of familiarization, revealing his prior knowledge of this mechanical component.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In the recent palace examination, he readily used the Blood Path Diagram, demonstrating a deep level of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">These advantages were all utilized by him in the palace examination to bolster his impressive battle record.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">These also made up the bait Ning Zhuo that intentionally threw out, attracting many cultivators and factions who contacted him privately, offering high prices to purchase them. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">But Ning Zhuo rejected them all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The bait he set was mainly to lure Zhu Xuanji!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After resolving the bet between him and Ning Jiufan, Zhu Xuanji finally came to him voluntarily. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Facing Zhu Xuanji again, Ning Zhuo felt much less pressure than during the time at the children's orphanage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">At this moment, he had already confessed and rectified his mistakes, eliminating several flaws. More importantly, through various arrangements, he had elevated his righteous identity to new heights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The branch family Clan Leader of the Ning family! This was undoubtedly a high position within a cultivation family. Becoming a branch family Clan Leader at the Qi Refining Stage was almost unimaginable under normal circumstances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">But Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity fate provided, continuously leveraging the Lava Immortal Palace and the palace examination to elevate his value, ultimately achieving this outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Previously, Ning Zhuo had at most two identities: one as a young genius of the Ning family branch and the other as the master of the black market. During the time at the children's orphanage, Zhu Xuanji could easily deal with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">But now, Ning Zhuo had acquired a third identity — the branch family Clan Leader of the Ning family. This neccesitated that Zhu Xuanji be more cautious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">If it were a demonic or evil sect cultivator, they wouldn't care about this. But Zhu Xuanji was a righteous cultivator and a member of the royal family, respecting the excellence of rules to the core. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Especially now, he needed to rely on the alliance of the Zhou, Ning, and Zheng families to counter the Meng family and the Void Sect to help him vie for the position of the Lava Immortal Palace's master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo knew well that although his cultivation hadn't changed, his status had risen significantly, allowing him to change his attitude towards Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He cupped his fists in salute, first greeting respectfully, then tactfully expressing that his time was limited and hoping the conversation with Lord Zhu could be brief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zhu Xuanji laughed heartily, pointing at Ning Zhuo, "Just became a branch family Clan Leader, and you're already showing off. 'A petty person intoxicated by success' — that's your current demeanor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo also laughed, "Lord Zhu, this is something I fought hard for with all my might. If I don't show it off, wouldn't it be a disservice to my previous efforts?" This candid demeanor made Ning Zhuo appear sincere and not hypocritical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhu Xuanji had a good impression of Ning Zhuo. On one hand, he felt a sense of accomplishment. He believed it was he who guided Ning Zhuo, a young genius, onto the right path. On the other hand, Ning Zhuo's performance in the palace examination, severely injuring the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and causing Sun Lingtong's record to plummet, was a definite merit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Lastly, whenever Ning Zhuo encountered Zhu Xuanji or Ning Jiufan in the palace examination, he would voluntarily concede. Such an attitude was very much in line with Zhu Xuanji's wishes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">That was why, although Zhu Xuanji had long noticed that Ning Zhuo had concealed much information — namely the how he had omitted revealing the entire truth during his previous confession and rectification — he waited until now to inquire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Zhu Xuanji stared into Ning Zhuo's eyes, "Speaking of which, I haven't thanked you yet. In the second round of the palace examination, it was thanks to your concession."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo hurriedly waved his hand, "Lord, you're too kind. I dare not accept such praise! My Five Elements Soldier's power and utility can't compare to your mechanical construct."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"You didn't need me to concede; I was bound to lose anyway. Conceding voluntarily saved time and effort." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Zhu Xuanji clasped his hands behind his back, "Ning Zhuo, tell me honestly — does your Ning family want this Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Let me be honest with you first. If your Ning family has this intention, I can also help by actively stepping back, allowing you to control this treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Among the three major families of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the Zhou and Zheng families are deeply rooted, while your Ning family comes from the Northern Wind Kingdom, with unstable foundations. You are the best ally for our Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family to unite and counterbalance the local powers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo didn't hesitate at all and immediately smiled bitterly, "Lord Zhu, you speak frankly, so I will also speak from the heart. Personally, I haven't been without such fantasies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"However, the Lava Immortal Palace is too damaged. Just repairing its current dilapidated state would be terrifyingly costly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Our Ning family's foundation can hardly bear it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"What's even more frightening is that with the palace examination still ongoing and the beast tide intensifying, the Immortal Palace will inevitably suffer more damage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Whoever obtains it will have to pay a huge price to repair it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"For my Ning family, I believe that helping you achieve final victory and establishing a good relationship with the royal family is the most beneficial and stable development direction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhu Xuanji nodded and said no more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo exhaled a breath of turbid air. He knew that Zhu Xuanji didn't truly intend to give up the position of palace master. Even if he did, Zhu Xuanji actually had no right to give it up, as there was still a third round of the palace examination after the second round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">It would be truly foolish for Ning Zhuo to show interest in the position of palace master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhu Xuanji's words were merely a reminder to Ning Zhuo to not to have desires that didn't match his identity simply because he became a branch family Clan Leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He was also reminding Ning Zhuo not to covet things he shouldn't obtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This was like what Ning Jiufan said to Ning Zhuo in the room before, "There are things you can say and things you can't. Remember, you are already the branch family Clan Leader of the Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This sentence was directed at Ning Zhuo and also at the Golden Core stage cultivator Zhu Xuanji in the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Many high-level exchanges were like this, gentle and implicit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zhu Xuanji was satisfied with Ning Zhuo's attitude and finally got to the point, "You should know my purpose in seeking you this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply and saluted Zhu Xuanji again. With his current confidence, he could speak frankly to some extent, "Lord Zhu, I did indeed conceal some things before. There are many things that are hard to speak of."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"I anticipated today's situation long ago and prepared something after much contemplation. This is the best I can do."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">With that, Ning Zhuo took out a piece of paper from his bosom and handed it to Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhu Xuanji took it, unfolded it on the spot, and saw a poem written on it—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Alone, I linger among white clouds, Clouds drift to distant mountains, the moon boundless. With the moon, we forge a century-long alliance, Planning lies with man, success with heaven."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He frowned slightly, then relaxed, looking at Ning Zhuo and nodding gently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Whether Ning Zhuo truly had a contract with the Void Sect that he couldn't speak of, or whether Ning Zhuo chose to retain some information for his own benefit, Zhu Xuanji chose to acknowledge it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Then, he slightly raised his finger, exhaled a breath of mana, and conjured a flame. The paper was thrown into the air, igniting and quickly turning to ashes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zhu Xuanji turned and left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Recently, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been paying more attention to Zhu Xuanji. When Zhu Xuanji arrived at Ning Zhuo's residence, it immediately caught its attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Throughout Ning Zhuo's interaction with Zhu Xuanji, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit observed everything. Naturally, it also saw the poem on the paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">It felt puzzled, "What does this mean?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit became restless and decided to contact Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Young master, are you alright?" It feigned concern at first, then began to inquire about the paper and the poem's meaning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Rest assured, I merely used a little trick to send him away once more." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit continued to press for the meaning of the poem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo laughed, "Haha, it's unspeakable, unspeakable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He then changed the topic, "Didn't you want to bombard the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest and destroy the Golden Furnace Ruins outright? I've already made up my mind to do so! It will be launched in the coming days. You must be ready at all times to heed my call."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was overjoyed. It had been worrying about how to persuade Ning Zhuo to carry out this attack. Unexpectedly, Ning Zhuo couldn't withstand the pressure and agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">After dismissing Zhu Xuanji and placating the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Ning Zhuo began to gather his subordinates. Soon, Ning Xiangguo, Ning Xiangqian, Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others gathered together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo displayed the Ning family plaque and the ancestral tablet he had obtained to everyone. The crowd was overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"It's done, the branch family matter is finally settled!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Leader, you're incredible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Clan Leader, we can establish our own branch now." The atmosphere in the hall was lively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo smiled, giving everyone ample time to express their joy. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Once the excitement subsided, he addressed one person in the hall, "Leader of the Turtle Breath Gang, have you completed the intelligence gathering I asked for?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang, known for his expertise in intelligence gathering, had been specifically assigned by Ning Zhuo to work in the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He immediately replied, "The past words and deeds of the Ning family members during this period have been mostly collected. Although there are inevitably some leaks, those who believe in rumors or had even secretly spread them and belittled you, young master, have all been recorded."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The atmosphere in the hall suddenly quieted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo took a sip of tea, slowly put down the cup, and said, "Very good, very good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He looked at everyone in the hall, "My uncle lost his son; it's understandable that he would do such things. He wants to use public opinion to achieve revenge for his son's death."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"But those who followed him, the instigating branch family members, have many with ulterior motives."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Even if they're merely foolish, it proves that they're not the kind of people we need to recruit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"What do you all think?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The crowd dared not speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">With a faint smile, Ning Zhuo exerted a strong psychological pressure on them. In just a few breaths, Ning Chen's back was already warm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to say, "The matter of establishing a branch family and setting up our own household must be kept secret. I need to carefully assess who truly supports me and who isn't aligned with us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Everyone quickly expressed their understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Although they had a strong desire to establish a branch family as soon as possible, Ning Zhuo's reasoning was legitimate and reasonable, leaving no room for rebuttal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"I have some tasks for you to complete." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo took out a crystal stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This was a top-grade spiritual item given to him by Zhu Xuanji but its ice attribute spiritual power were completely depleted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo ordered his subordinates to set up a formation to contribute their mana, purify it into ice attribute spiritual power, and infuse it into the spirit crystal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The crowd received the orders and left enthusiastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The prospect of establishing a branch family excited them just by thinking about it. Without needing Ning Zhuo's encouragement, they were eager to perform well and complete every task assigned by him earn a higher position within the branch family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo kept the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang behind for a private conversation, instructing him to closely monitor Zhu Xuanji's actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This task of surveilling a Golden Core stage cultivator put pressure on the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang but he had no choice but to comply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Only when Ning Zhuo was alone did he let out a long sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The reason he fought for a branch family was merely to eliminate flaws.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This time, through the excuse of assessment, he postponed the establishment of the branch family to avoid implicating Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Even Ning Xiangguo, the spy, had developed some feelings after being used for so long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo didn't know if he would succeed in the future, so he needed to maintain distance from everyone at this time. It was to prevent future mishaps — if he became a wanted criminal, he wouldn't be dragging these people down with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
