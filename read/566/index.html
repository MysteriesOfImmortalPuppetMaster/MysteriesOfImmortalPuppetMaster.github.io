<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Tu Ming also possessed divine powers, and among the Nascent Soul cultivators, he was known as a True Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He himself was also of high position and power, serving as the high priest of the Hundred Poison Tribe. The Cangyue Tribe, the Guteng Tribe, and the Hundred Poison Tribe were the three largest barbarian tribes in the Thousand Peaks Forest, each with a population of about one million.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But throughout the battle in the Thousand Peaks Forest, Tu Ming achieved little and his accomplishments were pitiful, showing merit only in the initial ambush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He felt extremely frustrated; if it had not been for Shen Qinghe’s terrifying power, he would undoubtedly have achieved more victories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Alas, reality is reality; Tu Ming's life was now hanging by a thread, and he could only rely on reinforcements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">However, everyone in the Hundred Poison Tribe, from top to bottom, had specialized solely in poison techniques, and were as insignificant as little chicks under Shen Qinghe’s hand. Wasn’t the vast Dutan Mountain completely wiped out by Shen Qinghe?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Shen Qinghe loathed all poison cultivators in the world, and had long been intent on capturing and killing Tu Ming; at this moment, she meticulously searched the mountain, examining every mu carefully, leaving no chance for Tu Ming to escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">As Tu Ming watched the azure spiritual light about to shine upon him, he inevitably fell into despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">But Shen Qinghe’s actions hesitated slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">She received a flying message, in which the astonishing changes on the front battlefield were described.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“What? Commander Du has been stabbed by Young Master Sheng Xu once again, and his injuries are so severe that he can only withdraw the army?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Shen Qinghe’s first reaction was disbelief; she suspected that this was a ploy by Tu Ming and the other enemies, meant to deceive her into withdrawing voluntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">But the seal on the flying message exuded the aura of national power from Two Note Nation, which was genuine and extremely difficult to forge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“It seems that Tu Ming’s life force was not yet exhausted,” Shen Qinghe sighed inwardly, and then transformed into a streak of azure light, swiftly flying away, leaving Dutan Mountain behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The reason she was able to penetrate deep into Thousand Peaks Forest was because the Two Note Nation’ great army had held the central area, providing Shen Qinghe with operational space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Now that the great army was gradually retreating, the speed at which the Thousand Peaks Forest allied forces would react was unpredictable. If they reacted and organized a counterattack, it would be very dangerous for Shen Qinghe and others if they were still inside enemy territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Fearing that she would be besieged, Shen Qinghe could only withdraw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The defeated army of Thousand Peaks Forest gathered together in one place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Lord Long! Wu wu wu…” Many soldiers covered their faces and wept, their sorrow and anger intertwined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The commanding general had died in battle, causing sorrow to pervade the ranks of the remaining troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Not only Lord Long; the Dragon King Temple faction, which was the main force in this battle, also suffered the most grievous casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Chen Lingfeng was being carried; he had long fallen into a state of unconsciousness, and from time to time his body convulsed violently, with froth spouting from the corner of his mouth, his eyes rolling back and staring widely, his eyelids unable to close no matter how he tried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This was the price of overusing one’s innate talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The latest intelligence had reached Lu Hongtu, and at first he did not dare to believe it. Only after confirming it without error did he exclaim loudly, proclaiming the matter to everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The soldiers all wore expressions of stupefaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After they came to their senses, cheers gradually arose, though sporadically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Among them, some cultivators proposed taking the opportunity to counterattack and kill the enemy, but few answered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">More people refuted, saying that although Du Tiechuan was injured, he had not died in battle. If they returned to fight, their side would still have to face the formidable Two Note Nation’ army. What was the difference from before?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The difference was that Lord Long had already perished in battle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Who could uphold the overall situation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Lu Hongtu observed everyone’s reactions and shook his head in his heart: “Morale is difficult to utilize.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Even if Young Master Sheng Xu made contributions and Du Tiechuan was severely injured, and the army withdrew voluntarily, it would be difficult to change the morale of the Thousand Peaks Forest allied forces. The latter generally had low fighting spirit and were more inclined to cease hostilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Unless I step forward and forcibly organize an army, or maybe Xiang Yue would do…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“However, the charisma of the two of us could only influence a small portion, and could not be compared to Lord Long at all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Enough.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“This result is actually very good!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Lu Hongtu was pleased to see such a development.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In this battle, he had achieved many military merits, widely spreading his family’s reputation, and had forged good relations with cultivators and forces from various sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">It could be said that in terms of diplomacy, he and the Six Cave Sect had experienced an enormous enhancement within Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In terms of spoils of war, Lu Hongtu had also reaped a great deal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Overall, the gains outweighed the losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The greatest loss for the Six Cave Sect was in the faction of the Demon Heart Cave Master. The beloved son of the Demon Heart Cave Master, Lin You, had perished, and the cave master himself barely escaped with his Nascent Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">And the Blood Shadow Cave Master and the Poison Scorpion Cave Master - truly the individuals Lu Hongtu had carefully selected - both fought fiercely on the front line and survived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Of the two major Soul Formation Level combatants dispatched by the Two Note Nation this time, one has died and the other was injured; they will not be mobilizing their armies again in the short term.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King chose to target the Old Stone Monster, and his hostility became evident. Although it was not the genuine Old Stone Monster, essentially, Thousand Peaks Forest had already fallen into internal strife.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“The higher-level forces have all suffered heavy losses, leading to standoffs and being preoccupied with their own troubles; isn’t this precisely a great opportunity for our Six Cave Sect to expand massively and continue its rise?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Lu Hongtu evaluated the various major forces in Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The largest faction, the Dragon King Temple faction, suffered the most grievous losses. Lord Long, as the outward face of the Longwang Temple, his death in battle was an enormous loss for the faction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Among the former Lord Long’s trusted aides, Wu Hen had been captured alive, and although Chen Lingfeng survived, his own disarray had caused considerable trouble and losses for his own army, resulting in a loss of trust, creating numerous enemies, and a significant decline in reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Under such circumstances, with no one in the faction inheriting Lord Long’s political legacy, it bizarrely transferred to an outsider - Xiang Yue!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Therefore, Lu Hongtu predicted, “Xiang Yue has received Lord Long’s bequest, and his personal strength has greatly increased. Moreover, his performance in the second great battle earned him much respect and recognition; he will be a representative among the demon cultivators.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“And I, on the other hand, am the leader among human cultivators in Thousand Peaks Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“The barbarian forces have suffered great losses!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“The Biteng medic of the Guteng Tribe has perished, only managing to retreat at the Nascent Soul stage. Di Lu of the Cangyue Tribe had died earlier, not even his Nascent Soul remaining. Only Guya remains to support the overall situation. And as for the Hundred Poison Tribe…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“I also wonder whether Tu Ming is dead or not? If he died at the hands of Shen Qinghe, then the Hundred Poison Tribe will also head towards a complete decline, having to cede many of its original territories.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Even if he did not die, judging by his performance in this battle, he had been defeated almost every time, and his reputation had plummeted.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The more Lu Hongtu thought about it, the more his heart burned with passion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The old forces, which had originally filled and occupied many territories, had all experienced significant declines in strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Six Cave Sect and the Pale Barbarian Cultivators, having benefited from the war, would surely rise!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Lu Army Division, what would I gain if I, Li Jiuqu, joined your sect?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">It was Li Jiuqu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">This Gu cultivator, during the great battle, had been defeated by Mo Yecheng, losing many Gu insects, and his strength and reputation had both declined significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He also saw the rising trend of the Six Cave Sect, and thus proactively requested to join.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“With such a powerful demonic cultivator joining, our Six Cave Sect’s strength is bound to increase greatly!” Lu Hongtu was filled with surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Just as he was about to lead his subordinates in grand plans, before he even took action, he had already achieved a great stroke of success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">It was truly marvelous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Meanwhile, in another place…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Nascent Soul True Lord Bai Ling leaned against a pine tree, looking at the surrounding cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">They were, respectively, Ju Bing, Qian Ye, and Jin Tunhe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Bai Ling slowly spoke: “I have gathered you here because we are all demon cultivators.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Bai Ling himself was originally a white crane, Ju Bing was a wild boar, Qian Ye was a fox, and Jin Tunhe was a toad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ju Bing and Qian Ye looked at Bai Ling intently, while Jin Tunhe yawned and appeared drowsy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He had consumed too much during this battle, and continued to sleep in order to digest quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Bai Ling glanced at Jin Tunhe: “I will be brief. In this great battle, although the great army of the Two Note Nation withdrew, they preserved their strength very well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Our side on the front battlefield had already suffered two defeats, and the most recent one incurred even more severe losses.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“You and I are both demon cultivators who love freedom and a solitary life. But in the future, I’m afraid that the Two Note Nation will mobilize their armies again, and by then, will Thousand Peaks Forest still have such fortune?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ju Bing directly inquired: “So, Lord Bai Ling, what do you intend to do?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Bai Ling smiled slightly: “It’s very simple, we must join forces and help each other.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Qian Ye: “Should we contact the Elephant King? He is also a demon cultivator, after all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Bai Ling fell silent for a moment: “Xiang Yue is currently missing, but judging by his strength, unless he has encountered a Soul Formation Level opponent, let’s discuss first and then contact him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Boom, boom, boom…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Xiang Yue pursued Ning Zhuo all the way; with each step he took, the ground trembled, emitting a roar, with soil and stones flying, and dust rising.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He transmitted telepathically with his divine sense: “Ning Zhuo, where do you think you’re going to escape to? Stop immediately and tell me what’s happening. If you dare to be slippery, I will surely tear you in two!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But Ning Zhuo said: “Elephant King, don’t be impatient; this place is still close to the battlefield. If we go a bit further, it will be even safer and more secure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Xiang Yue was already impatient: “You have said that several times already; do you think I am easy to coax? Stop immediately!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Saying this, Xiang Yue suddenly made a move, employing martial arts, his speed skyrocketing, and in just a few steps, he caught up to the rear of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He extended his large hand and reached directly to grab the back of Ning Zhuo’s neck. If he grasped firmly, Ning Zhuo would be lifted like a little chick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">At the critical moment, a voice suddenly resounded: “Elephant King, calm down.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Zhu Xuanji suddenly appeared, engaging Xiang Yue head-on in a fierce confrontation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Both of them retreated a step, forming a standoff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Xiang Yue looked at Zhu Xuanji in astonishment: “A mere Golden Core cultivator, and yet you are evenly matched with me? Who might you be?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Several divine abilities on Zhu Xuanji’s body quietly receded; he shook his numb-from-the-shock fist and said: “I am Zhu Xuanji, a member of the royal family of the Southern Bean Country.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Xiang Yue thought for a moment: “South Bean Divine Inspector?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He clenched his fist: “Once more!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Xiang Yue’s muscles tensed as he employed martial arts, and blood flames ignited on his fist as he swung it again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Zhu Xuanji, unperturbed, unleashed his divine abilities; for a moment, golden light enveloped him, jade aura spread, and within the golden energy, mountains and forests emerged, each tree with golden branches and jade leaves, resplendent and noble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The two clashed fiercely once again, both retreating, evenly matched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Xiang Yue maintained a righteous expression, all because Zhu Xuanji, in opposing him, had only used his physical body, divine abilities, and so on, without resorting to any of his magical treasures or national weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“Although I did not use my full strength, it was about enough.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“The key is that on two consecutive occasions, both Zhu Xuanji and I each retreated a step; what does that indicate?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“That indicates that he also did not use his full strength, merely matching my force with the same force!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Thinking this, Xiang Yue softly exclaimed: “Good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He relaxed his fist, letting his arms fall naturally, and quickly acknowledged Zhu Xuanji: “Was my encounter with Qiu Hongfeng arranged by Southern Bean Country?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Zhu Xuanji said: “Elephant King, all of this is merely a matter of chance, and my Southern Bean Country is simply going with the flow, playing a leisurely game of chess.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Xiang Yue’s heart sank; Zhu Xuanji’s frank admission forced him to reexamine the lover he had longed for day and night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Qiu Hongfeng…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Xiang Yue was a deeply passionate man, moreover, Qui Hongfeng even carried his child.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Pale Barbarian Elephants had difficulty in reproduction; Xiang Yue, in order to propagate his tribe, had repeatedly sought the Elephant Vein Fertility Pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">And there was a law in this world: the higher one’s cultivation, the harder it was to breed descendants with bloodlines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">As the Elephant King, Xiang Yue, compounded by these two factors, had an extremely low possibility of breeding offspring. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He could not possibly not pursue his lover and progeny!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“Sigh!” Xiang Yue deeply exhaled, glanced at Ning Zhuo, and fixed his gaze on Zhu Xuanji, “What does your Southern Bean Country want me to do?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“Wait a moment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo suddenly waved his hand, “I will take my leave first; you two gentlemen continue your discussion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Although Ning Zhuo was close with Zhu Xuanji, and the South Bean royal family’s Zhu family and the Ning family had an alliance, Ning Zhuo had never lost his proper sense of propriety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Zhu Xuanji, representing Southern Bean Country, had made arrangements in Thousand Peaks Forest; this was a state secret, and Ning Zhuo did not wish to know too much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">But Zhu Xuanji replied, “Don't worry.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo chuckled and still chose not to stay, but instead withdrew voluntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Zhu Xuanji revealed a confident and composed smile: “Ning Zhuo, even if you do not wish to listen, do not hurry to leave; I have news about your mother, and this piece of intelligence is extremely valuable to you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo was taken aback, and once he recovered, his face changed drastically, unable to conceal his excitement: “Lord Zhu, is what you say true?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">This time, it was Xiang Yue’s turn to chuckle: “Is this the modus operandi of the South Bean Divine Capturer?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Having been caught at his weak spot, he had no choice but to comply; as a result, upon seeing that Ning Zhuo was also caught at his weak point, his dislike for the latter diminished considerably, and he took the opportunity to sneer at Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">However, Ning Zhuo did not harbor much animosity toward Zhu Xuanji; instead, he felt gratitude: “Old Zhu is one of the few who knows my true intentions. I did not expect him to secretly gather intelligence for me and do so much. Truly, Old Zhu is a good person.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo then voluntarily distanced himself, allowing Zhu Xuanji and Xiang Yue to have a private conversation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He went to a mountainside, gazing into the distance at the mountain scenery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The afterglow of the setting sun, the dying sun like blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">This great battle had begun at dawn and continued until dusk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Just then, a strong mountain wind blew in, stirring the pine waves between the mountains like rolling tides, and also causing Ning Zhuo’s long hair to flutter and his robes to fly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The rosy glow of the clouds shone upon Ning Zhuo’s entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo wore a white robe stained with blood; having just escaped a major battle, his body was still seething with hot blood, his eyes shining, and his energy was abundant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">At this moment, as he recalled scene after scene on the battlefield, thinking of the life-and-death struggle between enemies, with each character appearing in all their splendor, each displaying their abilities, it was all breathtakingly magnificent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The Mechanical Princess was willing to be the pillar, Mu Lan the Divine Arrow was fierce and intimidating, Xu Dali fought bitterly, Zhao Xi the obedient fled in panic, Lord Long sacrificed himself fighting to the death, Xiang Yue demolished all opposition, Li Jiuqu was cunning and treacherous, Chen Lingfeng went demonic and mad, Jin Tunhe possessed extraordinary talent, Lu Hongtu was experienced and steady, Ding Bijia Wan harbored killing intent, Du Tiechuan wielded Soul Formation Level might, Young Master Sheng Xu overturned the battle situation…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Also, the Fire CLoud Camp incinerated countless enemies, the White Jade Camp was completely wiped out, the Three Generals Camp became increasingly seasoned, and the Red Flower Camp achieved numerous battle victories…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">All these scenes whirled through his mind like a cavalcade, stirring his emotions so that he couldn’t help but let out a light howl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The youthful howl resonated through the mountains and forests, and it also stirred up a gust of mountain wind that rose from the earth, swirling like a surging azure sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">“Without traveling, how can one personally experience such a brilliant life?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">“I would love to experience such a battlefield again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">“To clash with various heroes, to exhaust one’s wit and effort in life-and-death battles to display one’s brilliance, and to witness the glory of others, it is like drinking a strong liquor that leaves one intoxicated.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“Boss, I suddenly understand you now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Ning Zhuo transmitted telepathically to Sun Lingtong: “Is this the thrill you have been pursuing?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Sun Lingtong suddenly experienced a burst of inspiration, his eyes turning, and said: “This is what is called: A Man Should Shed Battlefield Blood, Drunkenly Wield the Azure Blade to Pierce the Splendor of the Sun.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ning Zhuo chuckled lightly: “It’s rare for the boss to be in a poetic mood.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Sun Lingtong giggled and exclaimed: “I just thought of that line.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Ning Zhuo said: “Then let me complete it for you, boss.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">He thought for a moment, and in only three breaths, he murmured:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">“The divine arrow shatters clouds, fire illuminates the rosy clouds;</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="296">The wild blade drinks blood, and iron blossoms into flowers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The three armies cause thunder to shake the mountains, and with one howl, the wind sweeps up the yellow sands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="298">After countless battles, who would not be reduced to ashes, yet after a thousand calamities, one’s spirit remains unaltered as vast as the horizon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">A man should shed battlefield blood, drunkenly wield the azure blade to pierce the splendor of the sun!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">As soon as the words fell, Zhu Xuanji appeared, and everyone praised, “What a good poem!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
