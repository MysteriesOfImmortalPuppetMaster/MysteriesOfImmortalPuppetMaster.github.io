<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 291: Wait, the Mechanical Ape in the Trial Room?!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Isn't it the mechanical ape we encountered in the trial checkpoint?!" "Why is it appearing here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"It's being controlled by Sun Lingtong, which means we've been set up by the scoundrels of the Void Sect all along?!" The reformation team members who entered the second round of the palace examination were shocked beyond words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Some were so enraged that they cursed Sun Lingtong loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Too treacherous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Too cunning!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Such a despicable villain!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Who in the reformation team hasn't been tormented by the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng? Even Ning Zhuo, the true master of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, has played along many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In short, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng is a sore spot for the reformation team, a shadow, an object of countless gritted teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">To deal with the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai, the three reformation teams once joined forces for a major campaign.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">It was unsuccessful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng brought too much failure, too much humiliation, too many setbacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Previously, everyone thought it was just one of the mechanisms in the trial checkpoints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This understanding made it easier for everyone to accept psychologically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After all, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng originated from the three sects' masters, and it was understandable that everyone lost to such a Void Refining powerhouse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">But now, with Sun Lingtong openly using the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, everyone suddenly realizedâ€”we weren't defeated by a Void Refining powerhouse, but were tricked by the scoundrels of the Void Sect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">And tricked so many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">If not for the second round of the palace examination, we would have been kept in the dark forever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">At this moment, this kind of suffocation and resentment couldn't be washed away even with the waters of three rivers!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Curse you, Sun scoundrel!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"I curse you Void Sect people, may your sons be born without anuses!!" "Not fit to be human, simply not fit to be human!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sun Lingtong became the most glaring presence in the main hall square. Countless pairs of fiery eyes stared at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ineffective curses and insults poured down like a torrential rain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">At first, Sun Lingtong was a bit uncomfortable. Later, he found it quite enjoyable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Savor it carefully, it's quite thrilling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Hehe!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"I just love seeing you hate me yet unable to defeat me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Ah, yes, it's me defeating you instead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Hehe..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong was smug, shaking his head, his small face flushed with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">After using the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, he immediately started a terrifying winning streak. Even Zhu Xuanji and others were consecutively defeated by him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The most frustrated person was none other than Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Argh! Vile scoundrel, to toy with us to such an extent, I, the great one, will twist your head off and use it as a ball!" "I'm so furious, so furious!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Meng Chong roared repeatedly, yet could only watch as his mechanical puppets, without the advantage of numbers, were brutally ravaged by the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Past memories resurfaced, turning into slaps that struck his face one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Too painful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This humiliation was truly excessive for a proud son of heaven like him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Meng Chong was so angry that his face turned red, his hair stood on end, and he rolled up his sleeves, ready to rush to the central area to personally confront the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In the end, an invisible force firmly blocked him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong didn't forget to add insult to injury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He extended his little finger, picked his ear, and looked at Meng Chong with disdain: "Little weakling, what are you shouting for? Haven't I tormented you enough?" In an instant, the struggling Meng Chong froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Then, his eyes filled with blood, and he seemed about to explode, roaring to the sky with a deafening shout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I'll defeat you, I'll defeat you!!" Meng Chong was so angry he lost his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">No matter how the people from the City Lord's Mansion tried to dissuade him, it was useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhu Xuanji, the Book Master, and others, however, did not let anger cloud their judgment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Rather than saying I lost to Sun Lingtong, it's more accurate to say I lost to this intelligent mechanical ape." "This ape is indeed formidable. With equal cultivation, even I find it hard to resist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"According to the information from the second round of the palace examination, the mechanical ape was brought out from the trial checkpoint, so it can be used in the palace examination." "By this calculation, the Void Sect should have another mechanical puppet that can control ghosts." At this point in the discussion, even these elites among the Golden Core stage cultivators fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Sun Lingtong had only revealed one trump card, yet he already had such a huge advantage. He hadn't even used another trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"It can be foreseen that the first place in the second round of the palace examination will again be the Entry Standard!" "Fortunately, the second round of the palace examination only eliminates the last ten, so advancing to the next round isn't difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"The mechanical ape came from the trial checkpoint, why didn't the reformation teams from the four forces find this reward? Is it deeper in the trial checkpoint?" Everyone kept speculating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">No one told them that there was an insider who concealed the paths of the Buddhist Gate and Demonic Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">With the help of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, Sun Lingtong made a big splash, immediately stopping the decline and rebounding strongly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The reason for arranging the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng instead of the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai was mainly considered by Ning Zhuo: the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was already exposed the most, so exposing it a bit more didn't matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Although this mechanism was later enhanced with a lot of Foundation Establishment stage materials, it ultimately only had Foundation Establishment stage combat power, unable to stand on the stage against Zhu Xuanji and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">It could only show off on the platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai was different!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Although its material was also limited to the Foundation Establishment stage, it contained the Golden Core of Qi Bai from his lifetime, and if fully utilized, it had Golden Core level combat power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Of course, if fully utilized, the mechanical body often couldn't withstand it, as it was only made of Foundation Establishment level materials. This was the biggest shortcoming of the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai that had existed for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">In summary, keeping the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai and exposing the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng to secure Sun Lingtong's spot in the next round was a very wise decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">And Ning Zhuo himself, while everyone was attracted by the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and Sun Lingtong, "stumbled" and "struggled" to "fight hard" and "difficultly" secured victory after victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Besides Ning Zhuo and others, the least surprised was Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He had previously discovered the secretâ€”Yuan Dasheng had been refined into the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He also knew that Yuan Dasheng's corpse had fallen into the hands of the Void Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Thus, the conclusion that the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng belonged to the Void Sect was naturally deduced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">However, Zhu Xuanji did not expect that the Void Sect could actually bring out the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng only had Foundation Establishment level combat power, which did not make Zhu Xuanji take it seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Seeing Sun Lingtong using the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng to dominate, even defeating himself, this result made Zhu Xuanji pay more attention to another matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">That was the clue about the golden furnace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Among the five golden furnaces that had already been used to ruins, the first golden furnace didn't need investigation, as Zhu Xuanji already knew the inside story. The fifth golden furnace had just been investigated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He only had the second, third, and fourth golden furnaces left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In the dark, a premonition told him that the answers hidden beneath the ruins of these three golden furnaces were extremely important to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">However, since the last success, the opportunity Zhu Xuanji had been waiting for had never appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Although there were situations where scarlet flame beasts approached, each time they were blasted away by Ning Zhuo's early activation of the Five Elements Tower before they truly reached the Gourd Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This prevented Zhu Xuanji and others from using the scarlet flame beasts to delve into the ruins of the golden furnaces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The opportunity appeared after the fifth question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Accompanied by an earth-shattering roar, a massive flame lizard emerged from the lava.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Nascent Soul level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The second Nascent Soul level scarlet flame beast appeared in the beast tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Its target was directly the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Meng Kui immediately took action, relying on the Immortal City Grand Formation to intercept the Nascent Soul level flame lizard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The two sides fought for over a dozen rounds, and the fire snake that had previously fled seemed to seize the opportunity and charged over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">For a moment, Meng Kui faced two Nascent Soul level beasts alone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He wielded four large hands of mana, blocking left and right, clearly at a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The flame lizard slammed into the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The previously only slightly damaged spherical light shield instantly dimmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The flame lizard charged again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The spherical light shield shattered with a loud crash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Countless scarlet flame beasts landed from all directions, storming into the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Five Elements Tower fired wildly, shells like torrential rain, pounding the flame lizard's head and neck. The relentless bombardment caused minor injuries, finally forcing it to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">However, before retreating, the flame lizard swung its tail fiercely, directly breaking off a corner of the palace, causing several buildings along with the land to separate from the main body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Then, this corner of the palace fell into the lava and quickly disappeared completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Such a heavy blow caused the dragon turtle fire spirit to let out a miserable cry in the main hall!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Chaos erupted in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">This was the first time such a large number of scarlet flame beasts had flooded into the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Although the spherical light shield was soon restored, blocking further beast landings, the scarlet flame beasts that had entered were already a huge threat that needed to be quickly eliminated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Cultivators fought with all their might, battling everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">During the battle, due to a small accident, someone discovered that the palace's restrictions were also damaged, creating a loophole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">As long as one was a Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment stage cultivator, even without mechanical expertise, they could enter and exit the palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">This was absolutely impossible before. Mechanical expertise had to meet the standard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"The opportunity has come!" Zhu Xuanji felt a mix of emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">On one hand, the opportunity he had been waiting for finally arrived. On the other hand, with a corner of the Lava Immortal Palace collapsed, the cost of repairing such a significant loss would undoubtedly be enormous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This forced the dragon turtle fire spirit to contact Ning Zhuo again: "L-little master, bombard the golden furnace area! Let Zhu Xuanji completely give up on this!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
