<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 334: Breaking the Situation</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div><paragraph index="0">"This little brat! When you come back, I’ll hang you up and spank you until your bottom is swollen!" Ning Jiufan gritted his teeth in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="2">A flying message, like a bird, kept knocking against the window.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">With a thought, Ning Jiufan opened the window and let the flying message in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">It was a letter from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Ancestor, by the time you read this letter, I have probably already run away from home..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The letter mainly contained Ning Zhuo's thoughts on the current situation with the Ning family, Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and the ongoing power struggle between the Zhu family and the Meng family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">Ning Zhuo predicted: Soon, there would be a huge conflict between the Ning family, Zhou family, against the Meng family for the positions in Lava Immortal Palace. There was also the Great Purity Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">The Great Purity Palace took away a group of Zheng family cultivators, many of which held positions in the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">Ning Zhuo believed that this super sect had yet to give up on controlling the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This could be something to take advantage of.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo left behind a batch of supplies, which would be soon delivered to Ning Jiufan. This gesture was meant to compensate and repay the main branch of the family for their nurturing of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Finally, Ning Zhuo reminded Ning Jiufan that upon his departure, he hadn’t left behind any mechanical constructs, so Ning Jiufan would need to take good care of the branch family. Although the Fire Fusion Demon Ape could belaunch attacks through techniques and artifacts, Ning Zhuo strongly advised against it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">According to his words, fostering loyalty through relationships was the right path!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">After finishing the letter, much of Ning Jiufan’s anger dissipated. He sighed, "This brat... he’s still willing to protect the family in the end."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">"Not only that, but he even dares to meddle in the affairs of his ancestor! Hmph!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">"Wait a minute, could it be that this letter was also part of his calculation? Did he factor in my anger as well?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Jiufan's face clouded with uncertainty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He couldn’t deny that during the struggle for control over Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo’s patience, cunning, and other qualities had left a lasting impression on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">To the point that Ning Jiufan, a Golden Core cultivator, was now filled with doubt, suspecting that Ning Zhuo had tricked him again and factored him into the plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">After pondering for a moment, Ning Jiufan exhaled deeply, resolving not to overthink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Overthinking is useless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">"Ning Zhuo is inherently good-hearted, loyal to the family. Though occasionally sly, he has his limits. Such talents need to be honed further."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">Ning Jiufan concluded his thoughts about how to solidify Ning Zhuo’s status. Perhaps instead of posthumous titles, they could emphasize Ning Zhuo’s contributions, increasing his loyalty to the family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Besides, during the Yin World Ritual, when the family performs its small offerings to communicate with the underworld, you should personally seek higher blessings and protections for Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">At the City Lord's Mansion...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">"Ning Zhuo is gone?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"A Nascent Soul-level mechanical construct, using secret techniques to escape... I didn’t understand the Lava Immortal Palace well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">Fei Si, reading the report, felt a wave of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">How could one allow another to sleep peacefully beside their own bed?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">Although Ning Zhuo’s cultivation was weak, his demonstrated battle strength and cunning had left those in the know deeply wary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Fei Si was no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zhu Xuanji departed from Fire Persimmon Immortal City the following afternoon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">As he ascended into the sky, he couldn’t help but look back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Fire Persimmon Mountain loomed beneath him, its jagged peaks like a giant awakening from sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">After the violent volcanic eruption, the cooled lava at the mountain’s lower levels had formed a patch of red and white ground, covering the slopes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">The traces of the lava flow resembled massive veins, twisting and winding, recording nature’s powerful roars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Further up the mountain was the vast complex of buildings that formed Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Although some parts were damaged, the city remained largely intact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The threat of destruction from the demon beast tide had been averted thanks to the citizens’ unity and resolve, and the crisis was ultimately overcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">At the base of the mountain were small patches of persimmon orchards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">Though the next Fire Persimmon Festival was still months away, the volcanic eruption had brought a surge of heat that the city’s protective arrays absorbed, converting it into an abundant persimmon harvest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Where the tree branches were once bare, clusters of large persimmons now hung, newly formed. The red, round fruits looked like the future hope of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">However, the city’s outlook seemed as mysterious and uncertain as the heavy clouds that often shrouded the mountaintop, ambiguous and not necessarily foreboding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">Zhu Xuanji’s eyes flashed with golden light, piercing through the clouds to see the crater, where the Lava Immortal Palace floated atop the molten rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The palace was being rebuilt, with Meng Kui personally leading the effort. He used his magic to retrieve fallen fragments from the lava, while numerous other cultivators worked with him, fully dedicated to piecing the broken palace back together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">"The Master of the Three Sects..." Zhu Xuanjii showed a trace of fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">These days, whenever he had a moment to reflect, his mind involuntarily replayed the scene of him, at the last critical moment, turning against Meng Kui to aid Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">That moment, he had, as if guided by some unseen force, used his Golden Phoenix Mirror to target Meng Kui’s mighty magic hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">This single action had put the Southern Bean royal family at odds with Meng Kui, directly preventing him from dealing a lethal blow to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">“At that time, was it really my own decision to assist Ning Zhuo? Or... was I already under his influence?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">After the event, Zhu Xuanji often recalled that pivotal moment, feeling uneasy, as if he had been manipulated like a puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">Yet, as time passed and he revisited those thoughts, his suspicions blurred, making it seem as if his actions had been instinctive—his body reacting faster than his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Now, having replayed the scenario countless times, Zhu Xuanji found himself doubting everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">As Fire Persimmon Immortal City gradually faded behind him, Zhu Xuanji couldn't help but reach up, feeling the top of his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">“Was a Life Hanging by a Thread attached to me that day?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He felt nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The memory of a past scene from the royal capital floated to the surface of his mind. A line spoken by the Master of the Three Sects grew increasingly chilling as he pondered it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">At that time, the Southern Bean Empress had taken the metal mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Master of the Three Sects had said, "Fate is sealed. Since he has taken the metal mirror, let him protect the Immortal Palace’s legacy for a while."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Strangely, the further Zhu Xuanji flew from Fire Persimmon Mountain, the more peaceful and calm he felt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">It was as though a wild beast had escaped a giant trap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">A sense of danger arose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Lava Immortal Palace... something is definitely off."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">A strong intuition emerged, telling Zhu Xuanji to stay as far away from these places as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"And Ning Zhuo too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Limit your interactions with him as much as possible. After all, he’s the chosen one of the Master of the Three Sects—the destined child for the Buddha-Demon conflict."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">As Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, and the others departed, Fire Persimmon Immortal City gradually returned to its peaceful atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">With no more Crimson Flame Beasts rampaging and the Lava Immortal Palace no longer leaderless, the visiting cultivators also began leaving Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">In the Flying Disc Workshop of Fire Persimmon Immortal City...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">An elderly man in white robes with graying hair sat in a mechanical chair, cultivating his magic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">The chair floated a few feet off the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">His eyes were sunken, his breathing deep—it was Chen Cha.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Suddenly, Chen Cha’s body convulsed violently, as if struck by lightning. He abruptly opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">His pupils were completely gone, leaving only eerie whites.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">From those whites, wisps of white smoke drifted out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Chen Cha seemed like a different person, quickly turning his head and scanning the surroundings before focusing intently on the direction of Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">His fingers moved slowly, leaving afterimages in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">As he calculated, the white smoke in his eyes grew thicker, giving Chen Cha a misty, ethereal appearance, like an immortal shrouded in fog.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">"Zhu Xuanji should have stayed to guard the Immortal Palace. Why did he leave?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">"And Meng Kui too! He’s gone as well!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">"This situation was orchestrated by the Master of the Three Sects. Logically, there shouldn’t have been any mistakes. The Immortal Palace used the Life Thread Divine Ability. It should’ve been completely foolproof! But now the situation has turned out like this? Who could be behind this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">"Now that this is ruined, most of my plans in the Southern Bean Kingdom are ruined as well. What a headache. How can this be fixed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">After completing his calculations, Chen Cha looked distressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Could it have been Ning Zhuo who ruined this plan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"For now, the top priority is to find Zhu Xuanji and Ning Zhuo to find the root of the problem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">After this thought, Chen Cha slowly closed his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The white smoke filling the room quickly dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">His breathing returned to normal as he resumed his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">After one incense stick’s time, Chen Cha opened his eyes again, his pupils restored. His magical power was fully replenished, and he began studying the mechanical texts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">These texts had been specially arranged by Ning Zhuo for delivery to Chen Cha before he left the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Meeting Ning Zhuo was my good fortune," Chen Cha thought, his heart filled with gratitude as he absorbed the knowledge from the jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He seemed completely unaware of the strange incident that had just occurred, with no memory of it whatsoever!</paragraph><br/><br/>
