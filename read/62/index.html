<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The next moment, Fei Si pushed the door open and entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zhu Xuanji stared at Fei Si with deep eyes. “You came quite quickly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Fei Si smiled, though there was bitterness in that smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Given Zhu Xuanji’s special identity, Fei Si made sure to watch his every move. Although no explicit orders had come from the City Lord, Fei Si still knew what he had to do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Thus, when Zhu Xuanji and the others returned from the volcano and headed straight for the Flying Disk Workshop, Fei Si received the news immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Flying Disk Workshop and Chen Cha were both closely connected to Fei Si. Now that the Fire Persimmon Festival was nearing, he urgently needed as many explosive fire monkeys as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The upcoming Fire Persimmon Festival was Fei Si’s responsibility. He didn’t dare to be careless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Once he heard that Zhu Xuanji was heading to the Flying Disk Workshop, he could no longer sit still and immediately rushed over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“First of all, I have nothing to do with the emergence of the immortal palace,” Fei Si began. “Second, this all started from a small mistake on my part.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He proceeded to explain that he had been worried about the livelihood of the citizens and concerned that the Southern Bean royal dynasty’s property would be damaged, and thus hastily presented the explosive fire monkey to the City Lord, believing in error that Chen Cha was the creator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">When he realized his mistake, Chen Cha suggested covering things up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Fei Si was hesitant at first, but Chen Cha persuaded him persistently, and he eventually assented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Chen Cha then privately approached Ning Zhuo, requesting that Ning Zhuo transfer the identity of inventor to him in exchange for a heavy reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The two then signed a contract to jointly keep the secret. (In truth, this was Fei Si's direct order to Chen Cha, with the contract added afterward.)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Nice story,” Chi Dun sneered, staring at Fei Si. “But I know you’re lying.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zhu Xuanji’s frowned deepened. With his technique, he could tell that much of what Fei Si said was false, but the general outline was still true.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Considering that Fei Si was a Golden Core cultivator with high status and in charge of the day-to-day affairs of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Zhu Xuanji chose not to expose him outright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zheng Shuanggou turned to Ning Zhuo, looking at him with new eyes. “So you’re the real inventor of the mechanical monkey.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo hurriedly bowed again and expressed his gratitude for Zheng Shuanggou's favor of saving his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Zheng Shuanggou had once saved the remnants of a Ning Clan expedition team at the peak of the volcano. Ning Zhuo, Ning Yong, and Ning Chen had all been among those present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zheng Shuanggou smiled. “Since you remember my favor, how will you repay me?” He was clearly interested in recruiting Ning Zhuo, having seen his talent in mechanical arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly. “As a cultivator of the Ning Clan, I may not be able to fully repay you, sir, but I will do my best.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zheng Shuanggou waved his hand. “Forget it, I won’t make things difficult for a junior like you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo was surnamed Ning. Forcibly recruiting him might cause trouble with the Ning Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The three clans were already discussing an alliance to oppose the City Lord Mansion. Since Ning Zhuo was recultivating, whether or not he joined Zheng Clan no longer really mattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhu Xuanji turned to Ning Zhuo again. “You were at the scene when the immortal palace appeared?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo: “Yes. I was lucky enough to survive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Haha. I know about that,” Chi Dun laughed. Having heard some dirt on Fei Si, he was clearly in a good mood. “After the incident, I went and interrogated many people. The cultivators of Ning Clan were among the first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“At that time, aside from the normal heart-questioning formation, I also had the Warning Heart Bell that Sir City Lord personally bestowed upon me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“It was precisely thanks to the Warning Heart Bell going off that I was able to detect the hidden black shadow demonic cultivator. Afterward, I gave chase, and the demonic cultivator escaped into Fire Persimmon Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Zhu Xuanji nodded and asked the key question: “When did you start creating the explosive fire monkey? Was your blueprint ever leaked? Did anyone else know about it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Moments later, Zhu Xuanji learned that some explosive fire monkeys had been sold even before the immortal palace emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">On the very day Ning Zhuo consulted Chen Cha and formed a partnership, they had immediately begun producing and selling explosive fire monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">According to Chen Cha, it was because he needed to test the market response to appropriately decide on investment and production scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo claimed that his blueprint hadn’t leaked, but he was merely a Qi Refining cultivator. He might not even be able to tell if someone was spying on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">In short, this lead was a dead end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Tracking down every single buyer of an explosive fire monkey was something that made Zhu Xuanji’s scalp go numb just from imagining it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">And that would only account for the direct purchases.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In reality, a single mechanical monkey could easily pass through multiple hands after being resold several times…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At this point, Zhu Xuanji had completely lost interest in the Flying Disk Workshop, Chen Cha, and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">As he was leaving, Fei Si saw him off. “Sir Zhu, there’s really no need to go to such trouble in this investigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“The Fire Persimmon Festival is nearly here. At that time, we’ll encircle and suppress the black shadow demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“As long as we capture them alive and interrogate them with the Divine Investigation Bureau’s methods, the mastermind will surely be revealed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">These were Fei Si’s true thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">As the one handling most city affairs, every single second of his day was calculated with an extreme focus on efficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">To him, Zhu Xuanji’s extensive investigation seemed like a terribly inefficient waste of effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The culprit was hiding in the Fire Persimmon Forest. Once they captured the real culprit, wouldn’t that solve everything in one go?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhu Xuanji let out a cold snort and looked at Fei Si. “I understand what you mean. Don’t worry. On the day of the Fire Persimmon Festival, I will be there in person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“I really want to meet that black shadow demonic cultivator face to face!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Fei Si smiled. These words were exactly what he had hoped to hear, an assurance of reinforcements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Zhu Xuanji, as a member of the Divine Investigation Bureau, possessed formidable combat power. Moreover, he was someone from the royal family, so he surely carried some powerful treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">With him joining in, the odds of capturing the black shadow demonic cultivator would rise significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zhu Xuanji left the Flying Disk Workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Soon after, Zheng Shuanggou bid farewell to Zhu Xuanji and took his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Only Chi Dun remained. His thoughts were actually similar to Fei Si’s; he wanted to catch the black shadow demonic cultivator during the Fire Persimmon Festival and solve the core problem directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhu Xuanji sneered. “Do you really think the black shadow demonic cultivator is the true culprit of the immortal palace bombing?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Chi Dun was stunned. “You mean he isn’t?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Zhu Xuanji shook his head. “Don’t be blinded by assumptions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Take a look at the current clues. The immortal palace emerged after suffering damage from a bombardment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“The bombardment was carried out by a mechanical monkey. That’s a mechanical construct that could be controlled by anyone.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Chi Dun stopped in place. Zhu Xuanji’s words made a lot of sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“But if it’s not the black shadow demonic cultivator, who else could it be?” He racked his brain, then suddenly trembled, showing an expression of disbelief. “Could it be... Zheng Shuanggou?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Zhu Xuanji shook his head again. “Anything is possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Just think – what if the black shadow demonic cultivator isn’t the true culprit? If we mistakenly go along with that assumption and waste valuable time investigating in the wrong direction, how will we answer to our superiors?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Chi Dun nodded. “Sir Zhu’s words are correct. But hasn’t the lead on the mechanical monkey gone cold?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhu Xuanji smiled faintly and looked up at the sky. “Chi Dun, you’ve forgotten that there’s actually an even more critical lead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“The direct cause of the explosion that damaged the immortal palace wasn’t the mechanical monkey, but that thousand jin of fire essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Buying that much fire essence in one go would surely leave an impression on the seller!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Chi Dun clapped his hands in excitement. “Yes, yes! Now that is a solid lead.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zhu Xuanji turned to him. “So next, I want you to lead me around the immortal city’s markets for investigation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Understood, Sir!” Seeing hope for the investigation, Chi Dun replied with renewed enthusiasm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
