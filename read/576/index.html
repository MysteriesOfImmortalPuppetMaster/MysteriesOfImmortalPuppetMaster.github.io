<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A sickly green flame fiercely burned upon the massive paper statue near the southern gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Someone tried to quell the flames, conjuring a surging tide of water to extinguish the fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Yet, as soon as the waves crashed down, the green flames suddenly shifted into a blazing yellow inferno. The flames greedily fed on the surging waters, intensifying severalfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo gazed into the distance, a subtle awe stirring within him. "This flame has some unusual tricks. It seems capable of converting water into fuel for its fire. If I could witness it firsthand in combat, perhaps I could discern its secrets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">With his profound mastery over the Five Elements, Ning Zhuo knew several methods to feed flames with water. Whether this flame’s principle was similar or not, Ning Zhuo was confident that a closer look would enable him to grasp its intricacies entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Soon, the waters receded, having only further nourished the flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The yellow-green flames enveloped the entire statue, causing it to crash violently to the ground. The shattered remnants triggered a massive shockwave, sending clouds of dust and debris spiraling into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Witnessing the destruction, Ning Zhuo felt an inexplicable heaviness in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He turned to Sun Lingtong, speaking solemnly, "Boss, White Paper Immortal City is in utter chaos. A renowned Immortal City with powerful defensive arrays, yet someone could still wreak havoc like this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"The fact they could openly battle and even burn down such a significant landmark clearly indicates that the city's defenses are compromised. There must be traitors everywhere, or else the city’s defensive arrays alone would suppress these intruders completely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Even from afar, without clearly observing the specifics of the fight, the extent of damage alone revealed how little resistance these attackers faced from the city's protective formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Otherwise, such extensive devastation wouldn’t be possible!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sun Lingtong nodded gravely, fully concurring. "White Paper Immortal City is beset by internal strife and external threats. Turmoil is inevitable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The city’s defenses were typically extraordinary, far surpassing even the frontline encampments of the Two Note Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The defensive arrays significantly weakened invaders' cultivation bases and combat capabilities, giving the defenders immense territorial advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Had the Two Note Kingdom’s forces occupied an immortal city during the second battle at Thousand Peak Forest, the battle's outcome would have been entirely different. Indeed, the allied forces would never even have dared to assault such a strongly fortified location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Any thought Ning Zhuo had of closely observing the battle evaporated at that realization.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Although we didn’t gather detailed intelligence before entering the city, from what we've seen so far, White Paper Immortal City is clearly in a precarious state, teetering on the edge of collapse," Ning Zhuo continued thoughtfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"The external threat is obviously the ghost tide. With White Paper Immortal City Lord seemingly incapacitated, the shadow cast upon the city’s defense grows even darker."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"The internal threat, meanwhile, must be the City-Overthrowing Alliance. We already know that the Bone Crocodile Demon is part of their ranks. Xie Sichao, the Yin Soldier tactician, undoubtedly represents a certain faction from the Underworld. The alliance’s cooperation with outside forces magnifies their danger immensely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo sighed softly. "White Paper Immortal City is clearly a land of chaos. We shouldn’t linger. Boss, let's quickly find Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer. After we get her divination results, we leave immediately."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Yet Sun Lingtong held a different view.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He shook his head slightly, transmitting his thoughts through spiritual sense. "Don't be hasty, Little Zhuo. Neither of us has faced a ghost tide before. Experiencing it firsthand might be quite enlightening."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Moreover, the greater the danger, the richer the rewards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Think carefully - our wealth and fortune has multiplied by countless times now. Why? Because we risked our lives and participated in the great battles of Two Note Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"This current crisis in White Paper Immortal City could very well be another major turning point for us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong continued persuading, "Little Zhuo, we actually have an advantage now. With your current identity as a male consort, you can gain access to the city's top echelons!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Should an opportunity arise, your identity alone could bring us unprecedented opportunities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. "You make sense. But why do I feel like, Boss, you’re mostly just looking for excitement?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Sun Lingtong chuckled. "Just tell me, is what I said wrong? Are you intrigued?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo again fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Indeed, he was tempted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Had this been Fire Persimmon Immortal City or back at Myriad Medicine Sect, he’d have immediately voted against lingering and urged a swift departure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But now...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">His risks had truly yielded immense rewards. The battlefield had opened his eyes to deeper understandings about life itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Alright then. We'll use this identity first, approach the city's upper ranks, and test our luck for opportunities," Ning Zhuo conceded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong was overjoyed, nearly clapping Ning Zhuo on the shoulder. "Little Zhuo, you're finally speaking my language! Had I known this earlier, I'd have taken you out adventuring years ago!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo added thoughtfully, "But from what I see, it's unlikely. If I were the city lord, I'd scrutinize every male consort approaching her with utmost suspicion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"We might not even pass the initial check."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong nodded gravely, "Though my thieving techniques have significantly improved, I'm still uncertain about passing the scrutiny of an Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Well, we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Even if we're exposed, we can always reveal our true identities. Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer has considerable status here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Even if punished, we can always flee using the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon Escape."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Having settled their plan, they continued onward, blending in with the rest of the group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Shortly thereafter, they arrived at a separate manor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Three bold characters adorned the plaque at its gate - Hidden Yang Manor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The gray paper lion statues guarding the entrance noticed the group and immediately spoke, "Newly arrived male consorts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Their guide promptly confirmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Enter," commanded the gray paper lion, opening the gates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The group filed in, and as soon as they entered, paper servant-maids greeted them courteously, "Please follow me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Led past a screen wall, through a grand hall, traversing three winding corridors lined with blue tiles, and penetrating five layers of gloom-infused barriers, they reached an elegant little garden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Everyone, please wait here briefly. The steward will soon arrive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Half a cup of tea later, a middle-aged human cultivator wearing a silver robe leisurely approached. He scanned the newcomers with an air of superiority, tilting his head back slightly, and arrogantly announced, "Newcomers, listen well. There are three things today: meals, familiarizing yourself with the grounds, and room assignments."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"From today onward, you'll reside here for a while. I expect excellent behavior from all of you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">With hands clasped behind his back, the steward departed slowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Strange, no inspection at all?" Ning Zhuo exchanged puzzled glances with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">At midday, a paper servant-maid led everyone to the dining hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Upon entering, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong discovered it bustling with at least a hundred people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Are all these people really...?" someone questioned in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The paper maid nodded calmly, "Correct, they're all this batch's male consorts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Everyone exchanged awkward glances, falling into uneasy silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Seating was unassigned, so everyone sat freely. Sun Lingtong was about to sit beside Ning Zhuo when a paper guard harshly reprimanded him, "How dare a mere ghost race servant presume to sit with the male consorts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Not willing to separate from Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo quickly explained, "He's my lifesaver."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">However, the paper guard unleashed another torrent of rebukes, completely disregarding Ning Zhuo's supposed status. Slightly stunned, Ning Zhuo glanced at the crowded hall, swiftly realizing the true position of male consorts here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Sun Lingtong subtly signaled Ning Zhuo, promptly separating from him and crouching down by the wall, joining the other servants to eat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Just as Ning Zhuo was about to start his meal, another paper attendant approached, "Jiao Ma, the Head Steward summons you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"What's it about?" Ning Zhuo questioned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The paper attendant sneered coldly, "You're new here yet already breaking rules. Obviously, it's to discipline you. Did you think it was good news?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Speechless, Ning Zhuo was escorted to a private chamber, once again meeting the silver-robed steward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Savoring sumptuous dishes and picking his teeth lazily, the steward addressed Ning Zhuo, "Jiao Ma, you've broken rules as soon as you've arrived. A punishment is warranted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo, with neither humility nor arrogance, cupped his fists respectfully and responded calmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Seeing his composed demeanor, the steward slightly restrained his arrogance, "Judging by your manner, you must hail from a wealthy background. Not ignorant of rules, but perhaps overly confident due to wealth? Tell me, how much money did you bring for me? Only then can I assign you a decent room."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo was momentarily taken aback by the steward’s brazen demand for a bribe but quickly recalled the steward’s earlier remarks in the garden. Clearly, rooms varied greatly, and the steward exploited this to openly solicit bribes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Newly arrived and uninformed, Ning Zhuo aimed to gather intelligence, "Head Steward, could you clarify the price for rooms here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The steward snorted disdainfully, "Who am I to explain things to you? You're here as a male consort and didn't even do your homework?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Hand over the money, and I'll arrange accordingly. Got it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo, immensely wealthy, knew the steward would never believe the full extent of his resources. Even a trivial fraction would delight the steward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">But after some thought, Ning Zhuo rejected this route. Shaking his head, he sneered back defiantly, "Hey! THis Young master despises your kind of behavior the most. Initially, I thought of tossing you a bit to shut you up. But now? Forget it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">With that, he turned and strode off confidently, leaving the steward frozen in shock, staring blankly as Ning Zhuo disappeared from sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Wait- "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"No way!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"How is this guy even more arrogant than me?!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
