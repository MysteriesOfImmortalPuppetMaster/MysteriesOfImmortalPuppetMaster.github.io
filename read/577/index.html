<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Without sparing a glance backward, Ning Zhuo turned and left decisively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The elderly steward watched Ning Zhuo's departing figure and felt an urge to rebuke him, yet the words choked back in his throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"This pock-faced boy is odd indeed. Could he have someone backing him, making him fearless against us?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Otherwise, how could he act so arrogantly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Suspicion brewed deeply in the steward's heart. Feeling the depth of the waters here, he decided to swallow his grievance for now and carefully investigate Ning Zhuo's background first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">When Ning Zhuo returned to his seat in the dining hall, he instantly drew the attention of those around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong continued crouching inconspicuously in the corner, quietly eating his meal. Ning Zhuo’s departure and return had been closely monitored by him. Should anything unusual arise, he'd leap out immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Upon sitting down, Ning Zhuo found himself quickly captivated by the spirit dishes placed before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">First was the Cinnabar Soul Jelly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">It was a translucent, crimson square dessert, its surface shimmering with numerous mysterious runes, reminiscent of the Yin-Nourishing Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Taking his first bite, Ning Zhuo initially felt nothing. Yet soon after, sourness, sweetness, bitterness, and spiciness surged forth simultaneously, twisting his expression as the overwhelming assault on his senses became nearly unbearable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But the sensations vanished almost as swiftly as they'd arrived, like a fleeting life, emotions scattering swiftly in wind and rain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">A lingering melancholy overcame Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Next came the Wheel of Reincarnation Black Algae Rolls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">These were made from sheets of dry yellow tofu skin wrapped around black algae harvested from the Underworld River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Nibbling slightly, Ning Zhuo grimaced instantly. The tofu skin was bland and papery, akin to biting into layer upon layer of charm paper. The algae itself was unbearably salty, nearly causing him to spit out his own tongue in disgust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Then there was the Branding Iron Rib Steak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Blackened to the point of resembling iron, the rib bone felt heavy in Ning Zhuo’s grip, and he immediately experienced a sharp stabbing pain within his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Forcing himself, he bit down with difficulty. The meat was stubbornly tough, requiring immense effort merely to tear off a few pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">As he chewed, a powerful burning sensation quickly spread, tormenting him from within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Finally, the main dish was a basin of Tongue-Pulling Sliced Noodles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">These tongues were disturbingly fresh, wriggling restlessly inside the basin - some leaping, others licking or curling in protest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">When Ning Zhuo tried one slice, it struggled furiously within his mouth, resisting being eaten. After finally managing to chew, an overwhelmingly sour sauce erupted forth, assaulting his palate so aggressively that he thought his teeth might dissolve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After just one slice, Ning Zhuo found it nearly impossible to continue. The sharp acidity had invaded every corner of his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This lunch provided by the Hidden Sun Villa was truly beyond description.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo was comparatively fortunate. Many others who had just arrived embarrassed themselves spectacularly, drawing jeers from the watching male consorts who relished the newcomers' discomfort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Hahaha, rookies, you have much to learn."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"You can't even handle eating a meal; what else are you good for?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"You might as well crawl back home now, save yourselves some embarrassment!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Frustrated, some newcomers tried using their energy to suppress the rebellious spirit food in their mouths. However, they were swiftly discovered and whipped by nearby paper servants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The paper servants harshly reprimanded, "These spirit delicacies were meticulously crafted by our City Lord’s Manor at great expense and effort!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Using your energy carelessly will taint these dishes and cause a tremendous waste."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"If you can't even finish a meal, better get lost now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The reprimanded cultivators flushed red, quietly enduring the humiliation without daring to further employ their techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo, determined and persistent, continued chewing diligently, swallowing mouthful after difficult mouthful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">His motivation was clear - though these dishes tasted dreadful and were challenging to consume, their effects were remarkable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">By the time Ning Zhuo had finished the meal, he was delighted to discover that the foundation of his soul had surged impressively, reaching a strength two hundred and twenty times that of an ordinary person's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"One meal gave me such substantial growth!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"If I stay here for some time, merely eating meals could push my soul foundation past the thousand-fold mark!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">After lunch, most of the veteran male consorts departed the dining hall, leaving only Ning Zhuo and the other newcomers behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At this point, Sun Lingtong emerged quietly from his corner, transmitting a message discreetly with his divine sense, "I just spoke with other ghostman servants here. They mentioned that when their masters first arrived, they generously bribed the elderly steward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"For newcomers like us, the sort of living arrangements we get assigned now could be absolutely crucial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Perhaps we could imitate them and strive for a large residence ourselves?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The male consorts were mostly humans, with very few ghostmen among them, creating a distinct division between newcomers and veterans. The atmosphere wasn't exactly welcoming. However, the ghostman clansmen themselves got along famously, often enthusiastic in assisting and advising each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“I have some news as well…” Ning Zhuo concisely summarized his recent conflict with the elderly steward to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sun Lingtong became curious. “Little Zhuo, knowing your character and your usual saying about small sacrifices for greater ambitions, why would you be so protective of your money this time and avoid bribery? You must have another plan, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“You truly understand me, boss,” Ning Zhuo praised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Then, slowly and clearly, he explained his rationale: “White Paper Immortal City is currently troubled both internally and externally. Since our identities are disguised, exposure would lead to severe complications. Being mistaken for undercover agents from the City Overthrow Alliance would spell disaster.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Our top priority right now is to gather information.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“The second priority is to remain inconspicuous and not attract undue attention.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“As for bribery, we’ll wait for the right opportunity.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Sun Lingtong quickly grasped Ning Zhuo’s logic. “You're saying there's likely someone from the City Overthrow Alliance hidden among the male consorts?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Precisely.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“The City Lord of White Paper City needs Yang energy to cultivate. Her condition is critical to the city's survival against this ghost tide, a fact that's undoubtedly not lost on the City Overthrow Alliance. They would certainly infiltrate the ranks of the consorts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“So, we must remain low-profile and act ordinarily,” Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement. “If we can deduce this much, surely the upper echelons of White Paper City have anticipated the same.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“What’s suspicious, however, is how we became consorts with practically no vetting.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“This might be a deliberate setup by the City Lord. Under such uncertain conditions, it's safer to watch quietly from the sidelines.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Having reached an understanding, the two dropped their concerns about securing a better residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Follow me closely, I'll show you around. Remember the paths clearly - don't wander and cause trouble. If you do, you’ll bear the consequences!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Two White Paper attendants approached the group, sternly cautioning everyone before leading them out of the dining hall for a tour.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Hidden Yang Manor boasted extensive facilities: the Paper Puppet Martial Grounds, Underworld Kitchen, Dining Hall, Soul-Cleansing Bathhouse, Quiet Mind Pavilion, Scripture Library, Garden of Abstinence, and Yang-Sealing Shadow Wall - everything a male consort could require for cultivation, daily living, and social activities was well-covered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The tour wasn't superficial; each location was explored thoroughly, with everyone encouraged to practice until proficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">By the time the inspection concluded, evening had fallen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo and the others returned to the dining hall for dinner. The evening meal tasted worse than lunch, yet upon consuming it, Ning Zhuo found his soul essence improved by around thirty individuals’ worth - slightly better than the noon effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">After most had dispersed, leaving only the newcomers in the hall, the elderly steward returned unexpectedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Residence A-01: - Jiao Ma!” declared the elder, astonishingly assigning the finest accommodation directly to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong exchanged shocked looks: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
