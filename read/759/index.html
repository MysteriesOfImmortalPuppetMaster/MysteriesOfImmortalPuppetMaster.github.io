<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Cultivator Hao stared at Ning Zhuo, his gaze dark and contemplative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He had personally witnessed Ning Zhuo's repeated leaps in progress, culminating in the acquisition of his fifth Profound Armament Armor and qualification for the Third Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A sudden realization struck him: "Ning Zhuo came prepared!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"He has absolute confidence in his learning ability. This entire process was part of his plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Is this what a true genius looks like? Such unwavering self-assurance! Even when facing the Ban Clan and Ban Ji, he remained utterly confident. He truly believed that even if he sharpened his spear at the last moment, learning on the fly, he could still suppress and intercept Ban Ji?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Is this unparalleled confidence, or simply another form of arrogance?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on the ground, introspecting and reviewing the recent battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">So this is what they mean by "no technique surpasses technique"? It's truly formidable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This reminded Ning Zhuo of a saying among Confucian cultivators: "Act according to your heart's desires, yet never transgress the boundaries of propriety."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">A skilled Confucian cultivator could act freely, following their heart's desires, without ever violating the social norms and established methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"The principle of 'no technique surpasses technique' is essentially the Martial Dao's 'acting from the heart without transgressing the rules,' isn't it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Though each strike appears to lack a specific technique, flowing freely from the heart, it's actually rooted in the realities of combat. Every movement, from the exertion of physical force to the wielding of weapons, adheres to the fundamental principles of martial arts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo suppressed his admiration and turned his thoughts to another pressing matter: "My martial arts training has reached its limit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Even without resorting to extreme measures like hanging his head from the rafters or piercing his thigh with an awl, he had reached his peak, unable to progress further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Currently, Ning Zhuo's martial arts cultivation realm remained at the Martial Artisan level, still a considerable distance from the Master-grade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">One of the hallmarks of the Master-grade was the ability to transcend technique, achieving victory through instinct and intuition. Ning Zhuo fell far short of this standard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"None of the Demonic Cultivators I absorbed had reached the Master-grade in the Martial Dao. Their foundational knowledge simply wasn't sufficient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Even if they had, relying solely on others' memories and experiences to reach the Master-grade would be impossible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The reason was simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Achieving the state of "no technique is superior to technique" requires meticulous mastery of fundamental skills, seamless combinations, and abundant, adaptable tactical thinking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Even if Ning Zhuo absorbed the experience and memories of a Renowned Master of the Martial Dao, he couldn't immediately satisfy the two requirements mentioned above.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">His body differed from others' in height, arm span, flexibility, and more. The weapons he used also weren't identical to those used by others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">These differences meant that even if Ning Zhuo mastered techniques and combos, he couldn't perfectly replicate them. He could achieve precision, but not microscopic accuracy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Furthermore, his temperament differed from others', leading to different choices in many situations and variations in tactical strategies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">To develop "rich and flexible tactical thinking," Ning Zhuo had to train diligently and engage in constant real-world combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Master-grade Martial Dao techniques can't be easily replicated. They carry strong personal characteristics, so I must rely on my own hard work and struggle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Unless... I can receive a direct infusion of cultivation realm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">If Ning Zhuo's Martial Dao cultivation realm were directly elevated to Master-grade, or even higher to Grandmaster levels, achieving "no technique is superior to technique" would become effortless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Looking back now, Ning Zhuo increasingly realized the immense value of the opportunity he had gained at the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect - the Five Elements Divine Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Even if I can't reach Master-grade myself, refining this spear is equivalent to having the guidance of a Renowned Master of spear techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"That's the true worth of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Of course, it's ultimately just armor - an external object. Its reactive responses, governed by the Martial Dao, can't match the skill of a Cultivator who has truly reached Master-grade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo thought of Ban Ji: "According to intelligence, he's only been training with close-combat weapons for a few years. It's highly unlikely he's reached Master-grade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Unless he's had some extraordinary opportunity or possesses exceptional Innate Talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"This greatly increases my chances of defeating him. If I can prevent him from obtaining all nine pieces of the Profound Armament Armor, that will be a success!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Encountering the Bronze Shield was a pleasant surprise. Everything is proceeding according to plan so far."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo's simultaneous study and practice weren't spur-of-the-moment decisions but part of a meticulously crafted plan he had devised before setting out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The practical combat opportunities ahead were invaluable - once this chance was gone, it wouldn't come again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo seized every practical combat opportunity, willingly investing more time and energy to drastically improve his combat skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Upon arriving, he immediately encountered bronze shields and bronze spears, instantly realizing the immense value of his training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"If I hadn't mastered the Way of Illusion and Reality, I wouldn't have been able to sense the Force. Even with a shield, the spear's impact would have shattered my bones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Now that I've mastered five Profound Armament Armor pieces, I'm ahead of schedule. Advancing to the Third Trial shouldn't be a problem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">This was all thanks to encountering the bronze shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Next, the sixth Profound Armament Armor piece will be even stronger, leading to a qualitative leap in my combat power!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"I need to give it my all while ensuring my physical condition remains intact. I can't afford to sustain serious injuries. Otherwise, when the required number of participants is reached and the Third Trial begins, I'll face a chaotic free-for-all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo didn't rush to his feet. Instead, he focused his divine sense and channeled spiritual energy, causing the five Profound Armament Armor pieces to float around him, continuously practicing combat techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"I previously developed three combined sword and blade techniques. Could I incorporate more Profound Armament Armor pieces into them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">With a clear grasp of the situation and no longer feeling rushed, Ning Zhuo resumed his practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">After practicing for a while, Ning Zhuo's head began to throb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Combining two weapons in combat was already exceedingly difficult. Attempting to wield a third or fourth weapon simultaneously was simply impractical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">So, Ning Zhuo secretly called out again, "Big Brother, help me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Coming, little brother!" Sun Lingtong had been preparing all along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">On the surface, Ning Zhuo appeared to be facing the trials alone, but in reality, the two brothers were working together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Brothers united, their combined strength can shatter gold!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Meanwhile, Ao Pan's right arm bulged with muscle as he swung his Bronze Blade, attempting to break through the enemy's relentless assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The sixth Profound Armament Armor he faced was a massive Battering Ram, specifically designed to breach city gates. Now, however, it was focused solely on Ao Pan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ao Pan's sword strikes were fierce and powerful, but the Battering Ram was brutally relentless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">With each clash, the Bronze Blade let out a painful groan, and the massive recoil threatened to shatter Ao Pan's arm bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ao Pan retreated repeatedly, the iron-hard stone ground beneath his feet cracking into a spiderweb of fissures, sending shards of rock flying in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">With a swift motion, Ao Pan's left hand seized the Bronze Long Staff hovering beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ao Pan thrust his long spear forward, its tip piercing the air with a whip-like trajectory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">First, the spear blocked the blow, then the sword followed, finally halting the battering ram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Now!" Ao Pan slapped his waist, drawing a bronze whip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">With the whip in hand, Ao Pan's entire demeanor subtly shifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Crack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The whip's shadow flashed into existence, vanishing as quickly as it appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">When it reappeared, the whip had already coiled around the ram's head, its tip piercing deep into the ram's body like a living thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Countless spiderweb-like cracks instantly spread across the ram's head, bringing the battering ram to a screeching halt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ao Pan lunged forward, embracing the battering ram and channeling all his spiritual energy to refine it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Meanwhile, the bronze whip shattered inch by inch, rendered unusable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"What a pity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"This whip was the first Bronze Artifact I ever encountered. It was both a stroke of luck and a profound loss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">In this critical moment, Ao Pan had still placed his faith in the whip. After all, it was the weapon he had mastered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Now that the whip was gone, the remaining Bronze Artifacts at his disposal felt less familiar and reliable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ao Pan gathered the shattered whip fragments and continued his journey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The battle between Tie Zheng and the Profound Armament Armor had reached its most intense phase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Bronze Blade in Tie Zheng's hand danced like a wheel, shattering three Frost Arrows in quick succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ice shards scattered, and freezing Qi surged along the blade, instantly coating it in a layer of solid ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Tie Zheng decisively released the blade and summoned a Bronze Long Staff with a practiced gesture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He deflected a Flame Arrow with the staff, but the arrow suddenly exploded, unleashing a surging wave of fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The fiery blast scorched his exposed skin, leaving charred marks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Tie Zheng retreated violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Meanwhile, his opponent - a Bronze Bow hovering in the distance - operated autonomously, its string drawing back and releasing with mechanical precision. Azure Frost Arrows and crimson Flame Arrows alternated flawlessly, weaving a deadly net of projectiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Tie Zheng wielded the staff with unwavering precision, maintaining a perfect defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ao Pan was a Golden Core-level Body Refinement Cultivator, his cultivation art emphasizing physical refinement. Tie Zheng, however, was a Golden Core-level Martial Cultivator, having attained at least Master-grade proficiency with various weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">At over three hundred and seventy years old, and having dedicated his life to orthodox martial cultivation, reaching Master-grade proficiency was no great feat for Tie Zheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Precisely because of his mastery, a cold glint flashed in Tie Zheng's eyes. He knew all too well: "Here, most of my techniques are useless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Breaking through the arrow net would require at least moderate injuries."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"That won't do!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Tie Zheng had gathered intelligence and knew that in previous trials, many strong cultivators had recklessly exerted themselves in the second trial, only to be suddenly teleported to the Third Trial and immediately thrown into chaotic battles, resulting in disastrous outcomes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"My physical foundation is inferior to Ao Pan's. I need to conserve my strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"In that case, you're the one I'll use."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Strike, Light Striker!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">From the twelve Beast-Head Bronze Bell Spheres hanging at his waist, one suddenly trembled violently, detached, and shot into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The sphere emitted a piercing shriek as it cracked open mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">A fluid-like stream of bronze flowed out, coalescing into a lithe Bronze Panther Blade Beast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Eyeless and earless, its entire body was composed of countless razor-thin blades vibrating at high frequencies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The Bronze Bow and Arrow reacted swiftly, unleashing three arrows in rapid succession. Two ice arrows sealed off the path, while a fire arrow aimed directly at the Blade Beast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Light Striker moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Its speed was astonishing. Ice arrows pierced only afterimages, and fire arrows were left far behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The Bronze Bow and Arrow fired continuously, creating wave after wave of arrow nets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Agile and swift, the Blade Beast Light Striker pierced through the arrow nets and clamped its jaws onto the Bronze Bow's body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Got it," Tie Zheng murmured, relief washing over him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The cultivators of Profound Armor Cave erupted in uproar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"What's going on?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Isn't there a Formation that prohibits cultivators from using external means?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"No, Tie Zheng isn't cheating. His Blade Beast is actually a Profound Armament Armor in disguise!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Tie Zheng had cleverly exploited the rules of Profound Armor Cave, silencing the skeptical cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">In previous trials, some cultivators had brought their own Profound Armament Armor, which was permitted under the rules.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Profound Armor Cave encouraged such displays, hoping to showcase the value of Profound Armament Armor circulating outside the cave, thereby bolstering the cave's long-term operations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Cultivator Hao mused, "Tie Zheng brought a Bronze Artifact and transformed it into a living Blade Beast. That gives him a significant advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"He remained unscathed on the sixth Profound Armament Armor, maintaining his peak condition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"He might actually secure the final victory and become the first-place winner of this Rising Cloud Trial," Cultivator Hao thought, turning his attention to Lu Zeng's situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Lu Zeng was the last of the three Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">At that moment, he was actively battling the sixth Bronze Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Five Bronze Artifacts surrounded him, launching relentless attacks in waves. Lu Zeng adopted an offensive stance, maintaining the upper hand with unwavering stability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Sharing the same concerns as Ning Zhuo and Tie Zheng, Lu Zeng also employed his signature Mechanism manipulation techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">However, while this strategy prevented injuries, it drained his divine sense at an alarming rate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">As for the Foundation Establishment cultivators...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Zhang Wangxing was the first to engage the sixth Bronze Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">On the battlefield, he was forced to leap and dodge frantically, his movements clumsy and desperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The cultivators from Profound Armor Cave pointed and laughed, treating his plight as a joke - a spectacle they had long anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Zhang Wangxing had previously relied on the unique properties of his Physical Body to exploit loopholes. But against the sixth Profound Armament Armor, which could expend spiritual energy to unleash sword beams, blade Qi, and other attacks, his Physical Body proved woefully inadequate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Zhang Wangxing had no mastery of mechanisms and only a rudimentary understanding of weapons, leaving him immediately overwhelmed in the current situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Following Zhang Wangxing were the Rust Disaster Artisan and Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ban Ji carefully retrieved his severed finger. Though he cultivated Demonic Arts, his primary focus was on the Upper Dantian Divine Sea, granting him formidable divine sense but leaving his physical body frail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He couldn't regenerate the severed finger, and unlike Ning Zhuo, whose wounds could sprout flesh buds to close the gap and reconnect the finger, Ban Ji's completely severed wound offered no such possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Wielding the Bronze Blade with a single arm, Ban Ji displayed a newfound prowess. Even against the Bronze Sword's surging sword light, he could parry and occasionally counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"With a blade in hand, everything changes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"This Bronze Blade is Master-grade. Using it in combat feels like receiving personal instruction from a Renowned Master with every strike."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"This kind of learning is truly addictive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"With enough real combat experience like this, the time it takes for me to advance to Master-grade Martial Artist will undoubtedly be greatly reduced."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Meanwhile, the Rust Disaster Artisan was unleashing his Innate Talent to its full potential, attempting to corrode the sixth Profound Armament Armor before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The results were abysmal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The armor's spiritual energy barrier proved impenetrable, causing the Artisan's talent to repeatedly crash against an invisible wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo pressed his hand to his forehead, feeling dizzy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">He and Sun Lingtong had been working together on their calculations, a process that was proving mentally exhausting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">The brothers were no longer focused on devising weapon combinations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo had heeded Sun Lingtong's advice: "Little Zhuo, instead of trying to create some fancy sword-and-shield combo, why not use our weapons to form a battle formation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"We both know battle formations like the back of our hand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Besides, many of your weapons are already in tatters. The Third Trial will be a chaotic free-for-all. Even if we perfect a combination technique now, will you really be able to use it effectively when the time comes?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Even if you manage to seize similar weapons from others, they'll only be similar, not identical, which will severely compromise the combination's effectiveness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"It's far better to design a battle formation now. When we acquire new Profound Armament Armor in the future, we can simply integrate it into the formation, making us more stable and secure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">After hearing this, Ning Zhuo nodded emphatically. "Big Brother, you're right! I'll follow your lead!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
