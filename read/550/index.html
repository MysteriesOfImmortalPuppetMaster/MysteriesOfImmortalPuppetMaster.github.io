<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“Ah--!” Bi Tengyi screamed miserably, as her flesh was first punctured with countless needle holes under the combined attack of golden needles and bluish-white flames, and then the flames penetrated every opening, attacking both inside and out, quickly incinerating her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Bi Tengyi’s Nascent Soul, however, fled far away, and in the next moment, it traversed the void, completely disappearing from the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Shuang Ling’s eyes shone with divine light; she did not pursue, but instead continued to control the mechanized Pure-World Lotus Platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The lotus platform underwent a transformation; the lotus leaves retracted around the perimeter of the pedestal and began to rotate continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The lotus platform changed from a floating state to being suspended, resembling round mirrors, with the mirror edges being the slowly rotating leaf edges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">At the center of the mirror, a Kunlun Cold Jade Pearl shone with an unprecedented cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Wherever the cold light shone, countless bluish-white flames appeared out of thin air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">From the holes in the round mirror, a large number of golden needles continued to be ejected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The golden needles breached defenses, the flames burned, and the combined assault swept onto the body of the second Nascent Soul cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Among those Nascent Soul cultivators capable of fighting, he was naturally a skilled one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The fate of the mutual attack between Bi Tengyi and Shuang Ling was imminent, thoroughly proving the overwhelming strength of Shuang Ling’s divine ability, and the Nascent Soul cultivator naturally defended with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He struggled to hold on amid the golden needles and flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Support him!” The other cultivators surrounding Shuang Ling, upon seeing this, simultaneously acted in unison, either attacking Shuang Ling or assisting with defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Shuang Ling snorted coldly, and the rotating mechanized round mirror changed once more; the shrinking leaf blades detached from the cylindrical mirror body and continued to rotate around it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">As the leaves rotated, they scattered golden light. After spinning faster and faster, the leaf blades became indistinct, transforming into a ring of golden edge, spinning swiftly and emitting a whooshing sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The golden light spread from the golden edge onto the cylindrical mirror body, quickly permeating it and transforming it into a pure golden mirror surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The bluish-white flames also changed accordingly, becoming a patch of golden-yellow color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The golden needles, enveloped by the golden flames, became entirely reddened after being scorched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Golden flames and crimson needles - their power increased several times over!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In an instant, the Nascent Soul cultivator let out a miserable scream, his defense collapsed, and his flesh was instantly incinerated, leaving only his Nascent Soul traversing the void, fleeing away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The golden flames and crimson needles spread everywhere; wherever they reached, no one dared to resist head-on, and all retreated in a disorderly and miserable fashion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo’s eyes shone brilliantly as he watched, and excitedly clenched his fists, exclaiming, “I’ve figured it out!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Shuang Ling had manifested her divine ability, the Golden Fire Pure-World Wheel, through mechanized constructs, in separate segments.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Each segment was a part of the divine ability, with power ranging from small to large.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“On one hand, having a mechanized physical entity to bear the load made this divine ability convenient and controllable. On the other hand, the power of the divine ability was also controlled, from small to large; not only did it save on the consumption of one’s own spiritual energy, but it could also be maintained for a longer time and switch the magnitude of its power according to the specific enemy situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">This was a clever utilization between the art of mechanisms and divine abilities, filled with Shuang Ling’s ingenuity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">It was like piercing a layer of window paper; seemingly simple, but in fact it was an extremely significant revelation for Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Shuang Ling’s might was dazzling, and her divine ability swept across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Seeing that the battle was about to collapse, Lord Long immediately ordered that more Nascent Soul cultivators be dispatched to reinforce and counter Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">In an instant, the battle reached a state of white-hot intensity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">A large number of spells and magical treasures were cast one after another, and mechanized constructs in the high air formed several lines of defense, keeping Shuang Ling’s defenses so impregnable that not even a drop of water could penetrate, perfectly steady.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Golden Fire Pure-World Wheel divine ability evidently had consumed a great deal of Shuang Ling’s mental energy, so she no longer launched other offensives. The various mechanized constructs that had previously shown agility also solidified the defense and became rigid in their performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred slightly: “In that case, spirituality constitutes a qualitative change for mechanized constructs!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Even Shuang Ling did not have such a means.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“The Cremation Prajna Spirit-Relieving Sutra… this scripture’s value was far greater than I had previously imagined.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Around the mechanized round mirror, changes occurred again, and a second layer of golden edge emerged, causing the entire divine ability’s potency to surge by another four times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Thousand Peaks Forest Allied Army had newly added several Nascent Soul combatants, yet they still could not withstand Shuang Ling’s offensive, and the situation was extremely grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Lord Long furrowed his brows deeply, and Lu Hongtu’s eyes shone with a cold gleam as he respectfully said, “The mechanized constructs themselves are reinforced with military might, and the divine ability’s potency is also magnified.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“To counter divine abilities, ordinary spells and magical treasures will not suffice; only when a True Lord intervenes can the defeat be averted!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It was crucial to suppress Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Once she achieved a great victory, the accumulated achievements of the previous challenges by the Thousand Peaks Forest side would all vanish. Moreover, the entire army of Thousand Peaks Forest would suffer a severe blow to their morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Lu Hongtu’s analysis was spot on!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Divine abilities often needed to be compared against each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Furthermore, the divine ability that Shuang Ling was now activating was not merely ordinary in its potency; it had leveraged far too many factors such as mechanized arts and military might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"True Lord"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Only Nascent Soul cultivators who mastered divine abilities were qualified to be called that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Lord Long looked around, and although there were quite a few Nascent Soul cultivators in the Thousand Peaks Forest Allied Army, those who could be considered True Lords were few and far between.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Tu Ming.” Lord Long called out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The High Priest of the Hundred Poisons Tribe immediately stood up, expressing his willingness to join the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Bai Ling.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The demonic cultivator Bai Ling slowly saluted, his demeanor calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Xiang Yue.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Xiang Yue snorted coldly, leaning against the back of his chair, slightly opening one eyelid, and said, “Temple priest of the Dragon King, you should call me the Elephant King.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Xiang Yue was precisely the current Elephant King of the Pale Barbaric Elephant Tribe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“You!” Many glared at the current Elephant King, Xiang Yue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Lord Long extended his hand to restrain his subordinates, squinting his eyes and smiling as he said, “Elephant King, if the second grand battle is lost aswell, the prospects of Thousand Peaks Forest will truly be grim.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Under a collapsed nest, no egg remains intact; at that time, if your tribe is forced to migrate, where would they settle?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Xiang Yue snorted coldly, “If you want me to intervene, that’s fine; exchange it for an Elephant Vein Fostering Pill.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Lord Long nodded, “Since the Elephant King has spoken, that shall be granted. The Elephant King is truly worthy of being the current leader of the tribe; he has trained extensively for the sake of the tribe’s reproduction and survival.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Too much nonsense.” Xiang Yue said, and only then did he slowly stand up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">As he stood up, he immediately cast a huge shadow on the ground. His burly and robust body stood towering like a section of a city wall, and merely by standing, he imparted a sense of visual oppression to others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At this moment, the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Damn it!” The Demon Heart Cave Lord’s heart pounded like a drum, and his entire body brimmed with demonic qi, transforming into a rainbow bridge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The rainbow bridge carried the Demon Heart Cave Lord, narrowly escaping the deadly entrapment of the golden fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">But hundreds of crimson needles followed closely, seemingly about to hit the Demon Heart Cave Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Father!” At the moment of peril, Lin You disregarded any rules and directly released a mechanized carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The scarlet flying needles struck the carriage, splashing out bursts of sparks and emitting the crisp sound of clashing metal, and were all intercepted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Even Shuang Ling, amidst her busy actions, glanced sideways and caught a glimpse of the mechanized carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Then, she shifted her gaze and directed it to another location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">A crimson needle pierced through the entire body of a Nascent Soul cultivator, with the golden flames raging, and thereby burned to death another strong cultivator of Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The morale of the Thousand Peaks Forest Allied Army was low, and many people’s eyes twitched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">On the side of Two Note Nation, bursts of cheers were heard, and their morale surged to a visibly rapid extent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun and Ning, upon witnessing this scene, both fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Up to now, Shuang Ling had already slain four Nascent Soul-level cultivators; her offensive was resolute, iron-blooded and merciless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“If we do not curb the ingenious Princess, the Thousand Peaks Forest side is very likely to collapse because of this battlefield,” said Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo then realized one thing: “It seems that among the powerful Nascent Soul-level cultivators, only divine abilities could hold the field.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He couldn’t help but think of Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Even though he had participated in the great battle of Two Note Nation and witnessed firsthand the struggles among many Nascent Soul-level cultivators, Ning Zhuo’s horizons were greatly expanded, yet upon reflection, he still regarded Zhu Xuanji as exceptional.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The latter, with only a Golden Core cultivation, had several divine abilities at his disposal, which was simply unreasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">If he reached the Nascent Soul level, that would be unstoppable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Clearly, once Zhu Xuanji’s cultivation reached the Nascent Soul level, he would inevitably become the Nascent Soul representative of the Southern Bean Kingdom, similar to Shuang Ling before his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">And at that moment, three Nascent Soul cultivators simultaneously entered the battlefield to confront Shuang Ling!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Shuang Ling, cease your rampage!” Tu Ming roared, and immediately unleashed his divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Divine Ability - Myriad Serpents Poison Stream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A foul wind suddenly arose, and dark clouds layered upon each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Poisonous rain descended, with the intensity of the rain increasing from small to great.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The rain, extremely toxic, coagulated, turning into dark, long serpents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The myriad poisonous serpents gathered into an army, taking shape in mid-air, then descended upon various mechanized constructs, clinging and entangling, corroding and devouring them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Divine Ability - Crane’s Cry in the Nine Marshes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The demonic cultivator Bai Ling raised his head and let out a long howl, emitting a ferocious sound wave, causing all cultivators who heard it to experience a reversal of their spiritual energy, their blood and energy surging, and their divine seas agitated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Divine Ability - Snow Fang Heaven-Splitting Slash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The current Elephant King, Xiang Yue, nonchalantly swung his palm, using his hand as a blade; seemingly slow but actually fast, he cleaved out a wave of blade qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Shuang Ling’s mechanized formation immediately suffered severe devastation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The poisonous serpents corroded large areas of the mechanized constructs, causing them to disintegrate from corrosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Under the sound of the crane’s cry, many of the talismans on the mechanized constructs self-detonated, the formation patterns became chaotic, and sparks flew from various parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Meanwhile, Xiang Yue’s blade qi, within a few breaths after being released, expanded to an exaggerated extent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The massive blade qi descended from the top, overwhelmingly domineering, crushing everything in its path, cleaving apart countless mechanized constructs, and directly splitting the formation from front to back into two halves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Shuang Ling’s formation became unstable, and she had no choice but to retract her divine ability, the Golden Fire Pure-World Wheel, and control various mechanized constructs to engage the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">This time, facing three True Lords, she appeared to struggle greatly, no longer exhibiting the previous composure and dominant stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“The current Elephant King, Xiang Yue, is he the one who eliminated the Golden Spear Army?” Both Sun and Ning wore solemn expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Thus, they had a rather deep impression of the name of the current Elephant King, Xiang Yue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">At present, having witnessed Xiang Yue’s intervention with their own eyes, they immediately judged that this demonic cultivator was extremely ferocious and should be avoided in confrontation as much as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Tu Ming, Bai Ling, and Xiang Yue attacking Shuang Ling together - no matter how strong she is, she would have a hard time holding out, wouldn’t she?” Sun Lingtong said in a deep voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">It was not hard to see that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The two divine abilities of Tu Ming and Bai Ling had left Shuang Ling exhausted in response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Not to mention there was also Xiang Yue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Fortunately, after Xiang Yue’s first move, he folded his arms and stood proudly in place, not moving any further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">This scene caused Lord Long to frown, and Lu Hongtu couldn’t help but send a mental message, urging, “Elephant King, if you fight passively, I’m afraid that the Elephant Vein Fostering Pill after the battle…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Xiang Yue snorted coldly, “I do not deign to join everyone in attacking a feeble female cultivator. That I can even make a move is already quite good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“As for the Elephant Vein Fostering Pill, I suppose Lord Long would not dare to pin it on me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Xiang Yue possessed a certain arrogance of a strong person; after his first move, he folded his arms and watched the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">However, his single strike directly destroyed the mechanized defense, causing the greatest damage to the mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Although Shuang Ling promptly replenished with new mechanisms, their quality was evidently lacking somewhat, resulting in a drop in her combat power, as she struggled alone against many, falling into a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Unexpectedly, when mechanized arts cultivation reached perfection, its combat power was so terrifying. Indeed, in the realm of cultivation, every art was profound and extensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“Hmph, and not to mention, think of how much wealth she expended. Without the support of a nation, how could she possibly achieve this level on her own?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">It was finally contained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The soldiers of the Thousand Peaks Forest Allied Army, upon witnessing such a battle, secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Previously, the strength displayed by Shuang Ling had imposed a heavy pressure on them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Within the military camps of Two Note Nation, Zhao Xi wore a solemn expression, his heart filled with worry and regret, saying, “Had we not pursued the Heavenly Double Ghosts earlier, we wouldn’t be in such a passive situation now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He instinctively glanced back towards the depths of the camp, where Du Tiechuan’s secluded retreat was located.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Zhao Xi soon turned his head back, observing the battlefield and silently praying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“Princess, you must hold on!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">At present, the only person he could rely on was the formidable Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Just as the high-level cultivators of both armies were fighting fiercely to the death, a calamity was taking place on Qiu Teng Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Gao Cuo disguised his appearance, gazing into the distance at this mountain peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He saw that this Heavenly Pillar Giant Wood Mountain, its body rising in a spiral, had twelve blue-vine waterfalls cascading down in succession, giving it a peculiar appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">On the mountain, there were numerous trees, but even more so, vines were visible everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The twelve blue-vine waterfalls distributed on the mountain were the area where the vines were most concentrated. Based on the height difference of the cliffs, these vines, extending from the roots, were lush green and teeming with vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">By the midsection of the “waterfalls,” they turned from green to yellow, with most of the vitality dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Finally, at the point where they landed, every single vine was withered and shriveled, with countless decayed vine branches and leaves piling together, forming a swamp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">On the surface of the swamp floated patches of bioluminescent fungus mats. Inside the swamp, a massive number of fireflies lived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">From time to time, a streak of ghastly green phosphorescent fire rose from the swamp, filled with the aura of death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">“Vines entwine the bones of heroes, and phosphorescent fire shatters the dream of immortality. This was the cultivation ground of Bi Tengyi.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">“According to rumors, the Ten Thousand Withered Bioluminescent Phosphorus Curse that she cultivated was obtained by comprehending these blue-vine waterfalls.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Gao Cuo sighed inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Old Sword’s voice resonated in his heart: “These blue vine-formed waterfalls indeed have a method. From life to death, they contain natural mysteries.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">However, now was not the time to study this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Bi Tengyi had already been slain, leaving only her Nascent Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">This was her stronghold; after her Nascent Soul traversed the void, it was highly likely to return here, and, taking advantage of the arrangements here, rebuild a body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">“This was exactly our chance to take action!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Gao Cuo nodded slightly, “Indeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">He harbored a fortuitous encounter and had Old Sword as his companion; his cultivation journey was never lonely, and he was deeply plotting for the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Long ago, he had heard that on Qiu Teng Peak there were two treasures of life and death, namely the Blue-Type Vine representing vitality, and the Ying Zang Sha representing death.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
