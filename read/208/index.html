<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 208: Peak of the Ninth Layer!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The reformation team of the City Lord's Mansion had been in seclusion for cultivation for some time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">When the three leaders, Li Duolun, Feng Dao, and Guan Tiesuo, met, they discussed Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The chubby Li Duolun spoke first, "Have you heard? Someone has already matched our record!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The short Feng Feidao nodded, "I know, it's Ning Zhuo from the Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Guan Tiesuo's voice was deep and puzzled, "We have Young Master Meng Chong on our side. What's the situation with the Ning family? How did they do it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Li Duolun explained the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">It turned out that Ning Zhuo had used Five Elements Spells, blasting his way through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Even someone as tough as Guan Tiesuo couldn't help but take a sharp breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He admired, "Impressive!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"We've all cultivated these Five Elements Spells. For Ning Zhuo to rely solely on them to break through to the second gate shows his extraordinary mastery of spells."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Remember, we are ranked on the leaderboard and can regularly draw rewards from the leaderboard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"As long as we choose spells, we can receive guidance and gain casting experience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Even so, none of us have achieved what Ning Zhuo has."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"He has no rewards from the leaderboard and relies entirely on himself. That's truly terrifying!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Feng Feidao crossed his arms and speculated, "How could Ning Zhuo master various Five Elements Spells to such an extent in such a short time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Could it be that he spent all his time practicing spells outside of cultivation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Thinking about it, he must have been stuck at the third layer of Qi Refining for a long time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"But without subsequent techniques, his cultivation couldn't progress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"In such a situation, it's only natural that he would devote all his time and energy to practicing spells."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">But Li Duolun shook his head, "That's just the standard for normal people. From what I know, Ning Zhuo is not a normal person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Li Duolun clearly knew more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He briefly explained Ning Zhuo's deeds to the other two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo controlled the black market and resolved the Ning family's young patriarch issue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo, with the help of three families, was publicly refining a Golden Core Stage mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Although he repeatedly clarified that this time he was only forging the outer shell and skeleton of the mechanical wolf ape, achieving this with his Qi Refining third layer cultivation was remarkable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Now, the Ning family's reformation team was entirely under Ning Zhuo's control, with him making all the decisions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Ning family's main branch genius, Ning Xiaohui, had already been sidelined by him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Young men like him, who climb up from the bottom, are not to be underestimated," Li Duolun highly praised Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The other two fell silent after hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">As pioneers, they felt the pressure of being chased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Feng Feidao sighed, "This Ning Zhuo is indeed no ordinary genius!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"I'm very curious about his talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Guan Tiesuo's eyebrows slightly raised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">With a hint of disbelief, he guessed, "Could he be a celestial talent?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The three exchanged glances and fell silent again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">In the best cultivation chamber of the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Meng Chong looked at the jade slip in his hand, his brows slightly furrowed, and muttered, "Ning Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">For the first time, Meng Chong officially learned Ning Zhuo's name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Hmph."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Trying to catch up to me? You have a long way to go. First, try your best to stand shoulder to shoulder with me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"If you can do that, I'll be very happy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Because the current exploration is somewhat boring."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Meng Chong eagerly awaited the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng to cause him trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He longed for revenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">However, recently, under Ning Zhuo's arrangement, Dasheng had been actively avoiding him, making Meng Chong very uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Putting aside the jade slip, Meng Chong immersed himself in cultivation again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Celestial Talent—WildSprint Thunderclap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In the next moment, countless electric lights surged through his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">With the boost of the electric lights, his cultivation advanced rapidly, improving with every breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Due to frequently using his celestial talent, Meng Chong had become even thinner recently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Now, his cheekbones protruded, and his eye sockets were deep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He had used his celestial talent too frequently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But while he paid the price, he also reaped great rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Currently, his cultivation had reached the late stage of the fifth layer, nearing its peak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">City Lord's Mansion, study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Fei Si was handling official duties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He had started working at dawn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The jade slips he had processed were neatly stacked in a corner of the desk, almost reaching Fei Si's chin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Just as Fei Si was about to take a breath, Xia Qu brought in a new pile of jade slips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Fei Si was already accustomed to this situation and let out a sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Since the recruitment order was issued, the number of affairs he had to handle had increased tenfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Many matters seemed trivial but were actually of great importance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Because many important figures had flocked to Fire Persimmon Immortal City, such as the Golden Core Stage true disciples of the Great Purity Palace and Purple Dawn Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Fei Si had to handle these matters properly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">If not handled well, it could greatly impact the stability of Fire Persimmon Immortal City and Meng Kui's rule.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">At the same time, he had to guard against demonic cultivators from the Soul Devouring Sect and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Not long ago, Luo Shang had fought in a secret underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">During the battle, even a trace of Nascent Soul level aura had erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This situation sounded an alarm for Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After investigating the scene, they also discovered traces of the Void Sect's spellcasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Based on their speculation, at least one Golden Core Stage true disciple of the Void Sect had participated in the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But they still didn't know who it was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The recruitment order had turned Fire Persimmon Immortal City into a vortex, with turbulent currents!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This move by the King of the Southern Bean Kingdom had greatly diverted Xiang Xiao's energy and manpower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Not only Fei Si but even Chi Han was also exhausted recently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Fei Si had thought about recruiting an assistant, but he wasn't satisfied with the candidates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">They either lacked ability or status.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Naturally, Fei Si thought of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Although the latter was only at the third layer of Qi Refining, his cultivation was lacking, but his abilities had long been noticed by Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Fei Si couldn't help but recall the latest intelligence on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He hadn't expected Ning Zhuo to achieve such a feat—matching Meng Chong's record!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Now Ning Zhuo has also obtained the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"But too much is as bad as too little."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Perhaps he doesn't understand this principle, being so young and having achieved so much."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Only after suffering setbacks in this area can one truly understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Young man, you should stop now. If you go further, you'll be in trouble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Fei Si only thought this in his heart and never actually advised Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He admired and had high hopes for Ning Zhuo, seeing him as a younger version of himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He had also suffered from overreaching in the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Now he wanted to see Ning Zhuo suffer the same setback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Fei Si silently waited for the opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He wanted to wait until Ning Zhuo hit rock bottom before stepping in to help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This way, his efforts to win people's hearts would be twice as effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Family Estate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Damn it, damn it!" Ning Xiao'e suddenly opened her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Her aura was boiling like hot water, and her chest heaved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">When she practiced the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, she was always restless and irritable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Comparison only brings harm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Especially after experiencing the great convenience brought by the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, she found it increasingly unbearable to practice slowly now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">She missed the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman dearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">It's easy to go from frugality to luxury, but difficult to go from luxury to frugality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Every time she thought of the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman in Ning Zhuo's hands, she felt extremely uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Her precious talisman was helping her enemy and rival, aiding him in increasing his cultivation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Xiaohui felt very distressed and depressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">She didn't know that after obtaining the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, Ning Zhuo had set it aside and handed it to Sun Lingtong for inspection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">After all, the talisman was taken from Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo couldn't guarantee whether she had tampered with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">What Ning Xiaohui longed for was dispensable to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo didn't care about improving his cultivation; what he lacked was the purification and refinement of his Three Treasures cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">In the cultivation chamber, Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a mat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">He swallowed a Pure One Pill, activated his mana, quickly digesting the pill, and wrapped the medicinal power with his essence blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">His qi and blood circulated throughout his body, integrating the medicinal power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He took out the Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact to purify his mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">At the same time, he used the Clear Source Treasure Mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">This magical artifact, obtained from the Zheng family, was purchased by Ning Zhuo with the proceeds from selling subsequent techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The quality of the magical artifact was very high, and its effect was far superior to the Tornado Windmill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo infused his Three Treasures cultivation into the Clear Source Treasure Mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Then, the Clear Source Treasure Mirror would return the cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The returned cultivation was much purer and more refined than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Throughout Ning Zhuo's cultivation process, the formation in the cultivation chamber was always in effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The formation provided significant assistance to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">This formation was specially crafted for Ning Zhuo by several formation experts from the Zhou family, sent by Zhou Zeshen, and had powerful refining effects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">With all these methods combined, Ning Zhuo's speed of purifying and refining his cultivation became astonishing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The cultivation world had developed to such an extent that the development of most resources was highly efficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Various auxiliary cultivation methods were abundant and highly advanced, affecting all aspects of a cultivator's practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">This unprecedented demand for resources made cultivators' need for resources unprecedentedly huge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">As long as resources were abundant and the methods were appropriate, cultivation could be extremely fast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo relied on his connections and his own skills to utilize the resources of the three major families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Previously, even prodigies like Zheng Jian and Zhou Zeshen found it difficult to achieve what Ning Zhuo had.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace had given each of the three families their own goals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Due to the pressure from the City Lord's Mansion, the three families had to cooperate closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">This provided Ning Zhuo with ample room for growth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">In the past, it was difficult to mobilize the resources of the three families as Ning Zhuo did!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Several days passed quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">In the cultivation chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Zhuo was enveloped in layers of floating clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">He was multitasking, pushing the ninth layer technique, beginning a crucial breakthrough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">In an instant, he broke through from the peak of the eighth layer to the early stage of the ninth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The breakthrough was so natural, without any obstacles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">As Ning Zhuo continued to operate the three techniques simultaneously, his Three Treasures cultivation rapidly soared!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Early stage of the ninth layer...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Mid stage of the ninth layer...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Late stage of the ninth layer...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Peak of the ninth layer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Just as Sun Lingtong had predicted, the dual cultivation of Yin and Yang last time was significant, giving Ning Zhuo a solid foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">When Ning Zhuo purified his eighth layer cultivation to the extreme and broke through, he advanced from the early stage of the ninth layer to the peak of the ninth layer in one go!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Ning Zhuo felt his three dantians finally no longer swollen and uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">He felt a sense of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">"Peak of the ninth layer!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"The speed far exceeded my expectations!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"Next is further purification."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">"And preparing for Foundation Establishment!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Three Dantians Foundation Establishment...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel full of anticipation and excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">In the cultivation world, it was extremely rare to cultivate three different techniques in three dantians simultaneously and then advance to the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Even in major sects like the Soul Devouring Sect and the Void Sect, this was the case.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
