<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The ghost army advanced silently, moving like shadows in the gloom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Within one of the chariots, Sun Lingtong was filled with confusion. “When did I act arrogantly?” he wondered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The mocking voice beside him sneered, “You dared confront Lord Silent right away! You’re lucky he’s generous and broad-minded, choosing not to squabble with a mere Foundation Establishment ghost cultivator like yourself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Lingtong immediately understood his situation. “I see. I deliberately chose this chariot to spy for Little Zhuo, so I purposely provoked them, leaning on Elder Luo Si’s authority. Now I’ve ended up alienating everyone.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Yet his earlier amnesia had undone everything. After intentionally antagonizing Lord Silent and his subordinates, he embarrassingly had to ask them directly about his own provocations. It was absurd - like a clown putting on an unintended performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">But having grown up surviving in rough streets and alleys, Sun Lingtong felt no shame over such trivial humiliation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Being mocked was always better than losing one’s life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Yet, sacrificing his life meant nothing to Sun Lingtong, provided it was for the right person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Little Zhuo, Little Zhuo…” Sun Lingtong secretly called through the Life Hanging by a Thread, but there was no response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">His heart sank immediately. Thinking carefully, he realized, “The water from the Forgetful River couldn’t wipe my memories, yet Luo Si did so effortlessly. His methods are strong enough to suppress even my Void Seal. He’s far more formidable than I expected!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Now I can’t contact Little Zhuo. This ghost army’s march is probably cloaked by powerful concealment techniques, which have also disrupted my communication with Little Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This was perfectly reasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In today’s cultivation world, methods and doctrines blossomed abundantly, and military strategies had reached remarkable sophistication. Concealed marches were the norm, while overtly powerful maneuvers like Iron Torrent Sweeping the Plains were rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Underworld’s prefecture, analogous to powerful cultivation kingdoms in the mortal realm, naturally had elite formations and tactics. If Sun and Ning could so easily breach their secrecy, that would be utterly ridiculous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After all, both of them were merely Foundation Establishment cultivators, far from capable of miraculous feats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In mere breaths, Sun Lingtong’s mind flashed through countless deductions and reached complete clarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Chuckling coldly, he provoked again, “You’re laughing so nicely now. I hope you’ll still laugh like this later. This raid into the city - can you all really make it back?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“You’re all walking dead, so I won’t hold grudges!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Even if he’d gathered some intelligence before, he’d forgotten it now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Likely, he’d gleaned nothing anyway. He’d scanned his body carefully with divine sense but found no jade slips or similar recording devices.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">To gather intelligence once again, Sun Lingtong boldly antagonized six Golden Core cultivators simultaneously, despite being only at Foundation Establishment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Of course, it wasn’t reckless bravado.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Observing outside the chariot, Sun Lingtong noted the impeccable discipline and rigid order of the ghost troops - undoubtedly elite soldiers from the Underworld Prefecture of Forgetful River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Just as one should exploit a gentleman’s righteousness, Sun Lingtong inferred that internal conflict would be harshly penalized, especially with battle imminent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">As expected, three Golden Core ghost generals reacted instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Among them, one ghost general with a bone club roared, “Insolent dog! Just a puny Foundation Establishment cultivator, yet so arrogant!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He brandished the bone club towards Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Bang! Bang! Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Three muted impacts echoed, forcing Sun Lingtong onto his knees inside the chariot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He tried to struggle but couldn’t move, every joint blazing with pain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The bone-club ghost general sneered cruelly, “My bone club specializes in striking joints. Little Foundation Establishment cultivator, does it hurt?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“If it hurts…” He pointed the club again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Bang! Bang! Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Three more strikes hit him. Sun Lingtong gasped in agony, his breathing labored, the pain drilling down to his bones, nearly knocking him unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Yet Sun Lingtong stubbornly refused to groan in pain. Instead, he glared defiantly, shouting, “Come on! Beat me to death if you dare!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The bone-club ghost general lifted his club high in rage, only to be stopped by the Crimson-haired Ghost General beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Laughing loudly, the Crimson-haired Ghost General teased, “Old Bones, I know you intended good for this junior, loosening his joints a bit. But look, your kindness backfired - he doesn’t appreciate it at all!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Take a good look at my technique!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">As he spoke, the Crimson-haired Ghost General blew out a stream of fiery breath, engulfing Sun Lingtong entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The ghostly flames penetrated straight into Sun Lingtong’s very soul, scorching him from within. Agony seized every fiber of his being, causing him to tremble violently, yet he gritted his teeth and endured without uttering a sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Crimson-haired Ghost General squinted, a cruel smile spreading across his lips. “Does it feel good? My Underworld Ghost Flames can directly burn the soul, bringing you some warmth, eh?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Following him, the Green-faced Ghost General unleashed another sinister move. Patches of corpse moss began sprouting across Sun Lingtong’s tortured body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">A third wave of pain crashed over Sun Lingtong, breaking through his threshold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Unable to withstand any longer, Sun Lingtong desperately activated the Void Seal hidden deep within his soul, channeling all the overwhelming pain into the seal, where it gradually dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Although the torment remained immense and overwhelming, having an outlet significantly reduced the agony, allowing Sun Lingtong to hold on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Witnessing him endure silently without even a whimper, the attacking Ghost Generals exchanged embarrassed glances, their faces darkening with displeasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Just as a fourth Ghost General was about to step forward, the Silent Ghost General slowly raised his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Silent Ghost General was the undisputed leader of this mission. Although all present were Golden Core-level, his strength and prestige far surpassed the rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">With just one gesture, the other Ghost Generals immediately ceased their torture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Relieved from the torment, Sun Lingtong took in a shuddering breath, nearly collapsing unconscious from the sudden release of intense pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Completely drained and battered, Sun Lingtong lay motionless on the floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Silent Ghost General stared down at him silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Nearby, the Flower Life Ghost General, wearing a white paper flower atop his head, spoke for the Silent Ghost General, “Little Foundation Establishment cultivator, my lord wishes to know, how do you feel now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“You should realize that despite all we’ve done, not a single sound escaped outside this carriage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“This is precisely my lord’s power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“With such methods, even if we assaulted White Paper City for half an hour, none might even notice.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Do you still believe we’re marching to our deaths?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong wished to retort, yet he lacked even the strength to roll his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Those mere dozen breaths felt like years to him; the torment was intense, the price for his insolence exacted fully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yet, he had gambled correctly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">These Golden Core Ghost Generals clearly had the strength to crush him instantly but restrained themselves, unwilling to breach military discipline over a trivial Foundation Establishment cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The ghostly army soon crossed the boundary between yin and yang, finally reaching the Ghostly Black Marshlands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Six Golden Core Ghost Generals silently departed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Weak and weary, Sun Lingtong staggered off the carriage to regroup with the main army, awaiting orders to assault the city walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">During this period, he repeatedly tried contacting Ning Zhuo, growing anxious from failed attempts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Fortunately, the order soon came, and the ghost army charged toward the North Gate of White Paper City. With concealment unnecessary during battle maneuvers, Sun Lingtong finally reached Ning Zhuo, quickly relaying all gathered intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo, having grown equally anxious at the silence, responded with relief and determination, “Don’t worry, brother. I’ve already requested reinforcements, and everything is prepared.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong chuckled bitterly, “Give them a good fight - make sure those six Ghost Generals suffer!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Understanding his brother’s anger well, Ning Zhuo’s gaze sharpened. He clenched his teeth, replying resolutely, “Understood.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Meanwhile, in an alley near White Paper City’s southern gate,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Flower Life Ghost General, whose ears had bloomed into flowers, listened intently. “Battle at the North Gate is fierce. Our forces immediately deployed war chariots upon engagement.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Silent Ghost General nodded, raised his hand, and took the lead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The other five swiftly followed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Amplifying his natural talent to the maximum, the Silent Ghost General encompassed everyone around him, enabling them to run at full speed, breaking through walls without causing any noise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">They made a beeline toward the paper statue near the southern gate, prepared to destroy the giant paper construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Just as they were about to strike, a youthful voice suddenly rang out, “Activate the formation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Instantly, twenty-eight luminous musical script arrays surfaced on the ground, revealing twelve gleaming Blue Underworld Jade Marrow Nails hidden deep underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Four robust bronze pillars emerged, topped by statues of Azure Phoenixes with golden strings clutched in their beaks, each dangling seven exquisite bells. Tiny runes densely covered the bells - astonishingly, each bell bore the entire “Profound Cave Spirit Tone Ghoul-Exterminating Spell” meticulously engraved upon it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Six Golden Core ghost generals charged straight into the towering paper giant, willingly plunging into the heart of the formation. In the blink of an eye, they found themselves trapped within its mystical space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">As they glanced around anxiously, they saw a crystal-blue sky stretched over a lustrous jade landscape. Four imposing bronze pillars rose from the ground, marking the cardinal directions, around which countless azure birds circled gracefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">On the horizon stood an enormous, upright humanoid mountain, its peak shrouded in dense clouds that replaced its head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Damn it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“This is a trap!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Panic rippled among the ghost generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Silent Ghost General raised one hand calmly, prompting Flower Life Ghost General to quickly interpret his gesture: “Leader Silent says to remain calm. Didn’t we anticipate their deployment of formations here after our previous setback?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The reassurance quickly calmed the generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Leader Silent is right.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Every formation has a weakness. What’s there to panic about?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“Let’s probe first and see exactly what kind of formation this is!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The ghost generals cautiously tested the formation. Instead of immediately attacking the prominent bronze pillars, they aimed for the mountainous giant directly ahead. Yet, no matter how far they ran, the giant remained distant, unmoving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">One general even tried retreating, hoping to exploit the space, only to find upon turning around that the colossal mountain now loomed behind him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Realization dawned swiftly. “This formation distorts space! We can’t break through by mere running!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Several desperate attempts followed, utilizing powerful artifacts and techniques. However, the sky remained impenetrable, and the jade ground unyielding, showing no signs of weakening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With no alternatives left, they reluctantly directed their attacks against the four bronze pillars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Fierce battles erupted around the pillars, as azure birds launched themselves ferociously against the attackers. Under enormous pressure to finish quickly, the generals unleashed relentless, heavy blows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Soon, most of the bronze birds fell, and the pillars trembled under the onslaught.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Flower Life Ghost General shouted excitedly, “I’ve figured it out! These pillars are the formation cores. Destroy them, and the heart of the formation will appear!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">At the heart of the formation, Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged, carefully controlling its operations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Suddenly, two Golden Core ghost generals appeared behind him - Silent Ghost General leading the ambush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">They struck with full force, instantly reducing Ning Zhuo to countless fragments of paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“It’s fake!” Both ghost generals felt their hearts sink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“They’re illusions!” Hidden in shadows, Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu realized simultaneously. They saw through the enemy’s clever ruse - Silent Ghost General and his companion in the center were merely decoys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This squad of Golden Core ghost generals exhibited impressive tactical discipline. They had identified the true core - the mountainous giant - and the pillars as mere nodes. Their earlier actions were all deceptive maneuvers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Yet Ning Zhuo had anticipated this. The “Ning Zhuo” at the formation’s core was merely Wen Ruanyu’s painted decoy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“Truly impressive, this Silent Talent,” Ning Zhuo praised internally. He understood clearly that another ghost general executed the actual attack, but it was Silent Ghost General’s innate ability that enabled the successful deception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“Senior Wen, it’s time,” Ning Zhuo prompted softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The true master of the formation was Wen Ruanyu. He immediately infused spiritual energy into the formation, activating the jade chime protecting the core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The jade chime resonated deeply, releasing waves of pale green sonic ripples that swiftly enveloped the entire formation space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Every ghost general’s energy instantly churned like boiling water, glowing faintly green, forcing them into semi-transparency. Though their spiritual energies remained functional, Silent Ghost General’s heart sank as dread filled him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">To his horror, his innate silent talent had been thoroughly countered. It might function outside, but inside the formation, his stealth was utterly neutralized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Now, their only choice was brute force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Wen Ruanyu smiled coldly and activated the formation’s second stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The tiny golden bells hanging from the azure birds began ringing incessantly, creating a cascade of sharp, intense notes, reminiscent of a torrential downpour.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Empowered by resonant bell tones, the four bronze pillars emanated radiant bronze light, rapidly repairing themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Caught in the deafening sounds, the ghost generals felt their senses utterly disrupted. They heard the thunder of countless warhorses, saw countless overlapping azure bird illusions, and struggled heavily to command their energy, which now flowed sluggishly like mud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“This is the Jade Chime True Sound Formation!” They finally grasped the true identity of the array from its dual capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“Watch your feet!” one general urgently shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">But the warning was too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Wen Ruanyu triggered the formation’s third stage. Twelve jade marrow nails embedded in the formation’s foundation unleashed the Jade Fault Thunder Technique, striking directly through the ghost generals’ soles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Several ghost generals were instantly maimed, their legs shattered and bodies collapsing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“Retreat, retreat now!” a ghost general shrieked in desperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">But isolated within the formation space, escape was nothing more than an impossible dream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
