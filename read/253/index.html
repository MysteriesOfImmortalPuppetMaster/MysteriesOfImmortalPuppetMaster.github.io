<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 253: Rudie Niang</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">After a brief exchange due to limited time, Sun Lingtong began to hand over to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He first took out a slender jade bottle and handed it over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo accepted it, uncorked the bottle, and glanced inside, his face immediately lighting up with joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This was Supreme virtuous water, a treasure of the water element!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Three drops are enough to cleanse all the surveillance methods on me," Ning Zhuo murmured softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sun Lingtong advised him, "When to cleanse the surveillance is something that needs careful consideration. You can't be too reckless or optimistic. Even though you have means to conceal yourself from Zhu Xuanji's detection, preventing your true cultivation from being exposed, once you remove the surveillance, Golden Core cultivators will definitely swarm to investigate and question you. You need to think about how to explain this matter!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"I'm more worried that they might become suspicious and secretly apply more surveillance methods on you. In that case, your efforts would be in vain. There won't be another three drops of Supreme virtuous water available for you. So, choosing when to use these three drops is crucial and requires utmost caution!" Ning Zhuo nodded heavily, "I understand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Next, Sun Lingtong handed over some Thunder Beetles, Mist Rust Orchids, Heavenly Dew, and premium Cloud Tea to Ning Zhuo. "You might need these materials to create mechanical constructs while wandering in the Lava Immortal Palace, so I'm giving you some in advance." Ning Zhuo couldn't help but show a look of greed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He hadn't expected Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu's theft to yield such a bounty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"It seems that Song Fuli and his Cloud Merchants aren't that formidable after all, losing so much... Or perhaps Yang Chanyu played a crucial role in this," Ning Zhuo speculated silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He knew Sun Lingtong well, understanding his limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Over the years, he had personally assisted and even saved Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"If my guess is correct, it's no wonder Brother Sun sought Yang Chanyu's help," Ning Zhuo realized the significance of Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He thought for a moment and then praised Yang Chanyu with a few words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Yang Chanyu squinted her eyes, scrutinizing his face, "Little brother, you sure know how to talk sweetly. But sweet talk alone is useless!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"This time, Brother Sun and I risked our lives to steal from within the Cloud Whale. You stayed in the rear, taking no risks, yet you get such a large share. Hehe, I hope you'll perform well in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"If you don't show your worth and make me feel you're not deserving of such a share, I won't let you off!" Yang Chanyu warned Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong chuckled, interrupting Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo quickly assured that he would do his utmost to prove his value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Finally, Sun Lingtong took out the mechanical puppet Rudie Niang, "Little brother, look what I've brought for you. You'll definitely like this!" Ning Zhuo was initially stunned upon seeing Rudie Niang, then his eyes widened, sparkling with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"What kind of mechanical puppet is this?" Ning Zhuo couldn't help but get excited. "Quick, put her down so I can take a good look!" Ning Zhuo's reaction was just as Sun Lingtong had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Whenever Ning Zhuo saw exquisite mechanical constructs, he would react with genuine excitement and joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Sun Lingtong, with a grin, placed Rudie Niang on the long medical table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Rudie Niang remained motionless, eyes closed, in a dormant state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo approached the table, reaching out to touch her long skirt and inspect her jade belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Rudie Niang's long skirt and jade belt were both artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The skirt had some defensive capabilities, while the jade belt was for storage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong timely explained, "Her waist and jade bottle both have storage capabilities, but I've checked, and there's nothing inside. The jade bottle's function, which I've researched, is specifically for collecting sky clouds, with little offensive capability."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, speculating, "Could this mechanical puppet's purpose be similar to my Mechanical Fire Monkey, specifically designed to harvest certain cultivation resources?" Ning Zhuo continued his inspection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">His gaze paused at the top of Rudie Niang's head, where there was a butterfly-shaped silver crown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The silver crown was adorned with tiny jewels, sparkling from every angle, quite dazzling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"What is this silver crown for?" Ning Zhuo inquired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Sun Lingtong replied, "I haven't studied it in detail. So far, I've only explored her silk clothes, belt, and jade bottle." Immediately, Ning Zhuo focused his thoughts, pressing on the surgical table and channeling mana into a talisman on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The table glowed, revealing numerous mechanical tools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">These tools emerged from the table and floated in mid-air, surrounding Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">With just a thought, these tools would automatically fly into his hands, making it very convenient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">They were currently in the intensive care room, the highest-grade treatment area in the Medical Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo selected a tool from the many available and placed it above the silver crown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">After activating the tool and conducting a brief examination, he obtained preliminary results. "This silver crown can be used for reconnaissance and also has control capabilities, but what it controls is still unclear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo didn't delve further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">His gaze shifted downwards, quickly scanning Rudie Niang's entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He reached out, grasping Rudie Niang's delicate hand, examining it, and gently pinching her arm. "Her skin is made from a composite material, with high cloud cotton as the main component."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"This material's characteristic is its ability to automatically absorb spiritual energy from the air, and it's as soft and elastic as a cloud." Ning Zhuo opened a lamp-like mechanical tool, shining it on Rudie Niang's arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The light revealed previously unseen details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Beneath Rudie Niang's skin, a layer of extremely fine silver array patterns was faintly visible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">These silver patterns interwove, forming dense mesh-like structures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo pondered for a while, murmuring, "Her entire skin can automatically gather external spiritual energy. This design indicates that this mechanical construct has a high demand for spiritual energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"The skin appears soft and fragile, but it's not. Beneath the surface, there's a defensive array specifically arranged. The array master's technique is extremely advanced. I can see the array patterns but can't deduce the array's core."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"This array technique is at least at the master level, allowing for relative changes in the array's base and core, transforming the entire array. Here, the array was specifically altered for Rudie Niang's form."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"I can only discern that when she truly fights, this array will activate, forming a protective spiritual light, providing comprehensive defense." After examining the skin, Ning Zhuo began investigating Rudie Niang's hands and feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Although Rudie Niang resembled a living person, her body temperature was low, feeling cold to the touch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He discovered that Rudie Niang's hands and feet were very flexible, intricately constructed, resembling human hands and feet but scaled down several times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Mechanical Fire Monkey's hands could also perform delicate actions, with several nested arrays arranged by Ning Zhuo to facilitate harvesting Fire Persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">However, compared to Rudie Niang's hands, the difference was stark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">After a rough inspection, Ning Zhuo donned a headband.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The tools provided by the Medical Pavilion were of excellent quality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">With the headband on, Ning Zhuo's spiritual sense could intertwine, forming a temporary divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">His temporary divine sense enveloped Rudie Niang, penetrating her entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The next moment, a faint white light emanated from Rudie Niang, enveloping her completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu's expressions tensed, quickly becoming vigilant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo's brow furrowed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He hadn't expected that just a slight probe with his divine sense would trigger Rudie Niang's protective spiritual light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Although he couldn't determine her defensive strength, it was clear that her defense was highly sensitive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Most of Ning Zhuo's divine sense was blocked, allowing him to barely see some parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">For instance, he found that Rudie Niang's hands lacked overlapping arrays and didn't have the bone structure of human hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Instead, they were supported by a network of fine threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Rudie Niang's feet had a similar structure, but each sole contained a talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">These two talismans were identical, and Ning Zhuo couldn't fully understand them, only recognizing them as some form of martial art talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This piqued his curiosity: when Rudie Niang used the talisman, what kind of abilities would manifest? Through his temporary divine sense, Ning Zhuo also discovered that Rudie Niang's body contained "blood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Her blood was milky white, semi-transparent, reminiscent of high-quality stalactites.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, and with a thought, a fine hollow needle flew into his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He inserted the needle into Rudie Niang's arm vein.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The next moment, the protective spiritual light surged, snapping the hollow needle and expelling it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">However, in that brief time, Ning Zhuo achieved his goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He collected Rudie Niang's milky white blood from the broken needle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">After testing, Ning Zhuo confirmed that it was a composite material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The liquid was rich in life force, providing strong repair capabilities for her skin, bones, and other mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Moreover, this liquid could carry a considerable amount of mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Its capacity was so strong that it could rival top-grade blank spirit stones! Clearly, this was a result deliberately pursued by the designer of her mechanical structure.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
