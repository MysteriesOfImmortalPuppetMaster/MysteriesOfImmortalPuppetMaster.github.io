<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">To rent a cave abode, one had to go to the Hall of Internal Affairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo already had an acquaintance there: Cao Gui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He had previously collaborated with Cao Gui to deal with Yu Heye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">After some deliberation, Ning Zhuo decided to seek him out again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">When Cao Gui saw Ning Zhuo, he narrowed his eyes and asked directly, "Fellow Daoist Ning, are you friend or foe?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo smiled. "Naturally, we are allies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Cao Gui shook his head. "If that's the case, why have you repeatedly accepted Yu Heye's invitations to banquets?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Yu Heye had offended the Cao Clan years ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">As a member of the Cao Clan, one of Cao Gui's reasons for agreeing to cooperate with Ning Zhuo was to make trouble for Yu Heye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Another reason was Cao Gui's relative poverty; Ning Zhuo's offered compensation was substantial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in a respectful bow and said sincerely, "My conflict with Yu Heye was merely a minor misunderstanding, now resolved. As a newcomer, making peace with a Golden Core cultivator is the proper course of action."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"I believe this shouldn't affect our friendship, Fellow Daoist Cao Gui."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"After all, the Cao Clan is the Cao Clan, and you are you. Given your current circumstances, how much support does your family truly provide?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Cao Gui sighed deeply. "Though I'm considered an outsider in the clan, I secured this position through family connections."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"How could I forget my roots?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">With that, he waved his sleeve. "I understand your choice, Fellow Daoist Ning. From now on, we shall be strangers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, clasped his hands in a formal salute, and said, "Fellow Daoist, your righteousness is admirable. It is my misfortune that I am unworthy of being your friend. Farewell!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Cao Gui watched Ning Zhuo depart before turning back to his work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo rode a cloud away from the Hall of Internal Affairs to another location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">His expression remained impassive. Cao Gui's change in attitude was one of the scenarios he had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Originally, Ning Zhuo's plan had been to use the opportunity of dealing with Yu Heye to cultivate closer ties with the Cao Clan. Despite their decline, the Cao Clan remained a significant power among the old Four Peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">But then an unexpected event occurred: Yu Heye voluntarily submitted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">As a Golden Core cultivator, his submission carried far greater value, and Ning Zhuo naturally chose the latter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">This meant the breakdown of his relationship with Cao Gui. Today's meeting confirmed this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Becoming strangers... this outcome is neither good nor bad."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">At least they hadn't become enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Having confirmed this new dynamic, Ning Zhuo put the Cao Clan matter out of his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">It's impossible to please everyone. In other words, maintaining good relations with every faction and individual is impossible, especially in a competitive environment where one must vie for cultivation resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Between the Cao Clan and Yu Heye, Ning Zhuo had chosen the latter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Between Shen Xi and Pi Fujie, Ning Zhuo chose the former.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">When the time came, he had to pick a side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In politics, neutrality was often the most dangerous position. Loyalty that wasn't absolute was considered absolute disloyalty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Only by aligning himself with a faction could he deepen his relationships.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo's political acumen was more than sufficient for this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Half an hour later, Ning Zhuo stood inside the Azure Stone Cave Mansion, his newly rented abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The cave mansion comprised five rooms and a main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The moss-covered stone hall served as a reception area. The cultivation chamber was paved with azure jade bricks engraved with a Qi Gathering Formation. The Pill and Artifact Chamber featured an Earthfire Formation, sufficient for basic alchemy and artifact crafting. The two living quarters were sparsely furnished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The final room was the Martial Training Chamber, equipped with a Martial Training Formation - the primary reason Ning Zhuo had chosen this cave mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His affairs at the Jade Cleansing Pavilion were settled, leaving only the Luoshu Page unresolved - a task that would take time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Moreover, Yu Heye had become a hidden asset for Ning Zhuo. Lingering there would only draw unwanted attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Having recently made an enemy of Pi Fujie, Ning Zhuo knew he would inevitably make more. Withdrawing now was the wisest course.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Gongsun Yan's arrival made the original cave abode too cramped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo assigned the two living quarters in the Azure Stone Cave Mansion to Old Chef and Qing Chi, respectively. The rooms were virtually empty, allowing them to furnish them as they pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As for Gongsun Yan, he would reside in the Pill and Artifact Chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo didn't even have his own living quarters; the Martial Training Chamber would have to suffice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">His requirements in this regard were minimal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After settling the arrangements, Ning Zhuo activated the Formation within the Martial Training Chamber and entered the Formation Space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Martial Arts Hall's fees were actually quite reasonable, but Ning Zhuo dared not risk exposing Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Within the Formation Space, he unleashed several rounds of Five Elements Spells, causing ripples to spread across the transparent barrier of the Formation Space, effectively probing its defensive strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Instead of immediately releasing Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, Ning Zhuo left the Azure Stone Cave Mansion alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He returned to Yu Heye's mountain peak and, using the mountain's teleportation stone chamber, conducted a secret exchange with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Sun Lingtong returned to the Azure Stone Cave Mansion, while Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged before the Water Vortex Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">During this time, Sun Lingtong had made significant progress in his research of the Water Vortex Formation. He had constructed a small auxiliary Formation outside the main one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Through this auxiliary Formation, Ning Zhuo could now communicate with the core of the Water Vortex Formation - the Luoshu Page. This spared Sun Lingtong from having to constantly rely on his Innate Talent, which was exhausting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">By using the auxiliary Formation, Ning Zhuo was influenced by the Dao Artifact. Through the Life Hanging by a Thread technique, Sun Lingtong also managed to tap into the Luoshu Page's influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Carrying this influence, Sun Lingtong meticulously inspected the Azure Stone Cave Mansion's Formations, confirming their security before quietly departing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Throughout the entire process, Old Chef, Qing Chi, and Gongsun Yan remained completely unaware.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">There was no need to inform them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sun Lingtong's mastery of formations far surpassed Ning Zhuo's. Moreover, with the aid of the Luoshu Page, the results of this inspection were highly likely to be accurate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Crucially, the Mechanism Ring had shown no reaction when Ning Zhuo chose this cave abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Cave abodes of this caliber typically catered to wealthy Foundation Establishment cultivators, a demographic abundant within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Unless Ning Zhuo was extraordinarily unlucky and had chosen one exceptional cave abode out of millions, why would anyone specifically target him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">But when it came to luck, Ning Zhuo was no slouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After the White Paper Immortal City incident, he had earned the favor of Yang Heaven, ensuring his fortune would never be poor. However, at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main headquarters, this Qi Luck manifested less conspicuously. Every super-faction possessed unique treasures to suppress and regulate Qi Luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Considering all these factors, Ning Zhuo was virtually certain the Azure Stone Cave Mansion was safe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Only after secretly exchanging information with Sun Lingtong did he retrieve Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom from within the Martial Training Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Using the Life Hanging by a Thread technique, he covertly established a connection with the Mechanical Puppet. Concealing his own form, he then unleashed a swarm of Mechanism Beasts to besiege Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Snow-Colored Maiden Hui found herself surrounded by Mechanism Beasts, but she retaliated fiercely, tearing wave after wave of the mechanical creatures to shreds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">During each battle, Ning Zhuo deliberately left openings, allowing Snow-Colored Maiden Hui moments to rest. After all, her spiritual energy was the primary driver of the Puppet, and controlling it consumed her reserves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After each victory, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui would tilt her head slightly upward, standing proudly amidst the wreckage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Through Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo could clearly sense her spiritual energy naturally expressing emotions with each triumph. His connection to Snow-Colored Maiden Hui grew increasingly clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"My guess must be correct," he mused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's defining trait is pride."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"By continuously satisfying this aspect of her nature, I can help her express her emotions and accelerate her passage through the Spirit Activation Stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But the good times wouldn't last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">As Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's victories mounted, the pride she derived from each battle diminished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Even when Ning Zhuo deliberately increased the difficulty - by deploying more ordinary Mechanism Beasts or enhancing his control over them - the pride she expressed after each victory noticeably waned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">When the returns dwindled to a certain point, Ning Zhuo decisively halted the exercise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"The joy derived from repeating the same task inevitably diminishes. Even ordinary people would grow numb after doing something too many times."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Then it's time to switch to something else."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo, well-acquainted with Ning Xiaohui, naturally associated this with talisman crafting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">During her lifetime, Ning Xiaohui had been remarkably skilled in talisman crafting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo summoned Qing Chi to the Martial Training Chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">This time, he manifested himself and instructed Qing Chi and Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom to sit cross-legged before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Qing Chi first observed the Mechanical Puppet with curiosity, marveling at her beauty, before her gaze fixed on Ning Zhuo. Even with her memory loss, a deep sense of attachment was evident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Qing Chi always responded enthusiastically to Ning Zhuo's summons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo said, "Today, I've called you here to teach you the fundamentals of talisman crafting. Watch closely!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">With that, Ning Zhuo demonstrated by crafting a Light Body Talisman right before them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The talisman's effect was to reduce the target's weight. When affixed to a mortal and activated, it allowed them to tread snow without leaving a trace and dart across grass with lightning speed, instantly transforming them into masters of light body techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After demonstrating once, Ning Zhuo instructed Qing Chi and Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom to attempt crafting the talisman themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Qing Chi blushed, realizing she had been too absorbed in gazing at Ning Zhuo's face to clearly observe the crafting process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">In contrast, Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom, whose spiritual energy originated from Ning Xiaohui, was utterly captivated by Ning Zhuo's demonstration. She stared intently at his every movement, motionless and completely focused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo instructed both women to begin their attempts at talisman crafting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Snow-Colored Maiden Hui remained motionless for a long while before finally beginning. Her movements were stiff and mechanical, and she quickly failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Failing to create a talisman could result in minor consequences like draining spiritual energy and mental focus, or severe repercussions like backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Fortunately, the Light Body Talisman was a low-level, simple technique. Both Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Qing Chi possessed sufficient reserves to withstand the negative effects of repeated failures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">After each failure, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui endured the consequences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Qing Chi faced similar setbacks, but her movements grew increasingly swift, her progress rapid, and her success drew ever closer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo was secretly astonished. "When I first learned this talisman, my progress was even slower than hers. I never imagined she had such innate talent in this Cultivation art!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">He glanced at Snow-Colored Maiden Hui. Connected by Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo could clearly sense her growing anxiety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Clearly, she was deeply interested in talisman creation and had noticed Qing Chi's rapid progress. She refused to be outdone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Turning his gaze to Qing Chi, Ning Zhuo saw her brow furrowed in concentration, her expression utterly focused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Even without the Life Hanging by a Thread connection, he could easily guess her thoughts: "I must give this my all! If I can't even surpass a Mechanical Puppet, Young Master Ning Zhuo will surely be deeply disappointed in me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly. "I'm sorry, Qing Chi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He used Life Hanging by a Thread to connect with Qing Chi, subtly influencing her fingertips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Qing Chi was crafting a talisman when her movements suddenly distorted, drawing an absurdly curved line that immediately ruined her work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Her brow furrowed deeply. Assuming her technique was flawed, she immediately started again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">With Ning Zhuo's deliberate interference, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui gradually surpassed Qing Chi's progress and ultimately completed her talisman first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">She threw her head back, her posture even more exaggerated than when she had defeated the tiger demon!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo felt a surge of satisfaction. Through Life Hanging by a Thread, he could sense Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom's overwhelming pride, the strongest he had ever witnessed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"This path is the right one!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Qing Chi, on the other hand, was on the verge of tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Why am I so useless? Every time it matters, my fingers betray me, twisting into these distorted movements!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">I can't even beat a Mechanical Puppet! How can I bear this humiliation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">As for why the Mechanical Puppet moved with such agility, Qing Chi, having lost her memories and lacking common sense, didn't find it strange at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo nodded, praising Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom, which triggered another wave of her smug pride. Then, he comforted and encouraged Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The young girl bit her tiger tooth, deeply moved, and vowed to work even harder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo then instructed both sides to compete again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">This time, Qing Chi poured all her effort into the task, and Ning Zhuo refrained from interfering. As expected, she made significant progress. However, just as she was halfway through crafting her talisman, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui successfully completed another one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Since it's a mechanism, does that mean once it's made successfully once, every subsequent attempt will succeed?" Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with insight as he keenly observed that Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's talisman-crafting motions were identical to her previous attempts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin didn't count as his creation, but Ning Zhuo had crafted the Puppet bodies for Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu. However, both of those were combat-oriented, and he hadn't taught them any cultivation techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's situation was entirely new to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">He felt he had guessed the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Next, he began experimenting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Sure enough, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui successfully crafted a talisman every time, her movements perfectly consistent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">With Ning Zhuo's covert interference removed, Qing Chi's speed also increased rapidly after crafting her first Light Body Talisman. Given the talisman's basic and simple nature, she never failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Yet each time, she still couldn't surpass Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Once Little Hui masters talisman crafting, her speed will naturally be the fastest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Qing Chi's potential is far from exhausted. If they compete another ten times, her speed will likely surpass Little Hui's."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Each successful talisman creation fills her with far greater pride than any battle against a Mechanical Beast."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"It seems Snow-Colored Maiden Hui has inherited some of Ning Xiaohui's traits from her past life. She's more inclined toward talisman crafting than combat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">With this realization, Ning Zhuo immediately reclassified the Mechanical Puppet from a combat-oriented model to a production-oriented one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"She should still possess some combat capabilities to fill the power gap while Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu are repairing the Void."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"But in truth, she's better suited for crafting talismans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Once her spiritual energy matures, I should equip her with a Cultivation Art specifically for talisman creation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"Of course, before that, I'll have her try all the Hundred Crafts of Cultivation to fully assess her true potential."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo had a strong feeling that talisman crafting was Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's true calling. But to be certain, he still needed to test her in all the Cultivation arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Seeing Qing Chi about to surpass Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, Ning Zhuo decisively announced, "Alright, next I'll teach you the second type of talisman."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Qing Chi let out a small sound of disappointment, but Ning Zhuo had already begun demonstrating. She had no choice but to set aside her regret and focus on observing intently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Having learned from her previous mistakes, Qing Chi observed this time with meticulous care.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Yet when she tried crafting the talisman herself, she still made frequent errors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"What am I doing wrong?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"It shouldn't be this difficult! Why am I so nervous?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"Am I... trying too hard to impress the Young Master?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Qing Chi grew increasingly anxious, and her doubts began to surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Meanwhile, Snow-Colored Maiden - Wisdom's learning progress naturally lagged far behind Qing Chi's. After all, she was still at the Life Spirit Stage, not yet having advanced to the Wisdom Spirit Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Ning Zhuo wouldn't let Qing Chi's doubts fester. He decisively rose, approached her, and took her hand. "Let me help you. Don't be nervous. Try to keep your fingers steady and avoid trembling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Qing Chi felt as if she could hear the sound of hot steam rushing from the top of her head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">In that moment, she felt like she was about to explode, her heart pounding wildly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">She stared blankly at Ning Zhuo's hand, which was holding hers, feeling as if she had fallen into a beautiful dream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Ning Zhuo patiently guided her, explaining her mistakes with meticulous care, even more patiently than he would teach a young child.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo secretly observed Snow Maiden Hui, noting her progress as she repeatedly failed but gradually improved. He nodded in approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Qing Chi's expression stiffened, her entire body tensing. Her heart was no longer focused on crafting the talisman but remained fixed on Ning Zhuo, constantly sensing the warmth of his palm against hers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">She lost all track of time, feeling as if everything was indescribably wonderful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">It wasn't until Snow Maiden Hui successfully crafted another talisman and Ning Zhuo released her hand that Qing Chi snapped back to reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">The Mechanical Puppet tilted its head back again, this time with an even greater arc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">The reason was simple: despite receiving more guidance, her opponent had still lost to her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">A wave of intense pride washed over her, radiating from her expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Ning Zhuo then instructed them to craft the second type of talisman, and Qing Chi quickly caught up again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">Awakened from her shock, Qing Chi began to focus all her energy and effort on creating talismans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Yi Fu, relying on her talent, which surpassed even Ning Zhuo's, achieved a perfect success rate after her first successful talisman, and her speed continued to increase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">But just as she showed signs of surpassing Snow Maiden Hui again, Ning Zhuo decisively began teaching them both a third type of talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">After demonstrating once, Ning Zhuo instructed them to try it themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">Qing Chi's first stroke went crooked!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">Overwhelmed with embarrassment, she mustered her courage and looked at Ning Zhuo with longing and anticipation. "Young Master, my talent for talisman creation is too poor. Please help me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">Ning Zhuo: ......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">This time, he hadn't used Life Hanging by a Thread to influence her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly, feigning ignorance, and once again guided Qing Chi's hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">In this way, all three parties achieved their goals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">After most of the day had passed, Snow Maiden Hui still needed to continuously vent her emotions and hadn't directly advanced past the Spirit Transformation Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">Comparing her to Yuan Dasheng, Ning Zhuo secretly speculated, "Yuan Dasheng previously broke free from control and acted independently, venting his emotions with extreme intensity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">"Ning Xiaohui, however, is different. Her pride flows like a steady stream. Perhaps this determines that her progress will be a slow and steady grind."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
