<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo's monotonous and repressed life began to become colorful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">With the increasing number of thefts, Sun Lingtong was very satisfied with Ning Zhuo's progress. "Little Zhuo, you learn everything so quickly, you truly have great potential. Why don't you join me and become a member of the Void Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo showed a troubled expression. "Although the Void Sect is your sect, Brother Sun, its reputation is not good. I just want to rob the rich to help the poor and uphold justice, not become a real thief. Ah, Brother Sun, I didn't mean you. You're different from the others, truly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Alright, alright," Sun Lingtong waved his hand repeatedly. "I was just saying. If you don't want to, then forget it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"You just said you want to rob the rich to help the poor. Let's do something more exciting. Hehe!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo was curious. "What's more exciting?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Robbery!" Sun Lingtong's eyes sparkled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In a small alley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong suddenly jumped out, surrounding a ruffian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Robbery!" Sun Lingtong shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Mm-hmm." Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">It was his first time robbing someone, and he was a bit nervous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The ruffian was initially startled, then burst into laughter. "You two kids want to rob me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sun Lingtong became angry. "How dare you look down on me? Little Zhuo, get him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Mm!" Ning Zhuo charged forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He was a Qi Refining cultivator with only the first level of cultivation, while the ruffian was a martial artist who had mastered internal energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The two fought evenly, and at a critical moment, Sun Lingtong hit the ruffian on the back of the head with a brick, knocking him out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo was shocked. "He... he won't die, will he?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sun Lingtong proudly dusted off his hands. "Don't worry, I know my limits."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo succeeded, but his mood was not high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He often got distracted and was filled with anxiety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sun Lingtong noticed and laughed, pulling him by the hand. "Come, follow me back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Back to do what?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Sun Lingtong led him back the way they came, letting Ning Zhuo witness the ruffian waking up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The ruffian found his belongings gone and flew into a rage, cursing loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He returned to his gang's territory, extorting and blackmailing small vendors along the way to make up for his losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo followed from behind, clenching his fists in anger. "Let's rob him again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong's eyes flashed with a sharp light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Suddenly, he said, "Little Zhuo, have you ever thought that if we rob him, he will only harm other poor people even more? There's a better way. Why don't we just kill him and make him disappear from this world forever?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo was startled, his expression filled with shock and stammered, "K-kill someone? That's not right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He had never thought of killing anyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Sun Lingtong smiled slightly and patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder, "If you don't want to, then forget it. I was just mentioning it casually." Ning Zhuo's face turned pale, "We should still teach him a lesson, give him a deep impression, and ensure he receives severe punishment!" With repeated instances of theft and assault, Ning Zhuo quickly grew in actual combat, no longer the naive novice he once was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Your mindset is still unstable and needs training. Come with me." Sun Lingtong pulled Ning Zhuo out, attaching talismans to both of them, transforming their appearances into two middle-aged men.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He took Ning Zhuo to a mortal gambling den, where they gambled heavily, experiencing both wins and losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The intense atmosphere of the casino opened Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">After several hours of gambling, Sun Lingtong took Ning Zhuo home and asked him what he thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo said he was enlightened, "So this is how these people think!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Brother Sun, you are truly amazing, like you have mind-reading abilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"You transmitted your voice to me, constantly analyzing the gamblers' mindsets. From the changes in their expressions, you could deduce the size of the cards in their hands. It's as magical as a spell!" Sun Lingtong asked the key question, "How do you feel about gambling?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo shook his head, "I don't like gambling. I prefer to follow a step-by-step approach, accumulating success gradually."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"As long as you enter a gamble, there's a chance of losing. But if you become the one running the casino, you become the player. I prefer to be the player."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"However, I also understand that sometimes not gambling is not an option!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lingtong smacked his lips, "You don't like the feeling of gambling? Just like my master?" Every time he gambled, Sun Lingtong always won more than he lost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Occasionally, he would take Ning Zhuo to a high-end restaurant, ordering a large table of delicious food to nourish Ning Zhuo's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Come, little brother, let me treat you to a drink." Sun Lingtong pushed a cup of wine towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Both of them, disguised by the transformation talismans, appeared as adult men.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo took a sip and coughed repeatedly, "It's too spicy, so hard to drink!" Sun Lingtong shook his head, "You don't understand, wine is a good thing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He originally didn't like drinking either, but over the years, repeatedly entering caves and never finding his master, he gradually began to drown his sorrows in alcohol, experiencing its benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"I have a way." Sun Lingtong called for sweet wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">This time, Ning Zhuo could drink it down, the wine was sweet and not at all harsh on the throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Then, he got drunk, his eyes blurry and his face flushed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Sun Lingtong supported him as they left the restaurant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">On the way home, Ning Zhuo saw someone beckoning to him, "Gentlemen, come and play." He curiously pointed at the sign of the Yan Hong Lou, "Brother Sun, this place should be very fun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Every time we pass by, I see people going in and out, and I can hear people playing and singing inside."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"At night, this place is the most lively!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Shall we go in and have some fun? It should be quite enjoyable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">But this time, Sun Lingtong's face darkened: "No, we are not going!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Little brother, how old are you? This is too early for you." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Let's go home, I'll take you home!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The soul-searching continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In Sun Lingtong's home, he had become a prisoner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">His soul and physical body were held by the Investigative Judge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"The Investigative Judge is one of the Four Great Ghost Judges."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"I used the Divine Seal to summon a deity. Even if it's just an avatar, it's not something a peak Qi Refinement cultivator like Sun Lingtong can resist." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Though the Void Heart Seal is strong, it shouldn't withstand my relentless soul-searching!" The Blind Judge Cheng Bai's face was cold and stern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">However, despite Sun Lingtong's soul enduring the excruciating torment of the soul-searching for most of the day, Cheng Bai still hadn't obtained any results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"How can this be?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Cheng Bai was astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He snorted coldly and finally used his superior immortal resource.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Netherworld Death Eyes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">In an instant, he could see again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">His vision revealed a dim, gray world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Only ghostly entities emitted green, blue, and other spectral lights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Cheng Bai saw the Investigative Judge and Sun Lingtong's soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The avatar of the Investigative Judge emitted a grand blue light, extremely stable, shining like a gem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong's soul emitted green light, which fluctuated violently like water waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">This indicated that his soul was suffering severe damage, and his emotions were in turmoil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Whenever the waves seemed about to burst forth, a seal would appear deep within Sun Lingtong's soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The seal was weak but resilient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">When the waves tried to escape, they would immediately dissipate upon encountering it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Seeing this, Cheng Bai immediately understood: "The divine power of the Investigative Judge is astonishing, and Sun Lingtong cannot stop his soul-searching interrogation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"But the information obtained from the soul-searching is all erased by the Void Heart Seal, turning into nothingness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"An ordinary outer disciple could never achieve this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Unexpectedly, although Sun Lingtong hasn't practiced the orthodox techniques of the Void Sect, he has such an understanding of the sect's grand principles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"What a pity, he specializes in the Boy's Technique. If he had practiced the orthodox techniques of the Void Sect, his achievements would be astounding!" Cheng Bai only took a glance before immediately ceasing to use the immortal resource.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Netherworld Death Eyes possess extraordinary innate power, and in terms of might, they are undoubtedly of the highest immortal grade. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">However, they come with a significant drawback that is difficult to avoid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Each use consumes the eyes, and over time, not only does vision deteriorate, but the eyes also completely perish. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Cheng Bai used this innate power excessively, resulting in blindness, which is extremely difficult to cure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Many powerful healing methods, although capable of restoring normal vision, would damage his innate power. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Once both eyes are blind, each use of the Netherworld Death Eyes shortens his lifespan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Thus, every time he uses it, his life expectancy decreases, a very high price to pay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Using it once is enough." Cheng Bai retrieved Sun Lingtong's soul and stuffed it back into his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Cheng Bai sneered, "Next, Sun Lingtong, scream to your heart's content. My soul punishment is unique within the entire sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Cheng Bai activated a spell and summoned various little ghosts to climb onto Sun Lingtong, pressing him down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">His entire body exuded yin energy, and cold winds swirled around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He took out coffin nails and viciously nailed them into the back of Sun Lingtong's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Thud, thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">With two light sounds, Sun Lingtong's hands were nailed to the pillar, his small body suspended in the air, feet dangling off the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Sun Lingtong's eyes widened, a guttural sound emanating from his throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He glared at Cheng Bai with eyes full of rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Cheng Bai was surprised, "Why aren't you screaming? This doesn't make sense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"I specifically put your soul back into your body to use physical punishment to affect your soul, doubling your pain. Under my soul punishment, you didn't make a sound?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Did you use some special spell to isolate the pain?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"No, that's not right. If you had, I wouldn't have missed it when I used my innate power just now!" Cheng Bai felt suspicious and summoned the Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator and the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator into the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He cast spells on them, one using coffin nails, the other using soul punishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator screamed in agony, while the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator's eyes rolled back, foaming at the mouth, and he fainted after just a few breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"That's more like it." Cheng Bai felt relieved, turning to look at Sun Lingtong with a cold and sinister expression, "I didn't expect such a small body to be so tough!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Heh heh heh, I want to see how long you can endure!" Cheng Baii's competitive spirit was ignited by Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">He began to torture Sun Lingtong, using various severe punishments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He wanted to see Sun Lingtong weep in pain, he wanted to hear Sun Lingtong's screams and cries!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
