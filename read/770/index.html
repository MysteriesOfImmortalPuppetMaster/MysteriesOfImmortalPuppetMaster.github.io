<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo’s gaze was calm as he looked at the remaining three cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He wore a solemn expression and cupped his fists in salute: "Fighting further is futile. What do you three fellow Daoists think?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The three cultivators looked at each other in dismay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Originally, if Tie Zheng and Ning Zhuo had continued to wear each other down, they would have had high hopes. However, with a single sentence, Ning Zhuo struck directly at the weakest point in Tie Zheng's heart, successfully persuading him to surrender.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The remaining three cultivators, facing Ning Zhuo who still possessed combat strength, immediately fell into an awkward situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">To fight or not to fight?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">All three showed hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath. Mobilizing his divine sense, several pieces of Profound Weapon Armor flew slowly around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The bronze long whip lashed out, producing a loud, crisp sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This sound snapped the three cultivators back to reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">One of them let out a long sigh: "Fine. Since a Golden Core like Tie Zheng surrendered, I will admit defeat as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">His declaration immediately drew glares from the other two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But as he was teleported out of the arena, the remaining two felt helpless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"I concede! Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo is indeed a cut above," the second person said, dropping his weapon and allowing himself to be teleported away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The last cultivator held a kitchen knife in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He was still in the middle of refining it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Sigh, what a pity!" He looked at the kitchen knife with regret, eventually throwing it down. He cupped his hands toward Ning Zhuo and publicly conceded as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In the limestone cave, only Ning Zhuo remained standing proudly, surrounded by Profound Weapon Armor scattered all over the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Eleven, twelve... sixteen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The cultivators of the Profound Armor Cave counted carefully, confirming the number of Profound Weapon Armor pieces in the arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Since only Ning Zhuo remained with no competitors, all these pieces of Profound Weapon Armor counted towards his score.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"First place!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Ning Zhuo is the winner of this Rising Clouds Minor Trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Another first place has emerged."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Phew, I didn't expect this result. At the beginning, I thought he would be eliminated very quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Among all the winners, Ning Zhuo will be one of the most memorable cultivators. Haha, intelligence regarding him will certainly sell for a good price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Cultivator Hao listened to the crowd's discussion, but he felt no relief. He glanced at the surrounding cultivators, a cold light flashing in the depths of his eyes: "Although the Rising Clouds Minor Trial has ended, it is not over yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">At the edge of the cliff, the sea of clouds surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Neither Ban Ji nor Ban Jie had the leisure to enjoy their tea. The mountain wind blew, ruffling their hair and clothes, leaving them feeling only irritable and cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This was because the latest intelligence had just been delivered to their hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Ning Zhuo actually became the final victor? And took first place?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"That Golden Core waste, Tie Zheng, actually surrendered voluntarily!" Ban Ji's face was covered in gloom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">His gaze was sharp, filled with anger and hatred, as he stared at Ban Jie: "Why did you split the manpower you planted this time into two waves? If you had deployed them all at once, the final result might have been very different!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ban Jie sighed and rolled her eyes at Ban Ji, thinking to herself: If I didn't control the level of assistance, how could I temper and stimulate your Royal Mandate?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Of course, she only kept this thought in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">On the surface, she explained: "If we had deployed all our manpower, it would have likely made you a target for everyone! The three Golden Core cultivators, combined with Ning Zhuo and the others, would have eliminated you first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ban Ji was not so easily persuaded: "Of course, we wouldn't have revealed our hand and used our full strength right at the start. The real opportunity was right after Tie Zheng eliminated Lu Zeng and Ao Pan. Why didn't you unleash our full power then?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ban Jie scoffed coldly: "Don't forget, before the victory was decided between the Golden Core cultivators , you and the Rust Calamity Artisan had already been forced into a disadvantage by Ning Zhuo and the others. I activated the ambushers only because I had no other choice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">She paused for a moment before continuing: "There is another point. If we had used all our manpower, how would outsiders view our Ban family? Even if you took first place, it would have been an unfair victory. At that time, not to mention others, Ning Zhuo alone would definitely make a big issue out of it. Our clan would be very passive!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ban Ji’s breathing grew heavy; he clenched his fists, veins popping out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">A wave of hostility rose in his heart, and he gritted his teeth secretly: "Reputation again! Always hesitating due to scruples everywhere; it's not satisfying at all. Ahhh! I really want to disregard everything, lead my forces to sweep through and crush them, defeating Ning Zhuo, Tie Zheng, and the rest, stepping them all under my feet!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ban Jie could not hear his inner thoughts, but seeing Ban Ji's bad expression, she could only advise him tactfully: "For this minor trial, we received strong support from the family, planting nearly ten people in ambush. It’s just that from the very beginning, we fell into Ning Zhuo's rhythm. Being forced to activate the ambushers repeatedly meant that our painstaking advance preparations yielded very low returns."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"There is one more point: I miscalculated Tie Zheng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Judging from his performance in the arena, this person likely has a Heart Demon. I activated the ambushers to help you, but it ended up making you a thorn in his side."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Reminded by these words and thinking of how the family had assisted him so much only for him to be eliminated, Ban Ji was immediately overcome by shame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He took a deep breath and shook his head slightly: "You didn't miscalculate; you just underestimated Tie Zheng. This isn't your blame either. Looking solely at the old intelligence, who could have seen that Tie Zheng had a Heart Demon?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Seeing Ban Ji's expression soften a bit, Ban Jie continued: "There is one more point that caused us to swallow the bitter fruit of defeat. That is Ning Zhuo actually having a seventh piece of Profound Weapon Armor! Yet the insider we bought off concealed this. This led to a severe misjudgment on our side!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">If she had known earlier that Ning Zhuo had a seventh weapon, Ban Jie would have included Ning Zhuo when she was secretly provoking the Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ban Ji recalled the events, emitting wisps of killing intent: "That kid Ning Zhuo is cunning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"He kept the bronze whip hidden away and didn't bring it out until the very end."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ban Ji suddenly froze, thinking of Ning Zhuo's bronze shield. The corner of his eye twitched: "That kid losing the shield - could that also have been him deliberately showing weakness to the enemy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Seeing that her persuasion had stabilized Ban Ji’s emotions and successfully shifted his attention to Ning Zhuo, Ban Jie said calmly: "It is very possible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"According to the intelligence, although he held the upper hand at the end, he used words to persuade Tie Zheng to surrender."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ban Jie rubbed the tea cup, which was full of cracks, in her hand, her expression grave: "Ban Ji, this person is different from the cultivators you usually deal with. Setting aside his innate talent, his negotiation methods alone show his insight into and manipulation of human nature."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"He is not so easy to deal with."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ban Ji said impatiently: "Do you need to tell me that? He is my Human Tribulation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Why are we still staying here? To drink the mountain wind?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Saying so, he stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">This was near the Profound Armor Cave. Ban Ji had tasted defeat here and learned that Ning Zhuo had won, suppressing him once again. He did not want to stay here any longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ban Jie sighed: "You leave first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"I still have to clean up the aftermath."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">She had bribed quite a few cultivators of the Profound Armor Cave this time; otherwise, the intelligence would not have been transmitted so quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Her assistance to Ban Ji involved activating hidden hands with too much force, which had already offended the Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Next, she needed to hurry to apologize and offer gifts to ease the relationship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ban Ji grunted in acknowledgement and left directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ban Jie’s face was unsightly as she packed up the tea set and cups, dismissed her subordinates, and flew alone toward the Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This operation was a complete failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ban Ji’s Royal Mandate was not triggered, nor did he take first place, and their relationship with the Profound Armor Cave had deteriorated significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Human Tribulation ... is this the Human Tribulation of a Royal Mandate ?" When Ban Jie looked at Ning Zhuo now, she was at least ten times more cautious than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Pivot Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Cultivator Hao knelt on the ground, having finished reporting the detailed situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He was very self-aware. Realizing that the higher-ups would definitely investigate, he took the initiative to come to the Pivot Cave as soon as the Rising Clouds Minor Trial ended. He confessed to the higher-ups and asked for punishment: he had accepted some bribes from the Ban family but did not expect the Ban family to act in such a way. However, after realizing something was wrong, he immediately took measures to cover up and disguise Ning Zhuo's seventh battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The high-ranking cultivator listened to his statement and snorted coldly, scolding Cultivator Hao with a few words. Just as he was about to let him off lightly, his expression suddenly changed as he received a divine sense transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The high-ranking cultivator immediately adopted a solemn expression, sat up straight, and said indifferently to Cultivator Hao: "You keep kneeling!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"The Lord has issued a decree: Summon Ning Zhuo for an audience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"As for your punishment, wait and see what the Lord decides."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Cultivator Hao immediately cried out in alarm: "How could such a small matter disturb the Lord?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The high-ranking cultivator shook his head slowly: "The Lord is unfathomable; every move carries deep meaning. How can subordinates like us speculate on it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Deep inside the Pivot Cave residence, a set of ancient bronze armor was enshrined year-round. It was the main body of the Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Hidden within the armor was a god named Lord Qingwu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Lord Qingwu was currently reviewing the intelligence on Ning Zhuo. From the very beginning of Ning Zhuo's participation in the Profound Armor Cave's Rising Clouds Minor Trial, right up to the end where he became the sole victor and took first place - the entire process was very complete.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Lord Qingwu chuckled and muttered to himself: "Interesting. The Ban family forcibly intervened, causing Ban Ji to encounter the bronze sword and bronze blade, but he missed the bronze shield that should have been assigned to him. It also caused the bronze long whip to be assigned to Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Later, when they revealed their ambushing manpower, it instead provoked Tie Zheng to attack. Forcing assistance led to the opposite result. It’s more like shooting themselves in the foot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">As a god, although Lord Qingwu controlled the Profound Armor Cave, he was very indifferent. He did not take the Ban family's offense to heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He focused more of his attention on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Firstly, he is not a martial cultivator or a body cultivator, but a mechanism cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Secondly, he is very young and has outstanding talent; a genuine genius."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Finally, his Qi Luck is extremely flourishing, far higher than that of ordinary people. The Ban family helped Ban Ji, but indirectly benefited him instead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Satisfying these three points, he is the fated person I have been waiting for, for many years!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Lord Qingwu made a judgment and could not help but recall a scene from the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He had made a special secret visit to Master Dunjia: "I ask the Mystic Master to perform a divination for me, to calculate my path of cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Master Dunjia was a Demon Cultivator who had been fortunate enough to obtain a fragmented inheritance of divination in his early years. Coincidentally, his true form was a mystic turtle, which matched this inheritance quite well. After thousands of years of bitter cultivation, he had accumulated some divination ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Master Dunjia had no way to refuse Lord Qingwu's request and had to perform the divination for Him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He calculated for seven days and seven nights. Upon obtaining the result, he told Lord Qingwu: "My Lord, your choice to take the path of becoming a god is correct. Just follow the steps and proceed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Lord Qingwu snorted unhappily: "It is precisely because I have encountered a bottleneck on this path that I came to find you for a divination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Do not brush me off. Tell me quickly, how do I break through next!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Master Dunjia nodded hurriedly and continued to explain in detail: "My Lord, your true form is the artifact spirit of the Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor. Because you absorbed countless Profound Weapon Armors refined by others, you accumulated vigorous Dao and principles, gradually giving birth to divine miracles and transforming from an artifact spirit into a god."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"The reason you have fallen into a bottleneck is precisely because of this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"The principles you have accumulated are too numerous and overly complex. Only by achieving purity can you go a step further!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Lord Qingwu's expression softened slightly: "Before coming to you, I also consulted many experts of the same sect. I already know this crux. I asked you to calculate how to achieve purity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Master Dunjia then said: "Lord, do not worry. I have already calculated the cultivation opportunity related to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Wait until twelve years from now. The Myriad Manifestations Sect will hold the Flying Cloud Assembly again. The Profound Armor Cave will also hold multiple Rising Clouds Minor Trials. Your fated person will stand out at this time, participate in the minor trial, take first place, and appear before you on his own initiative."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Lord Qingwu raised his eyebrows slightly: "Oh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Master Dunjia continued: "This person is a male cultivator, uniquely gifted, very young, and possesses Qi Luck that is extremely flourishing, far above ordinary people. When the Lord meets him, it will be clear at a glance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Lord Qingwu thought for a moment and asked: "Since this person is young, his cultivation is likely not high. Since he is actively participating in the Profound Armor Cave's minor trial, his cultivation is likely between Foundation Establishment and Golden Core."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Can such a cultivation level help me break through my bottleneck?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Lord Qingwu was somewhat unconvinced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Master Dunjia said: "Lord, do not worry. I have calculated the method for you. At that time, you only need to use the pretext of awarding the first place prize to instill the many True Intents within yourself into him. Strip away the principles and bless him with them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Lord Qingwu raised his eyebrows again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Master Dunjia said again: "Lord, your accumulation is too thick. The path of divine cultivation lies in the word'purity.' However, the True Intents and principles you have comprehended mainly consist of four parts. The first is Mechanism arts, the second is Artifact Refining, the third is Military Strategy , and the fourth is Martial Arts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Whichever path you choose to become a god with, you must discard the other three aspects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Lord Qingwu sighed: "I have long since found out about this method. But to instill True Intent and bless someone with principles is extremely difficult. It requires finding extremely precious materials capable of bearing True Intent and principles. It also requires the help of an Artifact Refiner Grandmaster to help me stabilize my form. Otherwise, I will suffer heavy injuries and risk disintegration. Is my fated person an Artifact Refiner Grandmaster?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Master Dunjia shook his head: "He is not. I do not know the relevant details. I only calculated that this person can help the Lord break through the bottleneck and make further progress. As for how exactly he accomplishes it, that is not within the results of this divination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Lord Qingwu could not help but narrow his eyes, half-believing and half-doubting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The past was like smoke; twelve years passed in a flash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Lord Qingwu was still half-believing and half-doubting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He smiled slightly, coming back to his senses: "Since things have come to this, I will summon this Ning Zhuo to test him, and then I will know if the divination was true or false."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"If it is false, I will definitely settle the score with Master Dunjia! Uh, I almost forgot he is already dead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Fine, fine."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
