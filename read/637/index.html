<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The yin wind howled mournfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Dark clouds still roiled in the sky, layer upon layer, pressing down oppressively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Ghostfire Prefecture Lord had already fled, unable to wait for the Painted Skin Rakshasa to break through in Forgetful River Immortal City. He had collapsed first and retreated from the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The primary weapon behind this battle outcome—the Nether Dragon Scissors—now lay sealed within the ice coffin, motionless and silent as the grave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Outside the ice coffin, the burly Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God discovered that all spells he cast were frozen by the coffin, absorbed as fuel. Forced to rely on physical blows, he relentlessly pummeled the icy casket, sending bursts of cold air and frost flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The ice coffin, formed from the entire Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle, withstood the onslaught. Though shaken and gradually worn down, it remained visibly intact, capable of enduring for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Meanwhile, the True Form of the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God—the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord—remained hidden within a tributary of the Wangchuan River, rapidly recovering in slumber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God grew increasingly frustrated. "With the Nether Dragon Scissors separated from my True Form and no longer bolstered by its fortune, I fear even more ominous changes will occur."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Hmm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Suddenly, the sacrificial altar stirred. The crimson light intensified, its radiance now flowing with a lustrous, jade-like quality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God observed the scene, his agitated aura instantly calming. "Luo Si is doing well. The Blood Sacrifice is nearly complete."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"He has proven his capabilities. Hmph, the other generals fear responsibility and are unfit for greater tasks!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"After this, he must be promoted at least three ranks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Living Realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Battlefield of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Unceasing streams of black water converged into towering mountains, supporting the entire Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Though numerically superior, the Underworld Army made no progress in their uphill assault on the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Xie Sichao's expression darkened. "Damn it! The White Paper Immortal City Lord's schemes run too deep. Using the South City Gate as a trap has cost us too many powerful warriors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"How can we break through the defenses without them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Luo Si remained impassive, silently observing the battlefield without comment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Dead Bone Giant Spirit climbed Blackwater Mountain, but the relentless downward flow of water beneath its feet constantly pushed it back. Even when it reached mid-slope, Tie Guzheng specifically targeted it, concentrating his forces to knock the giant spirit back down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Unable to approach the walls, the remaining forces—small-headed ghosts, flayed ghosts soaring through the air, and soul-hooking geckos climbing the walls—posed little threat to the fortress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">With a deafening crash, the Giant Bone Crocodile slammed into the city wall, instantly knocking several cultivators off the parapets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The White Bone Crocodile Demon struck, wielding his signature Demon Pet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">On Blackwater Mountain, his pet had grown increasingly accustomed to the terrain, repeatedly demonstrating formidable combat prowess as it relentlessly assaulted the city walls—a force the defending troops could no longer ignore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Yet even this formidable adversary was insufficient alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Full Army Assault!" Luo Si suddenly ordered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Within the central command tent, many generals cast puzzled glances at him, their expressions filled with confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But Luo Si showed no intention of explaining his strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The generals had no choice but to reluctantly obey, pinching their noses as they carried out the order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Thus, the Underworld Army launched a simultaneous, all-out assault on White Paper Immortal City from all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The pressure on the city defenses surged dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Tie Guzheng, however, felt not alarm but delight. Their strength is waning! he thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He wasn't afraid of a full-scale assault; he feared his opponents might resort to underhanded tactics. Now that they were committing to a straightforward attack, he could counter with a proper defensive battle. This was precisely his forte, and White Paper Immortal City's formidable geographical advantages ensured their success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Undoubtedly, the Underworld Army was playing to their own weaknesses while attacking their enemy's strengths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Soldiers swarmed the walls like ants, arrows rained down like hail, and countless spells clashed mid-air, with some stray bolts piercing both enemy and friendly formations, causing casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Hurry! Reinforce armor, replace talismans!" The cultivators on the walls rotated at a frenzied pace, their movements accelerating several-fold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">They didn't pause for a moment, with no time for rotation breaks. Every second was crucial for recovery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Tie Guzheng continuously received reports of casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Mentally calculating the situation, he decisively ordered the deployment of Paper Puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">These sentient Paper Puppets were a signature feature of White Paper Immortal City and had always served as its reserve forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Paper Puppets darted along the city walls, wielding talisman paper halberds, hacking Yin Soldiers climbing over the parapets into fragments. More Yin Soldiers trampled over piles of shattered bones, overwhelming the Paper Puppets in a brutal seesaw battle for every inch of ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Bone shards, shredded paper, and blood rapidly coated the once-pristine walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Underworld Army surged forward in relentless waves, each assault more ferocious than the last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The defenders of White Paper Immortal City were nearing exhaustion. Paper Talismans, Magic Artifacts, and other supplies were depleted like flowing water. The Paper Armor grew thinner, and repairs could no longer keep pace with the damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The pale walls were being stained black, eroded, and overtaken inch by inch by the dark masses of Yin Soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Even Tie Guzheng, an experienced general with extensive defense experience, couldn't help but grip his fingers until they turned white. He had never faced such devastating casualties before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Gritting his teeth, he stubbornly held on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Finally, when he saw that large sections of the city walls had been overrun by the Yin Soldiers, Tie Guzheng immediately ordered, "Have Wen Ruanyu make his move!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Within the White Paper Immortal City, at the Ink Pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">After being rescued, Wen Ruanyu had awakened and been stationed here for some time. His throat was parched from waiting, his patience long since worn thin, but he had finally received Tie Guzheng's command.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Excellent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">His energy surged. He flicked his Confucian robes aside and struck the Ink Pool's brick with both palms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Boom! Rumble...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Ink Pool trembled violently, rising straight up before being overturned by Wen Ruanyu's spiritual energy, spilling its entire contents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Confucian Technique: Total Army Ink!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Under the influence of the Confucian technique, the ink transformed into a massive ink dragon that burst through the dome and soared into the sky. As it flew, it left behind a surging tide of ink that surged and roiled, dyeing everything in its path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The once pristine white walls, towers, and pavilions were instantly stained with an impenetrable layer of dark ink. The ink tide continued to surge, crashing against the walls and swallowing every Yin Soldier in its path. The ink first enveloped them, then rapidly corroded their forms. Their skeletons emitted hissing sounds like burning embers, while the phosphorus fire in their eye sockets flickered like candles in the wind, swaying wildly before quickly fading. All their ghostly and Yin auras melted away like snow under the blazing sun, dispersing in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Their terrifying roars turned into agonized howls as their fierce charge faltered in the ink, transforming into desperate struggles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Underworld Army's formations collapsed, their combat effectiveness plummeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Tie Guzheng's eyes flashed with decisive resolve. "Now!" he commanded. "Full army charge! Kill!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The long-suppressed defenders erupted in a deafening counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The ink was harmless to them but exerted a devastating suppressive effect on the Underworld Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The defenders advanced like a razor-sharp blade through bamboo, reclaiming the lost ground along the city walls in the blink of an eye. Under the leadership of Yang Sanyan and a few others, cultivators even charged out of White Paper Immortal City, inflicting further casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Underworld Army's defeat was catastrophic, their central command banner wavering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Lord Luo Si!" Many eyes turned to Luo Si, seeking his guidance on how to counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But to everyone's surprise, Luo Si calmly ordered, "Withdraw."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The generals were utterly baffled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The Prefecture Lord gave us clear instructions," Luo Si explained. "Our primary purpose in leading this army was to perform the Offering of Tribulation through sacrifice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Now that White Paper Immortal City has suffered such heavy losses, the requirement for Blood Sacrifice has been met."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"They still possess considerable combat power, but continuing this desperate struggle would be unwise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"By my command, withdraw!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After offering this brief explanation, Luo Si reiterated his order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">When the generals heard Luo Si invoke the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, none dared to disobey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Xie Sichao, however, gazed pensively, his thoughts drifting. This blood sacrifice likely isn't just for White Paper Immortal City. The losses among our own soldiers are probably part of the offering as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Of course, he kept this speculation to himself, not daring to voice even a single word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"The Underworld Army has been defeated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"They're fleeing! They're trying to escape!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Kill them! Kill them all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Seeing the enemy's retreat, the defenders of White Paper Immortal City surged with renewed vigor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Tie Guzheng swiftly organized a pursuit force while stationing the majority of the cultivators to guard the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The pursuing troops charged forth like tigers unleashed from their cages, unstoppable in their momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The White Paper Immortal City Lord's clone personally led the chase, capitalizing on the momentum to slaughter the Yin Soldiers relentlessly. The undead forces, overwhelmed and suffering catastrophic losses, struggled to hold their ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Luo Si, however, maintained disciplined retreats, continuously deploying rear-guard units to cover the withdrawal. Though in retreat, the Underworld Army largely maintained its formation, avoiding a complete rout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"This commanding general is truly formidable," the White Paper City Lord's clone gritted her teeth inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">They had been on the verge of achieving a once-in-centuries victory, but Luo Si's tactics had severely diminished their triumph.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">As the pursuit continued, the White Paper City Lord's Clone even spotted the central command banner of the enemy army. Fueled by resentment, she clenched her jaw and hurled the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Spell—Great Primordial Goose Returning Wave!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Great Primordial Dispersal Scale erupted with jade light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The jade light coalesced into a sphere, then exploded, releasing a massive goose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">With a flap of its wings, the goose soared into the sky, flying toward the Underworld Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">As it flew, it emitted waves of radiant light. Wherever the light touched, the Yin Soldiers scattered and disintegrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Ghost Generals watched in terror, gasping in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Luo Si turned his horse to look back, snorting coldly. "Still relentless, aren't you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Since you're so greedy for more, let me teach you a profound lesson."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He spread his fingers and made a grasping motion in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">A fishing rod materialized, complete with line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Netherworld Ferrying Line, Three Lifetimes World-Hanging Hook!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The hook glimmered with spiritual light, then shot across the sky, hooking the goose in mid-flight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The goose screeched in pain, its beak caught on the hook, as it was dragged toward Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The White Paper City Lord paled with shock and urgently tried to dispel the spell, attempting to recall the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">But though the spell had been cast, there was no response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The goose's form had already been locked by the World-Hanging Hook, preventing any transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Luo Si raised his fishing rod and extended his left hand, smoothly catching the goose as it was reeled in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">With a ghostly aura and a surge of spiritual energy, he rapidly cast spells and applied talismans, suppressing the struggling goose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Seeing this, the soldiers' plummeting morale soared, reigniting their Military Might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The White Paper City Lord's clone hadn't anticipated that Luo Si would possess such a shocking method. Regret flooded her as she instinctively ordered a full-scale assault, determined to reclaim the precious Great Primordial Dispersal Scale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">But Luo Si issued a command, and Xie Sichao activated the Formation he had set up, unleashing a torrent of water from the Underworld Flood Dragon River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Yin Soldiers stood braced in the surging waters, ready for battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">This time, the advantage lay with them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The White Paper Immortal City's pursuers charged fiercely, but their gains were minimal while their casualties mounted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"City Lord, the situation is dire! Shouldn't we retreat to the city?" a subordinate ventured, his voice trembling with worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The White Paper City Lord's Clone pressed her lips into a thin line, her gaze fixed on the central military banner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The Great Primordial Dispersal Scale!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">That treasured artifact left behind by the Profound Simplicity Scholar in White Paper Immortal City—now lost because of her carelessness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Even though they were one entity, the White Paper City Lord's Clone felt too ashamed to face her True Form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Just as she was about to persevere, the Underworld Flood Dragon River underwent another transformation. An enemy Formation activated, unleashing boundless Yin Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The barrier between the Yin-Yang Worlds had been breached again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The Underworld Army ceased their retreat. Any further withdrawal would have taken them back to the Underworld itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Halting in place, they swiftly reorganized their formations, coalescing into a mountainous force that loomed before the pursuing troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The White Paper Immortal City's pursuers instinctively gathered together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Under the central command banner, Luo Si spoke calmly, his voice carrying clearly across the battlefield: "White Paper City Lord, thank you for the parting gift."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">This single sentence alone boosted his troops' morale significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The White Paper City Lord Clone's fury made her willow-leaf eyebrows bristle. She nearly ordered an immediate assault, but ultimately restrained herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Staring intently at the central command banner, she forced out the word: "Retreat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The White Paper Immortal City's forces, who had charged out of the city with overwhelming momentum, now withdrew slowly, their ranks somewhat disheveled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Lord Luo Si, shall we not pursue them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"They're not a proper army. We can use military strategy against them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Many Ghost Generals, eager to act, offered their advice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Luo Si glanced calmly around the circle. "If you wish to pursue them, go ahead. I, however, will follow the Lord Prefect's orders and return to defend the Sacrificial Altar."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Those troublesome Ghost Generals had long perished in the siege battles. Though their side had lost, Luo Si had earned considerable prestige during those conflicts. The remaining Ghost Generals fell silent, choosing to obey Luo Si's commands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The Paper Person army marched swiftly onward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">At the banks of the Forgetful River, waves crashed violently against the shore. In the distance, an Immortal City towered above the water, its cluster of pagodas rising amidst a thick, misty haze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"That's the Forgetful River Immortal City," Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin said, pointing from her war chariot to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Sun Lingtong gazed intently, his eyes sparkling with spiritual light. "The Immortal City is in the middle of the river. How can our army storm it? Even approaching will be incredibly difficult. This is the Forgetful River."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin smiled faintly and shook her head. "This army doesn't need to approach the Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Do you have any clever plan, Aunt?" Sun Lingtong asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin replied, "You just need to infiltrate their camp. My army must immediately march to Water Burial Valley."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Sun Lingtong's eyes widened in disbelief. "Ah?!" He pointed at himself, exclaiming, "Aunt, Aunt, just me, with a dozen ox cavalrymen, infiltrating the enemy's main camp?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Meng Yaoyin shook her head. "Just you. The ox cavalrymen will return to their units."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Even with his boldness, Sun Lingtong gasped and forced a bitter smile. "Aunt, Aunt, this isn't the time for jokes."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
