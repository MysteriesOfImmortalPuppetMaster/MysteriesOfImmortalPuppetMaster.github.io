<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Family Dungeon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Xiaoren sat on the straw, leaning against the wall, his expression vacant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Since being escorted here, he had been in a daze, his eyes unfocused, like a statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Soft footsteps approached.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Xiaoren's ears twitched slightly, immediately recognizing that a jailer had left his post.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Then, the door opened, and a familiar set of footsteps drew closer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Xiaoren seemed to awaken suddenly, his expression becoming lively again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He stood up and walked to the edge of the cell bars in a few steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Father!" Sure enough, the next moment, he saw a familiar figure emerge from the shadows at the cell door, stepping into the torch-lit area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">It was the patriarch of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Ning family patriarch finally revealed his true emotions, his face clouded with gloom. "Xiaoren, I came to see you." Ning Xiaoren's throat moved a few times, and he spoke with a hint of choking, "Father, I have disappointed you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Ning family patriarch nodded, his tone carrying a hint of frustration. "You have indeed disappointed me. Do you know where you went wrong this time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Xiaoren nodded. "I know!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"First, I lost the people's support long ago. Over the years, as the young patriarch, I have offended too many branch members. This time, when the wall fell, everyone pushed, and I couldn't resist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Second, I was not thorough enough. To frame Ning Ze, I should have been more decisive. Even after framing him, taking his life would not have been out of the question. This way, even if Wang Lan and others accused me today, without Ning Ze's betrayal, I wouldn't be in such a passive position!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Third, I was too complacent. I have been the young patriarch for many years, used to seeing the branch members' silent anger, used to seeing them endure with pinched noses. I underestimated them and Ning Ze. I indulged Ning Ze because he had been subservient to me for many years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Fourth, and most crucially, I underestimated Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"This young man is not simple. He utilized the people's hearts and the situation at the Lava Immortal Palace. He only has a third-layer Qi Refining Stage cultivation, appearing weak, but his methods are very sophisticated. I never thought such mature handling would appear in a sixteen-year-old boy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Ning family patriarch nodded and sighed. "Your analysis is very logical. It seems you haven't lost your spirit. However, although Ning Zhuo is a key figure, today's situation may not be solely his doing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Ning Zhuo has some reputation, but he can't command everyone. Ning Youfu, Ning Houjun, and others appearing almost simultaneously must have been secretly coordinated and communicated in advance. The clan members were mobilized too quickly; some of them were likely prepared, waiting for the situation to escalate. The ancestral hall elder smelled the strong scent of conspiracy, so he didn't defend you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Xiaoren's face darkened, and he nodded heavily. "I no longer hate him. The ancestral hall elder made a rational decision. At that time, I could no longer face the overwhelming evidence. If he had defended me, he would have lost his position as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Ning family patriarch said, "It's good that you understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Xiaoren asked, "Father, what should I do next? You must have a plan, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Of course." The Ning family patriarch nodded. "According to my arrangement, you will be imprisoned for three years. This is actually your opportunity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"In the dungeon, you must diligently study talismans, develop excellent ice talismans, and contribute them to the family to atone for your sins. I have already prepared the relevant talismans for you, from the relics of a cultivator in the Northern Wind Kingdom. About a year later, when the situation has completely calmed down, you can slightly modify the talismans and present them. In the coming days, you will focus on diligent cultivation in this dungeon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Xiaoren nodded. "Understood, Father. I will treat this as a closed-door cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Ning family patriarch said, "Good, I am pleased with your attitude. Such setbacks are also opportunities for growth. A person's life is filled with mistakes and failures. Only by overcoming them can one become a true hero."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Xiaoren sighed. "I will remember your teachings, Father."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Ning family patriarch said, "When you present the talismans, I will reduce your punishment according to the clan rules. At that time, you can stay in the family instead of being expelled."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"This Ning family is ruled by our main branch. As long as you stay in the family, you will have opportunities to make contributions and climb back up step by step."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Xiaoren frowned. "What about the opinions of the other main branch members?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Ning family patriarch snorted coldly. "I have already communicated with them. The branch members' recent display of power has made us main branch members vigilant. They are aware of your past efforts to suppress the branch members. Therefore, they unanimously agree to show the branch members who is in charge of the Ning family!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"In the future, I will discuss with them more, and perhaps I can get some merits from them to further reduce your punishment. For now, you need to stay in the dungeon and wait for the storm to pass."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Father, I understand!" Ning Xiaoren's emotions completely calmed down. "What should we do next to clean up the mess? As for Ning Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Ning family patriarch interrupted him. "We will not immediately trouble Ning Zhuo, nor will we suppress him in the slightest. He is currently in the limelight, and all the branch members are watching him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Any unfair treatment will only make the branch members sympathize with and support him more, boosting his momentum. In fact, we will give him many resources in the near future to ease the tension between the main and branch families."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Xiaoren's eyes flashed with cold light, and he gritted his teeth. "Give him more, the more, the better! This kid is extremely greedy, just like me. I don't believe he won't fall for it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Let him receive the family's favor and support. I don't believe the branch members won't be envious and jealous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Use this tactic to divide his connection with the branch members!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"We are wary of him because he has become a banner for the branch members, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Ning family patriarch chuckled, showing satisfaction. "Xiaoren, you haven't let me down. We have already planned to do this. However, it may not succeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"According to our discussions, most believe that Ning Zhuo has a high-level mentor guiding him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Today, the branch members gathered too quickly. Ning Youfu, Ning Houjun, and others seemed to have coordinated and acted in unison."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Xiaoren nodded, gritting his teeth, his eyes cold. "If we catch him colluding with outsiders, that would be great! Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"I never thought I would fall to a young brat like you. It's a great humiliation. One day, I will return this humiliation to you tenfold!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Xiaoren swore, unable to suppress his deep-seated hatred for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Ning family patriarch nodded, satisfied with Ning Xiaoren's mental state. "Son, carry this hatred and cultivate well." The father and son exchanged a few more words before the Ning family patriarch turned to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Father!" As the Ning family patriarch was about to disappear into the shadows, Ning Xiaoren called out, "Be wary of Ning Zhuo! The more I think about it, the more I feel that this kid is not simple, very not simple!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Ning family patriarch paused and turned back, nodding slightly. "I will keep a close eye on him. If today's events were not orchestrated by someone behind him but were his own plan, that would be quite terrifying. Let's see his next move."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Today, he returned victorious, his reputation soaring. It's a rare opportunity. Let's see if he can recognize and seize it to truly build his momentum."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Gui's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In the master bedroom, Ning Zhuo's uncle and aunt sat by the bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Aunt Wang Lan was checking Ning Zhuo's uncle's body, using spells to heal his wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Her eyes were red, and she choked, "Husband, you have suffered this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Gui sighed. "This time, it's all thanks to you. How did you decide to tell Ning Zhuo the truth?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Wang Lan said, "I never thought about it this way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"After visiting the prison, I was ready to execute our planâ€”to kneel before Ning Zhuo the next day and force him to return to the reformation team. Who knew that night, when I opened the door, Ning Zhuo scared me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Ning Zhuo had already entered the room, waiting for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Ze's eyebrows raised slightly. "Hmm? Tell me more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Wang Lan said, "I don't know where Ning Zhuo got his information, but as soon as he spoke, he revealed the secret that 'I went to visit the prison, and Ning Xiaoren wanted to use me and you to force him to bow down.' I was very flustered at the time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Ning Zhuo then told me that after you were framed for embezzling his cultivation resources, he secretly investigated and found many flaws, raising many suspicions. He then revealed his guess, and he guessed the truth!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Then he asked me if I could still trust Ning Xiaoren's character and if I wanted to continue being used by Ning Xiaoren. To truly save you, Ning Xiaoren was absolutely unreliable; we had to rely on ourselves!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Wang Lan sighed. "Husband, I was persuaded by him. He made too much sense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Then he told me that Ning Xiaoren had made fatal mistakes with too many flaws. He had already contacted important figures in the branch family and planned to cause a huge commotion the next day to take down Ning Xiaoren!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"I was shocked by his plan and wanted to participate, but I was also very worried about failure, which would ultimately harm you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Ning Zhuo forced me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"He threatened me, saying that if I didn't cooperate, he would let Ning Xiaoren's arranged crime ruin your reputation, making you unable to hold your head up in the family for the rest of your life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Husband, I know you too well. If Ning Zhuo really did that, you would rather die than live."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"In the end, I had no choice but to follow his plan."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
