<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 415: Countless Treasures</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The reason Sun Lingtong confirmed that the opponent was dead was that he used his celestial spirit eye to check.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Of course, he also knew that he was only a Foundation Establishment cultivator; the gap in cultivation level compared to a Soul Formation expert was like heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But he still had the means of the Ten Thousand Li Dragon for reconnaissance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This mechanism was at the Nascent Soul level, and investigating a Soul Formation being was far outside the gras of of Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Sun Lingtong stared at the stone sphere in front of him, feeling puzzled: "A Soul Formation existence has already perished."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He then thought of the group of black-robed cultivators he had been following and quickly reconstructed the basic outline of the truth in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"It seems these people are actually here to pay their respects, wanting to meet or awaken this Soul Formation existence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"This existence clearly is not a proper cultivator, which is why the group outside would set up a formation, essentially sacrificing their own."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"They never expected that the Soul Formation existence had already passed away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Although cultivators are powerful, there were many instances of them passing away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">For example, low-level cultivators immersed in cultivation forget to eat, leading to starvation. This kind of situation used to happen frequently in ancient times, which is why the Fasting Pill was developed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Or similar to Ning Zhuo previously, who delved too deeply into the Dao laws, expended too much mental power, and ended up burning out their brain, becoming senile at best, or outright dying on the spot at worst.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Many higher-level cultivators, having hit a bottleneck in their cultivation, exhausted all other means to no effect, could only enter a secluded state. A secluded state, as the name implies, means not stopping until the goal is reached. Itâ€™s either a breakthrough in cultivation or death! This usually occurs when a cultivator's lifespan is nearing its end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Could it be that this Soul Formation existence was also nearing the end of its lifespan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong guessed in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">His heartbeat quickened, and he murmured: "Exciting, this is really too exciting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Outside the cave, only four black-robed cultivators remained, communicating with their divine senses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After arguing for a moment, one of them stepped forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He took out a crimson token from his bosom and infused it with spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Then, he took out a piece of talisman paper and wrote on it, crafting a flying message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">At the end of the message, he raised the token and shot out a symbol to mark the message, indicating his identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The cultivator, risking his life, sent the flying talisman into the abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">After completing this step, he directly knelt on the ground with his forehead pressed against it, performing a grand act of worship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Meanwhile, the other three black-robed cultivators also did the same, extremely tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The flying message soared quickly, reached the bottom of the cave, and then hovered around the sphere, flying in circles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun Lingtong took a light breath and immediately activated the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, swallowing the flying message directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The black-robed cultivator maintaining the flying message felt a huge shock in his heart; he sensed he had lost contact with the message. He could feel the message had not been destroyed, but had simply vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">This was even more chilling than if the message had been destroyedâ€”it felt like a stone tossed into an abyss, with no echo returning from the bottom of the cave for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong began to feel anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"This group of black-robed cultivators is willing to sacrifice themselves just to see the Soul Formation existence here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"They are clearly driven by some powerful force behind them!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"This flying message could mean someone will enter personally next time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"My time is limited; I need to quickly find the Soul Formation's legacy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">However, Sun Lingtong, navigating the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, circled the cave bottom several times but found nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The cave bottom was utterly empty. There wasn't even a shadow of treasure; just stones, everywhere stones!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The mechanical dragon continued to observe the outside of the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The four black-robed cultivators had gathered at the cave entrance, wanting to step inside but were extremely tense and hesitating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Sun Lingtong sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He didn't want to kill these people. Not to mention that the four of them were all Foundation Establishment cultivatorsâ€”there were many of them, and their methods were unclear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">They undoubtedly had a significant figure behind them. Killing them would attract the attention of that big figure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Those who could take the initiative to visit a Soul Formation existence would at least have to be at the Nascent Soul level in terms of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I just arrived at Thousand Peaks Forest with Ning Zhuo and already attracted a Nascent Soul level, even Soul Formation cultivator. This really isn't suitable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">If Sun Lingtong had found the remains of the Soul Formation, that would be one thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The key was that he hadnâ€™t found anything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Not only did he fail to gain any benefits, but he also offended a significant figure for no reason, which was highly irrational.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Ah, oh." Sun Lingtong scratched his head, feeling particularly unwilling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">It was clearly a tremendous opportunity, but it seemed like he was going to return empty-handed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"A little risk shouldnâ€™t hurt." Sun Lingtong thought it over and, with a resolve, controlled the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, gradually approaching the only giant stone sphere at the bottom of the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">On the surface, the stone sphere looked very ordinary. But under the reconnaissance of the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, Sun Lingtong could sense it contained many Dao Marks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Ten Thousand Li Dragon opened its mouth and shot out a magical tool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">It was released by Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The magical tool struck the stone sphere, immediately cracking it with large fissures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"What?!" The stone surfaceâ€™s defense was weaker than Sun Lingtong had imagined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In the next moment, the stone skin fell away, revealing dazzling treasure light inside, shining outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong couldn't help but open his mouth wide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Even while being within the mechanical dragon, his face was illuminated, and so was his entire body by the brilliant light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"I'm rich, I'm rich!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong couldnâ€™t help but cheer in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">From that small cracked area, he saw a piece of Arcane Yellow Mother Stone, a handful of Earth Spirit Soil, a piece of Celestial Meteorite, and a piece of Purple Crystal Obsidian!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Arcane Yellow Mother Stone, with its deep earth patterns, emanated a heavy earthy energy. It was a fragment of the roots of the earth, possessing strong defensive abilities and highly stable properties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Earth Spirit Soil contains the essence of the earth veins, which can only be found deep underground or at junctions of earth veins. It is excellent planting soil. The growth speed and medicinal effect of the planted spirit herbs will greatly increase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Celestial Meteorite and Purple Crystal Obsidian were also exceptionally precious, not to mention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"These four materials are all at the Nascent Soul level!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong was so excited he nearly drooled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He quickly released more magical tools and began to dig.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">One by one, the treasures were excavated and absorbed into the body of the Ten Thousand Li Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Iridescent Miraculous Jade, Blood-Scorching Demonic Stone, Luminous Stone Essence, Gloomy Black Soil...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">These treasures had two common points. The first was that they were all related to the earth element, being either stones, jades, or soil. The second was that their grades were all very high, all at the Nascent Soul level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"This transformation cultivator might specialize in the earth element and is likely an earth elemental being."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The outer layer of the stone sphere is filled with Nascent Soul level materials, and digging into the inner layer should yield Soul Formation materials, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Sun Lingtong licked his lips and continued digging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This feeling was truly wonderful for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Of course, he didnâ€™t lose focus, always paying attention to the group of black-robed cultivators outside the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The heavy treasure was right in front of him, and if this group barged in now, they couldnâ€™t blame Sun Lingtong for taking drastic actions!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">However, contrary to Sun Lingtong's expectations, the four black-robed cultivators ultimately did not step inside; after hesitating and struggling, they bowed and turned to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">When digging, Sun Lingtong naturally used his methods to obscure sound and light so that they were unaware of the actual situation at the cave bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong dug away the outer layer of the stone sphere and obtained a large number of treasures, simply skyrocketing to wealth overnight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But when he continued to dig deeper, he encountered enormous obstacles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">No matter what means he used, it was difficult to shift the now shrunken stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Moreover, the stone sphere trembled slightly and began to absorb a large amount of earth element spiritual energy. This spiritual energy adhered to its surface, continuously condensing and forming new stone skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The stone skin rapidly covered the treasure light and quickly thickened at an observable rate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Sun Lingtong's eyes shone brightly: "Could it be that these stone skins will gradually transform into Nascent Soul level materials?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He immediately set to work, digging again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The newly formed stone skin was very fragile; after being scraped off, it was just ordinary stone, making Sun Lingtong extremely disappointed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"It seems the transformation of stone into various treasures requires a long time; it can't be achieved overnight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong reached the inner layer but could still find nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Hehe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I'll call Ning Zhuo out and let him think of a way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"His big head is always useful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Iâ€™m very curious, no matter how hard this stone sphere is, can it compare to the Great Serpent Scythe?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Just as this thought crossed his mind, the mechanical dragon suddenly erupted with an ear-piercing alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sun Lingtongâ€™s expression changed dramatically; he quickly raised his hand and saw that his hands were covered in a layer of lime, gradually turning to stone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"What, whatâ€™s going on?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong quickly mobilized his spiritual energy, infusing it into his hands to resist the petrification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Although the petrification speed was significantly alleviated, it remained tenacious, continually eroding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Sun Lingtong hastily took out pills to swallow, trying various spells, but with little effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Is this a massive trap?!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
