<paragraph index="1">Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Damn it, what does the real exit look like? This is so frustrating!" Chi Dun charged forward recklessly, crashing through one door after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But behind each door was yet another secret pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Pavilion after pavilion... Chi Dun suspected he had fallen into an endless loop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"If I had known it would be like this, I might as well have stayed to guard Fire Persimmon Immortal City and battled the Scarlet Flame Beasts!" But there was no choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">This was a direct order from Meng Kui!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Hmm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">After crashing into one pavilion, his eyes suddenly brightened as he saw a Shadow Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Shadow Demon Cultivator opened a door and vanished in a flash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Where do you think you're going!" Chi Dun was overjoyed and quickly gave chase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After pursuing through three pavilions, the Shadow Demon Cultivator seemed to have a clear goal. Chi Dun noticed that each time the opponent chose a door, it was without hesitation and with a methodical approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The distance between them continued to shrink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Chi Dun finally caught up with the Shadow Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He punched with all his might, his fist carrying immense force, tearing through the air with a powerful gust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Shadow Demon Cultivator turned mid-air, raising an arm to block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">With a loud crash, the Shadow Demon Cultivator was sent flying back at an even faster speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Chi Dun remained in place, gritting his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">A large orange-yellow talisman was imprinted on his chest, its edges spreading outwards, forming a massive sealing force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Chi Dun's eyes were bloodshot, his body and mind filled with violent rage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He pushed his Golden Core stage power to the limit, his muscles tensing, heat rising, and his tendons bulging like dragons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He exerted all his strength to slowly lift his head, a simple action that felt as difficult as lifting a mountain due to the seal talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Chi Dun ignored all this, staring intently in the direction the Shadow Demon Cultivator had fled, roaring in his heart: "It's him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Despite only a brief encounter, Chi Dun immediately realized that this was the same Shadow Demon Cultivator he had previously fought and chased into the Fire Persimmon Forest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"I can't believe I found you, ah!!!" Chi Dun shouted, breaking the seal talisman on his body with a full-force swing of his arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Blood gushed from his mouth and nose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">But he paid no heed, driven by the fury in his heart, charging towards the direction where the Shadow Demon Cultivator had disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Bang, bang, bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The sound of doors crashing and closing blended into one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Who goes there?" A Golden Core disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion was also exploring the secret pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Within his divine sense range, a cultivator with a Golden Core aura suddenly appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Shadow Demon Cultivator? Heh, I'm one too!" The Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple's smile quickly faded as he realized the other was heading straight for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple's face turned solemn, fully alert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">In the next moment, the Shadow Demon Cultivator burst into the pavilion, and the two faced each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Shadow Demon Cultivator didn't pause, choosing the door on the left and entering again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple relaxed, but his divine sense detected another Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">It was Chi Dun!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He tensed up again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">After all, this time he was disguised as a Shadow Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Chi Dun saw the Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple and didn't care, diving into the left door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Under Chi Dun's divine sense, he had already detected the strong aura of the Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple but kept his focus on the previous Shadow Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Seeing Chi Dun leave in a hurry, the Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple relaxed again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He was about to continue exploring but suddenly changed his mind. He had no leads himself, and seeing Chi Dun's determined look, he decided to follow and see!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Chi Dun was still within the divine sense of the Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple, who decisively moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The pursuit continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Quick, help me stop that Shadow Demon Cultivator ahead!" Chi Dun's divine sense detected a Meng family Golden Core cultivator, and he quickly sent a message seeking help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Meng family Golden Core cultivator, having been defeated and fleeing due to Zheng Dan's betrayal, had taken a pill and was resting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Receiving Chi Dun's message, he immediately cooperated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Shadow Demon Cultivator was held up by the Meng family Golden Core, allowing Chi Dun to catch up again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The three began to battle in the pavilion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Boom, boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Thick black smoke exploded, poisoning divine senses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In the smoke, several black pythons pierced through the battlefield, forcing Chi Dun and the Meng family Golden Core to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The ferocity of the attack slowed even the approaching Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Shadow Demon Cultivator repelled the two enemies and withdrew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Chi Dun and the Meng family Golden Core broke free from the smoke and continued their relentless pursuit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Within their divine sense, Zhu Xuanji suddenly appeared!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The two Golden Core cultivators were filled with doubt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Chi Dun, however, was overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">By common sense, the Meng family and Zhu Xuanji were already at odds. But Chi Dun, being a physical cultivator, didn't think much and directly sent a message: "Divine Constable Zhu, ahead is the Shadow Demon Cultivator who fled into the Fire Persimmon Forest!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Oh?" Zhu Xuanji's eyes gleamed upon hearing this, and he immediately set off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He too joined the pursuit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">However, he was further away than the Meng family Golden Core and Chi Dun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The pursuit team was growing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Another Shadow Demon Cultivator appeared within everyone's divine sense range.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Chi Dun and the Meng family Golden Core didn't recognize him, but Zhu Xuanji knew the true identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Brother Zhou, quickly block that person!" Zhu Xuanji sent a message through divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhou Nongying, disguised as a Shadow Demon Cultivator, naturally needed his own people to know. Especially Zhu Xuanji! Otherwise, being killed by his own people would be too unjust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Receiving the message, Zhou Nongying immediately threw out a formation disk, setting up a formation at the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Shadow Demon Cultivator opened the door and fell into the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zhou Nongying's smile froze on his face the next moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The formation rose, its patterns twisted, space rippled, and the Shadow Demon Cultivator passed through the ripples, easily escaping the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Divine Ability—Escape in Battle?!" Zhou Nongying's heart sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">His entire skill set was almost entirely focused on formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Shadow Demon Cultivator mastering this divine ability was his nemesis!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The Shadow Demon Cultivator charged straight at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Zhou Nongying's heart raced, his fighting spirit wavered, and he instinctively retreated to the side, creating distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">As a result, he left the door behind him open, allowing the Shadow Demon Cultivator to push through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Realizing his mistake, Zhou Nongying didn't dare pursue and hurriedly began dismantling the formation to avoid blocking his own people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Setting up the formation was easy, but dismantling it was relatively difficult, and he was in a frantic rush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Through divine sense communication, Zhu Xuanji learned from Zhou Nongying that the Shadow Demon Cultivator possessed the divine ability to escape in battle, and his heart sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Countless clues in his mind surfaced, showing signs of connecting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">At this moment, the Shadow Demon Cultivator took the initiative to contact Zhu Xuanji through divine sense: "Divine Constable Zhu, instead of chasing me, why not investigate the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Let me tell you: over the years, the Dragon Turtle has exploited small loopholes in authority, modifying the Lava Immortal Palace. It constructed several channels from the Qi pool, seemingly stealing Qi, accumulating bit by bit for unknown purposes." Zhu Xuanji's heart sank, thinking of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He snorted coldly, continuing the pursuit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">At the same time, Zhu Xuanji sent messages through divine sense, instructing the Shadow Demon Cultivator to stop and accept investigation; meanwhile, he contacted Zhu Zhen, informing him of this crucial clue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Zhu Zhen was overjoyed upon receiving the clue: "Brother, in my previous investigation, I did find some structures that seemed redundant, temporarily added. Following this lead, I might find the hidden Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon!" He immediately took action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">This move thoroughly alarmed the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"What is Zhu Zhen looking for?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"You're not dealing with the numerous beasts, not fighting other Golden Cores, what are you looking for?!" Zhu Zhen's target was so obvious, he was following the Qi channels, tracing the source.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">It was anxious!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"I've been exposed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon is exposed too!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Damn it, when did the Zhu family learn this secret?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">It wanted to escape now, to dive into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Impossible!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The Lava Immortal Palace still bound it, preventing escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Meng Chong, you useless fool!" it roared, furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Meng Chong was already at a disadvantage in his battle with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo released several mechanical constructs to guard himself, resisting Meng Chong's relentless attacks. Meanwhile, he stood at the door, assembling wooden blocks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">This situation plunged the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit into despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">It was extremely anxious, knowing Meng Chong was bound to lose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">To resolve the predicament, a breakthrough was necessary!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">With no other choice, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit mustered its courage, breaking its own limits, and contacted Meng Kui!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Meng Kui, if you don't act now, it'll be too late!!" "Who?" Meng Kui was surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The next moment, he smiled slightly: "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, you finally stopped playing dead and contacted me. Rest assured, everything is under my control..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared in anger, interrupting him: "Fool! You have no idea, that Ning Zhuo..." It had just begun when a fiery guillotine formed instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't move, awaiting execution!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The guillotine fell mercilessly, beheading the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit once more, its head and body separating. The dragon head's eyes widened, rolling to the ground, then transforming into specks of spiritual light, drifting away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Lava Immortal Palace strictly prohibited revealing cultivator information, and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, in its anxiety, violated the rule, getting beheaded before it could speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The information it wanted to reveal was thus halted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit?" Meng Kui's calls received no response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In an instant, his heart sank!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"I was blinded by fate energy, thinking everything was under control."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Though the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit didn't speak, it was enough for the wise Meng Kui!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Seizing this opportunity, he saw through the illusion of fate energy, his mind becoming completely clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He intended to use his divine ability to observe the battlefield's fate energy pattern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The timing was wrong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Meng Kui sensed the opportunity slipping from his grasp, calculating with furrowed brows, growing tighter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Inside the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit panted heavily, regaining its vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Its form was less than thirty percent of its complete state, its body dim and lifeless, filled with lingering fear, its spirit exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Meng Kui's divine sense kept calling: "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, if you want freedom, you must join forces with me! Do you know, Zhu Xuanji already knows your disloyalty?" "It was Ning Zhuo who harmed me!" At this point, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could only think of the paper Ning Zhuo gave Zhu Xuanji, that poem! It couldn't guess wrong, this was Ning Zhuo's scheme!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Are you bullying me because I don't understand literature?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Plotting against me right in front of my face. Despicable, truly despicable!" Meng Kui took a deep breath, casting his spell with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Two Qi hands abandoned the front line, flying towards the lightning wall formed by the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities. They dissolved automatically, eroding the pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Technique—Immediate Retribution!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">In the world, karma and retribution are inevitable, only awaiting the right time.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
