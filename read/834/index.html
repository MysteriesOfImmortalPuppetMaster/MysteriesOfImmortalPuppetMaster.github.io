<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">This was the strategy Sun and Ning had devised!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">It didn't matter if they couldn't out-calculate it; they would simply interfere with the water formation, ensuring that whatever calculations it produced couldn't be implemented in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Sun Lingtong watched with a surging heart, his face full of excitement. He wanted to cheer for Ning Zhuo, but fearing he might distract him, he could only applaud silently in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The core of the Luo Shu Water Formation was a single page from the Dao Artifact, the Luo Shu. It was indeed incredibly powerful. However, the duo of Sun and Ning had their advantages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">One of their advantages was that they had secretly taken control of the Shuyu Studio. borrowing the power of this cave abode's formation, Sun and Ning could use superior force to suppress their target!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In contrast, while the core of the Luo Shu Water Formation was incomparably strong, the foundation constructing the water formation was merely composed of damaged treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The foundation of the water formation was very thin!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sun and Ning fully utilized their advantage, pressuring the entire water formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The rotation speed of the water vortex slowed down, and the formation patterns became increasingly chaotic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">No matter how the Luo Shu page adapted, its overall strength simply couldn't compare to the opposition; it was being put in an overly difficult position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">A tiny crack suddenly appeared on the surface of the water vortex!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This was an energy fault caused by the stagnation of the formation's operation reaching a critical stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Now!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Essence light shot from Ning Zhuo's eyes as he thrust out both hands, his ten fingers fluttering like dancing butterflies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Streaks of spiritual energy shot from his fingertips, rapidly carving formation patterns onto the surface of the water vortex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">A Formation within a Formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong’s eyes widened as he held his breath and focused. He knew this move by Ning Zhuo was crucial. If he could successfully build the formation, then even if they failed this time, it wouldn't cause too much of a commotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo fully displayed his Master-level formation attainment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Various formation-laying techniques emerged one after another, revealing the gains Ning Zhuo had made from sweeping through the formation trials earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Soon, fine beads of sweat seeped from the big-headed youth's forehead, but his fingers remained as steady as a rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">One breath, ten breaths, twenty-seven breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">When the final formation pattern landed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Buzz...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The water vortex trembled violently, and then, slowly ceased its rotation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Luo Shu page continued its frantic calculations, but its results could no longer be transmitted to the original formation - because the formation had been "taken over" by Ning Zhuo's new formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">And the function of this new formation was to be useless!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">It could be said that the Luo Shu page had been sidelined and isolated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A flash of joy crossed Sun Lingtong's face, but soon, his expression turned solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Because the new formation began to change!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Formation patterns twisted, formation lines reorganized, and formation eyes shifted - everything happened in an instant. The speed was even faster than the water vortex before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Sun Lingtong couldn't help but be startled internally: "So, the calculation ability of the Luo Shu page had never been fully unleashed until now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">From the moment Sun and Ning infiltrated the Shuyu Studio, Sun Lingtong had been studying the Luo Shu page and the surrounding water formation. It was only now, when they made their move, that they truly forced out the upper limit of the Luo Shu page's capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The new formation changed faster and faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo's expression was grave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Luo Shu page was the source of mathematical principles. Ning Zhuo's formation-within-a-formation was inside the water formation, so it would inevitably be understood, penetrated, and eroded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Even though this was formed from Ning Zhuo's own spiritual energy, it wouldn't last long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The new formation trembled violently, its patterns twisting madly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Luo Shu page was attacking with full force, wanting to take over the new formation as quickly as possible. At the same time, the external water formation was exerting pressure inward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"In the end, it has no intellect, only instinct. Luo Shu page, come into my hand!" Ning Zhuo shouted in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He activated the Formation-Gap Traversing Shuttle, first following the cracks in the water formation to charge through the formation-within-a-formation, rushing straight towards the Luo Shu page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The page trembled slightly, its form suddenly becoming ethereal and blurry before splitting into ten copies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Nine fake, one real!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath. Thoughts rose and fell in his mind, his thinking speed pushed to the extreme by intense mental consumption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He used the formation-breaking treasures in his hands one after another, throwing them into the water formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Seven of the page's phantoms were dispersed in succession, but at the final moment, three remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The formation-breaking treasures in Ning Zhuo's hands were exhausted. In the time it would take to retrieve them, the page could completely regroup and recreate ten illusions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">At this moment, Sun Lingtong's heart inevitably hung high in his throat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He knew that if they failed this time, they would have to find another way to plot for the Luo Shu page. Because the series of changes this time would become data for the Luo Shu's calculations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Therefore, the difficulty of breaking the water formation and seizing the Luo Shu would increase with each attempt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Which of the three is real?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">In this instant, Ning Zhuo's gaze was electric. He knew his predicament - he had to choose one immediately. If he chose the real body, he would succeed. If he chose wrong, he would fall short at the last step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He didn't have any more time, not even a little bit, to think. Fortunately, at the critical moment, his Master-level attainment triggered his spirituality once again, and a wave of intuition welled up from the bottom of his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But this intuition was quite faint, because while breaking the formation, Ning Zhuo had been constantly bathed in the Luo Shu's Dao Rhyme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Although the intuition arose, there were other sensations, chaotic and confusing, like looking at flowers through a fog.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Crucially, the experience Ning Zhuo gained from sweeping the formation trials played its part, allowing him to grasp that intuitive sense with incomparable precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Alright, it's you!" Ning Zhuo struck decisively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Spiritual energy surged out, transforming into a hand possessing all Five Elements spiritual energy. It forcefully charged into the water formation, broke through the formation-within-a-formation, and grabbed directly toward the deepest part of the water vortex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The hand of Five Elements spiritual energy grabbed the page on the left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Luo Shu struggled, its essence manifesting; it was indeed the true body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, mobilizing his divine sense to retract the Five Elements palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Luo Shu page struggled instinctively, actually using Dao Rhyme to erode the Five Elements spiritual energy palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The surface of the latter immediately began to deform slightly, but then quickly calmed down - Ning Zhuo's attainment in the Five Elements was even deeper than his formation attainment. The Luo Shu tried to influence and penetrate it with its Dao Rhyme, but Ning Zhuo immediately adjusted it gently, forcing it back to its original form!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The moment the Luo Shu page was extracted, the new formation was free from infringement and instantly stabilized, falling completely under Ning Zhuo's control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">In contrast, the swirling water formation began to tremble violently. Because the original formation had lost its core, the most central foundation of this formation was gone, and a rapid collapse began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">But this situation had been anticipated by Sun and Ning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo immediately tossed the Luo Shu page to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Sun Lingtong had long been waiting in battle readiness. He activated a prepared theft technique to directly suppress the Luo Shu page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo went all out, pouring his spiritual energy and divine sense into the new formation as if they cost nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The new formation operated at high speed, emitting waves of light halos. The halos spread out, covering the swirling water formation wave after wave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In this moment, the new formation replaced the Luo Shu page, becoming the core of the swirling water formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The collapse of the water formation continued, but under the guidance of the new formation, it was no longer violent and ferocious, but greatly delayed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Eventually, the swirling water formation was consumed to nothingness amidst continuous attrition, without triggering any explosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The new formation was also tattered and broken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo was so tired his whole body trembled slightly, and his vision went black. His spiritual energy was almost completely depleted, and his divine sense had hit rock bottom; he needed rest urgently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong grabbed the Luo Shu page and jumped to Ning Zhuo's side, supporting the big-headed youth: "Little Zhuo, you did it, we succeeded!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">His face was pale, his body soaked in sweat, and his fingers trembled slightly. This wasn't his first time breaking a formation, but the Luo Shu page had brought him immense pressure, possessing an overwhelming advantage in calculation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The difficulty of Ning Zhuo breaking this formation far exceeded all the Rising Cloud Minor Trials he had encountered before, and the consumption was enormous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Fortunately, although it was difficult, everything went smoothly!" Ning Zhuo smiled, looking at the Luo Shu page with a lingering gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This was his mother's relic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">With this, he could finally be considered to have inherited all the items Meng Yaoyin had left in the Myriad Manifestations Sect cave abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Mother, I have finally completed one of the things you entrusted to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Although I haven't determined the entry point for joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect yet, everything is looking up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"When will you wake up?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Following Meng Yaoyin's instructions, Ning Zhuo had been waiting for unusual movement from the Great Serpent Scythe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Having achieved great success in breaking the formation and retrieving the book, Ning Zhuo took the Luo Shu page back to the Blue Stone Cave Abode first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Luo Shu page was merely suppressed; Ning Zhuo still needed to refine it before he could use it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Lingtong remained in the Shuyu Cave to tidy up the Divination Room, doing the preliminary preparation. He would wait for Ning Zhuo to free up his hands before repairing the formation in the Divination Room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ultimately, Sun and Ning would try their best to eliminate traces of their infiltration before leaving the Shuyu Studio. They would wait until Ning Zhuo's identity was exposed to reclaim the Shuyu Studio through the formal channels of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">While Sun and Ning split up to act, the Ban family was also making moves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="179"/>
<paragraph index="181">Ban Clan Territory, Ancestral Hall Secret Chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">In the center of the secret chamber, a bronze mechanism standing three zhang tall stood silently - it was the Ban family's clan-guarding treasure, the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Several Supreme Elders sat around the mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Let's begin," one of them said in a deep voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Immediately, the present Supreme Elders acted simultaneously, their spiritual energy surging and pouring continuously into the mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Buzz - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The bronze mechanism shook violently, and countless components began to rotate slowly. Sliders moved up and down, chains pulled left and right, and wheels spun back and forth. Clicking sounds were as dense as rain, as if the entire mechanism was waking from a deep sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">In the secret chamber, an invisible pressure permeated the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">One breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ten breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Forty breaths...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The rotation of the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain became faster and more violent. Sliders almost derailed, chains were pulled taut, and wheels emitted ear-piercing friction sounds. The entire mechanism was trembling, as if bearing some immense pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">A Supreme Elder was moved: "Ning Zhuo's Qi luck is even more tyrannical than before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Only after fifty breaths did light and shadow emerge, gradually solidifying to depict the scene of Ning Zhuo's Qi luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Several Supreme Elders hurriedly focused their gaze to watch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">They saw an arm symbolizing Ning Zhuo's Qi luck, existing between emptiness and reality, grasping a small nebula.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The nebula was about the size of a human head, deep blue throughout, with countless starlights flickering inside. Every star was breathing, every ray of light was beating, as if it were a miniature starry sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The nebula struggled violently, wanting to break free from the arm's grasp. But those five fingers were clamped down like iron pincers; no matter how the nebula struggled, it couldn't escape in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Expressions of astonishment appeared on the faces of the Supreme Elders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The last time they observed his luck, the Qi luck arm was only grabbing Ice Attribute Cold Qi. Now, it was grasping a nebula.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"What is going on?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"What major event is Ning Zhuo up to now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"For this nebula to show such signs of Qi luck, it must be something extraordinary! Has Ning Zhuo obtained some major opportunity?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The faces of the Supreme Elders were all very grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ban Ji was the hope of their entire clan, bearing the Royal Mandate. And Ning Zhuo was Ban Ji's Human Tribulation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">With Ning Zhuo obtaining a major opportunity now, there would inevitably be a major improvement. Ban Ji, however, was still using the Golden Core to cleanse his physical body. With such a trend, even if Ban Ji came out of seclusion, he likely wouldn't gain any advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Look closely, there are new changes within Ning Zhuo's Qi luck palm as well," a Supreme Elder spoke up to remind them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Everyone hurriedly looked closer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">They immediately discovered that on Ning Zhuo's Qi luck palm, there were many palm lines. These lines were dense, layered, and tightly arranged, containing great profundity, looking like... formation patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The group fell silent for a few breaths before someone realized: "This should correspond to Ning Zhuo's ability in the Dao of Formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Recently, Ning Zhuo successively rejected Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang, throwing himself wholeheartedly into formation trials, sweeping through nearly ten related Rising Clouds Small Trials in one go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"According to the latest intelligence, his outstanding performance has already attracted the attention of Wenren Yan, a high-level figure of Heavy Formation Peak. Ning Zhuo personally hosted a banquet inviting Wenren Yan and Shen Xi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Ning Zhuo hides quite deeply. Only now has he revealed this skill."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">None of the Supreme Elders had expected that Ning Zhuo's formation-laying ability was a newly added strength. Such a massive leap in ability was something they had only heard of but never seen with their own eyes in their entire lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">They simply assumed Ning Zhuo had been holding back all along and only recently used his full strength. For such a posture to be revealed in the vision of Qi luck was entirely normal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The expressions of the Supreme Elders became even uglier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Naturally, they made associations: Besides the Dao of Formations, did Ning Zhuo have other hidden strengths?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Impossible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"How old is he? One look tells you he's a vigorous young junior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"How much time does a person like that have? Besides cultivating his technique, he practices mechanic arts. And he has such attainment in formations!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"He is also proficient in various righteous path methods. Since coming to the Myriad Manifestations Sect, he has flourished..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"He cannot possibly have other hidden strengths."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Perhaps, the Dao of Formations is his main cultivation, and mechanic arts are just a cover."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The Supreme Elders voiced their opinions one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">They continued to observe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Above the Qi luck arm, plain white paper formed a thin book. Countless pitch-black ink droplets spilled from the book, pouring down like a sudden rainstorm onto the Qi luck arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Sizzle, sizzle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Tiny lowercase characters, formed of ink, emerged on the surface of the arm. These characters were extremely fine and dense, covering the entire arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The ink characters gathered, forming articles one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Once the articles were complete, they lifted on their own. The "skin" of the Qi luck arm curled and changed along with them, turning into flipping pages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The outermost pages peeled away from the arm like fallen leaves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">With each page that peeled off, a wisp of Qi luck was taken away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The expressions of the Ban family Supreme Elders softened considerably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"The entanglement between Zhao Hansheng, Gu Qing, and Ning Zhuo actually hasn't been resolved yet!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"This is a good thing. Looking at the current state, the threat that master and disciple pose to Ning Zhuo is even greater and deeper."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"But clearly, Ning Zhuo hasn't had any dealings with that master and disciple recently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">The group discussed it but remained puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
