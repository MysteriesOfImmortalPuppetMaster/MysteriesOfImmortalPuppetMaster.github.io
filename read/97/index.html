<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 97: Everyone Knows You Were Wronged</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo's pace gradually quickened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Bringing Yuan Dasheng with him to explore the immortal palace carried a certain level of risk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">After all, Meng Chong might enter at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Without Yuan Dasheng holding the line in Room 3, Meng Chong could easily charge right into the maintenance room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Hopefully Meng Chong’s unconsciousness lasts a while. I need as much time as possible to explore the palace!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">When he thought of this, Ning Zhuo suddenly felt a flash of insight. The Theory of Numbered Breaths sprang to the front of his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“The Lava Immortal Palace is like an arena, with Meng Chong and I both trapped inside. Even if we don’t face each other head on, our fate energy is already clashing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“I took the initiative, setting up traps and obstructing him at every turn. That gave me the advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“But he grew stronger with every setback. He went through special training and improved rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Facing a crisis, I had to draw in Han Ming. Then, in Purple Sun Villa, Meng Chong suddenly appeared and defeated her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“If he had acted more decisively, pursuing Han Ming relentlessly and finishing her off, then I would have had no way out. If I failed to change my name, it would be an indirect defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Not long ago, I managed to eliminate Yuan Dasheng. According to Han Ming, that gave me a significant increase in fate energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Thus, I was able to use Yuan Dasheng to defeat Meng Chong and leave him unconscious, suppressing him once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“I just can’t tell… once he makes his comeback, how strong will he have become?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">By the time Ning Zhuo finished processing this sudden enlightenment, he had once again arrived in front of the three doors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“These three doors are actually flaws.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“Zhu Xuanji once witnessed Yuan Dasheng using the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique. Although it was only briefly, he must have memorized its aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“In the future, if someone cultivates this demonic technique, Zhu Xuanji will definitely notice something and begin questioning the truth behind Yuan Dasheng’s death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“His new suspicions will trigger a new investigation, and that investigation would be extremely dangerous for me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Sigh, if only I could hide this Demon door.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo had already given it a try. Unfortunately, even when he poured all his power into the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, he couldn’t cause the stone wall to rise again and cover up the Demon door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“What I need to do now is seize every second and explore with all my might.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo was not only racing against Meng Chong and Zheng Jian, but also against Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“This time, I’ll go through the Buddha door first!” Ning Zhuo had long made up his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The main reason was that Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was of extremely high quality and gave him a pronounced advantage in clearing rooms behind the Buddha door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">However, the first door he pushed open was actually the Demon door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After entering the Demon door, he quickly came to a halt. His primary purpose was simply to obtain the blood energy within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He didn’t keep a single trace of the blood energy, instead channeling it all into Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">In an instant, Yuan Dasheng’s red musculature began emitting a dark crimson glow. A sinister demonic aura surged forth, exuding an air of dominance and brutality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, which had been watching Ning Zhuo closely, saw this and was so furious that fire spewed out from its nostrils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Normally, trial participants couldn’t retreat once they entered. No matter which of the three doors they chose, they had to continue on that route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">But Ning Zhuo could cheat with the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and retreat at his leisure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This small excursion gave Yuan Dasheng a huge boost!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">With Yuan Dasheng at his side, Ning Zhuo was unstoppable as he rampaged through the rooms behind the Buddha door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Just as expected, Yuan Dasheng’s Essence Refining cultivation base was extremely high when it was alive. It must have cultivated the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique to an advanced level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“With its complete body and soul as the primary material for the mechanical construct, the resultant spirituality carries deep imprints from its actions in life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“That’s why it can use blood energy so well, allowing it to create huge swathes of blood sinews.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo blew three rooms and stood in front of the third door once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“What kind of reward will it be this time?” He had a hunch that the reward would be extremely valuable, especially considering that he hadn’t received anything from passing the second room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Sure enough, when Ning Zhuo touched the door, he immediately received a message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">A dozen or so different options appeared in front of him, dazzling to the eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">His first thought was, “Can I keep retreating and re-entering to collect all the rewards?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“I’ll choose one first, then try it out. Which reward is the best?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After studying his options, Ning Zhuo found that most were either spells or mechanical blueprints. The only unique item was something called the Illusory True Lotus Seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Illusory True Lotus Seed? What’s that?” Ning Zhuo wondered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been eagerly awaiting this moment and instantly sent an answer. “The Illusory True Lotus Seed contains the imprint of a divine ability. Once planted, it assists the cultivator in fully comprehending the imprinted divine ability. It is incredibly rare and extremely precious, with very limited supply…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Crack crack crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The fire whip lashed out wildly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">But the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit braced itself with all its might. No matter how hard the fire whip struck, it refused to send another word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">And since no more information arrived, Ning Zhuo instinctively assumed that that was the full explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Limited supply, extremely precious? Then I’ll choose it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Once Ning Zhuo made his selection, a phantom image of the lotus seed flew out from the door and drilled into the deepest part of his divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“…That’s all? And then?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo stood dumbly in place for a moment, a bit dazed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Once planted, the Illusory True Lotus Seed almost completely disappeared. Even Ning Zhuo himself had difficulty locating it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He tried many methods, but to no avail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Maybe I need my soul to return to my body before I can access it,” Ning Zhuo guessed, clinging to hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Unbeknownst to him, in the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was rolling on its back in laughter. Its claws were pounding on its turtle shell, drumming out a melody of joy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Finally! Finally, it had pulled one over Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">For the current Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, although the pain from the lashings was very real, the satisfaction in its heart was even more intense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The information it had concealed was this: Although the Illusory True Lotus Seed was precious, the probability that a cultivator could comprehend a divine ability from it was extremely low. There were many Golden Core cultivators who planted an Illusory True Lotus Seed but gained nothing at all. This was because all these lotus seeds contained the imprint of only a single divine ability – the Life-Hanging Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In the mind of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, a mere Qi Refining cultivator like Ning Zhuo had absolutely no chance of comprehending it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo pushed open the door and entered a new transit hall, seeing another set of Buddha, Dao, and Demon doors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He immediately tried using the Buddha Heart Demon Seal to go back to the previous room, and was shocked to discover that opening the door this time was significantly more difficult than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">A sense of unease washed over him. “Could it be that at this point, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal’s influence is no longer enough?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Seeing this scene, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit became even more calm and composed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">It knew the real reason. Rather than the Buddha Heart Demon Seal itself not being enough, Ning Zhuo’s Qi Refining cultivation base was just too low. He could only use a small portion of the treasure seal’s power; at this point, it could no longer easily affect the trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The only way would be for Ning Zhuo’s cultivation base to rise significantly, but that wasn’t something that could happen in a short period of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo paid a great price and finally succeeded in returning to the previous room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">When he touched the door again, he found that he could indeed choose another reward. This time, he picked a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Then, he opened the door once more and entered the transit hall again. He didn’t continue trying to go back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The cost was simply too great.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo moved toward the Buddha, Dao, and Demon doors and found that the mechanism behind them was more or less the same as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After touching each door, he obtained the respective content for the fourth through sixth levels of each of the three techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Finally, I can continue cultivating. These techniques came just on time!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo let out a sigh of relief. Although he had already guessed as much, it wasn’t until now that he could truly relax after reality confirmed his guess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He took a trip around the transit hall and found nothing else of note. Thus, he went back through the previous door, chose another reward, and returned the way he came.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He went all the way back to Room 3 and left Yuan Dasheng there. Then, he returned to Room 2, finding the others still trapped and unaware of the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo took the initiative to jump into a pit trap and waited silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">After the others were sent back to their bodies due to soul exhaustion, he waited it out for a bit longer before using the trial disciple imprint to casually return his own soul to his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Two days later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Xiaoren led Ning Zhuo into his study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">As soon as he entered, Ning Zhuo saw Ning Ze kneeling on the floor. Blood was dripping from the man’s forehead; he had clearly already been struck by an inkstone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Xiaoren’s face was full of pain as he said to Ning Zhuo, “At first, I really couldn’t believe it. Not until the evidence was laid in front of me, not until I heard it in person from your uncle’s mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Ning Zhuo, my dear nephew, I never expected this. I truly never expected that your uncle could stoop so low!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“He actually embezzled the cultivation funds I secretly sent to you every year!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo’s pupils contracted. His face was full of disbelief and anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Uncle, is this true?!” Ning Zhuo growled at Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Ze’s body trembled. Slowly, he lifted his head to look at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">His gaze was turbid and his face was extremely grim. His body was covered in signs of a harsh interrogation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Ze looked first at Ning Zhuo, then at the sharp-gazed Ning Xiaoren. Filled with despair, he took a deep breath and said in a heavy voice, “Yes, I did that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo’s body trembled slightly. He couldn’t help but take a step backward, and Ning Xiaoren reached out to steady him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Overwhelmed by this mental blow, Ning Zhuo shut his eyes tightly with tears flowing down his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">His vision darkened, and scenes from the past filled his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“Kneel!” Holding a bamboo rod, Ning Ze spoke in a fierce and severe tone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The child Ning Zhuo held his head high. “Why are you punishing me? I already said it wasn’t me. I really didn’t do it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The bamboo rod lashed down heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">A red mark instantly appeared on Ning Zhuo’s cheek and rapidly began to swell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">But Ning Zhuo still held his head high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Ze flew into a rage and swung the bamboo rod again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Smack. Smack. Smack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo was beaten until his knees buckled, and kneeled involuntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“Uncle, why don’t you believe me? I was wronged. I didn’t do it. Waaaah...” Ning Zhuo raised an arm to wipe away his tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“Still talking back!?” Ning Ze threw down the bamboo rod and turned away. “You’ll kneel here until you admit your fault. Until then – no dinner for you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">That time, Ning Zhuo knelt from dusk till dawn. In the end, he fainted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The next morning, Wang Lan said to Ning Ze, “Husband, Little Zhuo’s temper may be wild, but he’s always been honest. At the very least, he has never lied to us.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“I don’t think he was the one who did it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Ze snorted coldly. “Of course I know that he’s being wronged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“But what could I do?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“The actual culprit is the son of the war hall elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“We can’t afford to offend them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“As long as Ning Zhuo admits to being at fault, the matter will be settled. If he continues to resist, it will only bring greater trouble!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Wang Lan whispered, “Oh, so that’s how it is.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“You did the right thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“Suffering a little injustice is nothing for a child.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
