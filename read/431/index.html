<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 431: I Do Have Some Divination Skills</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The grand formation besieging the Heavenly Pillar Giant Tree was withdrawn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Mo Yuan and the other two Nascent Soul cultivators waved their hands, retrieving the formation flags, disks, and other items back into their pouches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The three cultivators transformed into rainbows and flew through the sky toward their sect's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">On the way back, the Lord of the Demon Heart Cave used divine sense to communicate, expressing his confusion: "Great Cave Master, the three of us came together, having strength in numbers. Why did we need to take out such a precious treasure like the Western Pure Land to give to the Old Stone Monster?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"We could have completely forced him to sign the divine decree of the Ginseng Beard Dragon King!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Lu Hongtu's eyes flashed with a trace of cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Did you not sense it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Old Stone Monster already has a trace of Soul Formation-level aura!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Lords of the Demon Heart Cave and Blood Shadow Cave were both stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Demon Heart Cave Lord said in surprise and uncertainty: "Could it be that Old Stone Monster has already advanced to the Soul Formation stage?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Lu Hongtu shook his head slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"This cultivator originated from a ten-thousand-year earth essence, and his own accumulation is extremely deep. However, he once devoured a fragment of the Treasure Dividing Rock."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Although he gained the divine ability of Stone Forged Earth Treasure, this fortuitous encounter was not without drawbacks â€”it greatly hindered his cultivation speed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This was a very common situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Along the path of cultivation, cultivators had to face this difficult choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">That was, whether to increase their cultivation base and power or to master divine abilities and techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">If the cultivation base improved, one's own foundation would be strengthened, and there would be growth in all aspects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">But if one only had cultivation base without divine abilities and techniques, the cultivator's combat power would be very worrying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Having profound cultivation but no combat power, it would be difficult to survive calamities when they occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">But if one focused on divine abilities and techniques, spending a lot of time and energy on them, it would also hinder the progress of one's cultivation base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">If the progress of cultivation base was too slow, and when the lifespan limit was reached the cultivator had not broken through to the next stage, then it was akin to seeking one's own death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Therefore, choosing between cultivation base and divine abilities and techniques had never been a single-choice question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">As a normal cultivator, one had to balance both.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">But which was more important, and at what time period, and what to choose as the focus of cultivation, all varied from person to person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">After Old Stone Monster devoured a fragment of the Treasure Dividing Rock back then, he had made rapid progress in divine abilities and techniques, undergoing a qualitative change!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">But this wonderful divine ability also hindered his cultivation progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Lu Hongtu knew this quite well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"If the Old Stone Monster had advanced to the Soul Formation stage, his attitude toward us would not be like this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"It can only be said that he is nearing Soul Formation, facing the critical point of breakthrough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"In this situation, it's appropriate for me to give him the Western Pure Land."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Demon Heart Cave Lord and Blood Shadow Cave Lord immediately understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Facing the Old Stone Monster who was about to reach Soul Formation, Mo Yuan Cave Master needed to show goodwill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">If in the future, Old Stone Monster advanced to Soul Formation and Mo Yuan Cave Master had had conflicts with him, he would inevitably suffer pressure and gain nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">It's better to give him the Western Pure Land now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Old Stone Monster's true form was a ten-thousand-year earth essence; a virtuous treasure like the Western Pure Land, which was of earth attribute, was extremely helpful to him and could bring about a qualitative change. This would greatly enhance his chances of advancing to the Soul Formation stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The grudges between Lu Hongtu and Old Stone Monster were not deep enmities. Sending this treasure, when Old Stone Monster succeeded in advancing in the future, they would inevitably let go of past grievances, and moreover, Old Stone Monster would remember the favor of Mo Yuan Great Cave Master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Even if Old Stone Monster failed to advance, the Western Pure Land was still of great use to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The favor of Mo Yuan Great Cave Master still existed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">And it sounded very good when spread out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Mo Yuan Great Cave Master did not force other Nascent Soul cultivators to join the grand alliance of Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Instead, he took the initiative to offer precious treasures like the Western Pure Land, achieving cooperation through incentives. In this way, Mo Yuan Cave Master was selfless, sacrificing his own interests for the future of the Thousand Peaks Forest; this was an act of noble character!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">It was worth mentioning that the Six Cave Sect was not a purely demonic force but rather both righteous and evil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Lu Hongtu had profound insight into the overall situation; he knew that to deal with the indigenous forces of the Thousand Peaks Forest, he must have a tough and domineering side, so he recruited Nascent Soul cultivators like Demon Heart and Blood Shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">At the same time, he also understood that if he was only tough, domineering, and ruthless, it would be equivalent to cutting himself off from the outside world; such a Six Cave Sect had no future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Therefore, he recruited the other two Cave Masters, actively establishing good relationships with the outside world. The Six Cave Sect's evil and domineering actions were mostly used internally, which helped them gain a foothold in the Thousand Peaks Forest. Their righteous conduct allowed them to have more connections with the outside world, helping them exchange countless cultivation resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Having channels to communicate with the outside world enabled the Six Cave Sect to use the resources of the Thousand Peaks Forest to have extensive contact, trade, and good relations with outside forces. On the other hand, they sold external resources to various large and small forces within the Thousand Peaks Forest, making huge profits and gradually attaining a transcendent status.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">All these were the results of Lu Hongtu's spirit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">At this moment, the Mo Yuan Cave Master was plotting for the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"If Old Stone Monster can really break through to Soul Formation, then he and the Ginseng Beard Dragon King will inevitably have a battle!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Ginseng Beard Dragon King, as the only Soul Formation-level existence in the Thousand Peaks Forest, had been entrenched here for countless years, deeply rooted, with numerous believers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"One mountain cannot accommodate two tigers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"If Old Stone Monster wants to continue cultivating in the Thousand Peaks Range, he will inevitably involve the earth veins of the Thousand Peaks Forest, which will seriously touch upon the Ginseng Beard Dragon King's fundamental base."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Thinking of this, Mo Yuan Cave Master's eyes shone brilliantly, his heart thumping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"By then, when the two tigers fight, one will surely be wounded!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Is there an opportunity for me in this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"However, all of this has to wait until the crusading army of the Two Note Country withdraws..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">At the bottom of the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After the stone sphere had been silent for a long time, it began to loosen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Crack, crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Cracks appeared on the surface of the stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Lines of cracks quickly spread, eventually breaking open gaps, from which Sun and Ning emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After confirming that the three Nascent Soul cultivators had all left, they still patiently waited for a period before crawling out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"So thrilling, really too thrilling!" At this time, the stone layer on Sun Lingtong's body had already been unraveled by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He applied another layer of medicinal mud, currently moving freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Even someone like Sun Lingtong, an evil sect cultivator who enjoyed seeking thrills, at this moment, was completely limp, unable to muster any strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The situation just now was too dangerous; with the slightest carelessness, a mistake in response would have allowed the three Nascent Soul cultivators to see through them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">At that time, the fate of Sun Ning and his companion would have been unimaginable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">A strong feeling of lingering fear enveloped Sun Lingtong's body and mind, making him not want to move for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo's gaze was focused on the ground beside him, where there was a handful of Western Pure Land.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The interaction with the three Nascent Soul cultivators had elements within his expectations and also some that were beyond his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo had not expected that Lu Hongtu would take out the Western Pure Land, nor had he expected that they would be forced to sign the Ginseng Beard Dragon King's divine decree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"From this, it can be seen that Lu Hongtu came prepared!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"According to the collected intelligence, this person has excellent overall vision and can even spend from his own pocket to unite with other Nascent Soul cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Moreover, under the enormous pressure of the Two Note Country's crusading army, the Thousand Peaks Forest is changing its old state of numerous factions; a large number of people and forces here are rapidly integrating."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">From this matter, Ning Zhuo immediately confirmed the change in the situation of the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">In such a time of crisis, having a powerful leader was really crucial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Thousand Peaks Forest benefited from the Ginseng Beard Dragon King, avoiding a state of disunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Ginseng Beard Dragon King was the local deity. Based on the characteristics of a deity and being the greatest beneficiary, He himself was inevitably the most steadfast defender of the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">At the same time, he was at the Soul Formation level, the strongest combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Therefore, various cultivators and forces who did not wish to become homeless dogs were all rallying around this backbone, actively uniting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Lu Hongtu brought the divine decree, which made it easier for Sun and Ning to muddle through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Currently, Sun Ning and his companion had both signed the divine decree and were now under control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But this advantage was also a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Just now, Sun and Ning, using the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat and employing the Stone Forged Earth Treasure divine ability, merged themselves with the stone sphere, being regarded by heaven and earth as a complete fetus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong's acting, Ning Zhuo's control, and the stone sphere's own disguise were all indispensable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The three combined, leveraging the mysteries of the "Great art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing," only then did they deceive the three Nascent Soul-level cultivators like Mo Yuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Mo Yuan forced Old Stone Monster to sign the divine decree; Sun Ning and his companion had no choice but to comply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Their divine senses, merged into one through the disguise of the Stone Forged Earth Treasure divine ability, together touched the divine decree, knowing the explicit decree within. Finally, they used their divine senses to sign the divine decree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Therefore, the divine decree simultaneously bound Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and the stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"What should we do next?" Ning Zhuo felt worried about this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sun Lingtong directly asked, "Little Zhuo, do you think we can break this divine decree?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo's expression was heavy; he slowly shook his head and said in a low voice, "This is a Soul Formation-level method. Although it's not impossible to break, the price to pay is really too great."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"If we seek help from the military of the Two Note Country, we will inevitably expose our itinerary, reveal our trump cards, and the secret that Old Stone Monster has already died."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"According to the secret actions that Lu Hongtu previously confided, the Thousand Peaks Forest must have planted many spies within the Two Note Country's army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Therefore, they could know the major military intelligence that the new army in the Green Forest Immortal City is about to depart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"If we seek help from the Two Note Country's military, there is no one we can trust."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"It is very likely that our information will be leaked. If the Thousand Peaks Forest side learns of this, and we have signed the divine decree, then just a single thought from the Ginseng Beard Dragon King would make us die without a burial place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sun Lingtong fell into silence. What Ning Zhuo said made a lot of sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sun Lingtong sighed, "Yes, we have suffered so much, paid such a huge price, and finally obtained astonishing wealth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Even if the Two Note Country's military does not leak this secret, if we want to break the Soul Formation-level divine decree constraint, I'm afraid the wealth we just obtained would be exhausted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"If we encounter some unscrupulous people who raise the price arbitrarily, we might even have to pay more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"If the commander-in-chief of the Two Note Country, Du Tiechuan, knows that we possess the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, he would probably force us to keep going deep into the Thousand Peaks Forest to gather military intelligence!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Then, what about returning to the Southern Bean Country?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Just as Sun Lingtong said this, he shook his own head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The time was too insufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">According to the time requirements on the divine decree, the new army of Green Forest Immortal City would depart in four days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">By then, Sun Ning and his companion had to fully participate in the attack against the Two Note Country's army, in compliance with the divine decree, and not violate it, to have a chance to survive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Alas, what else can we do? Let's take it one step at a time." Ning Zhuo shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Let's not mine the final body of Old Stone Monster. This is part of the divine decree constraint; we can regard it as the body of the two of us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"In the future, if the two of us take action and it's not in the full state when the divine decree was signed, and is considered that we did not go all out, that would be terrible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Sun Ning and his companion, after a brief discussion, had no other way but to continue their previous actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">After Ning Zhuo comprehended the complete divine ability of Stone Forged Earth Treasure, he cooperated with Sun Lingtong to dig out the entire stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The two did not mine it but directly stuffed it into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Finally, they rode the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, traversed the void again, and returned to the vicinity of Green Forest Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon became even more tattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Previously, it was already fifty percent damaged; after this trip, the outer shell was severely damaged, and many dragon scales were lost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Many places had also undergone petrification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo wrapped the tattered Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon around his waist as a belt, walking slowly all the way back to the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"The military advisor is back!" The soldiers, seeing Ning Zhuo, took the initiative to salute and greet him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Previously, on the command platform, Ning Zhuo had used the "Tree Realm Descends" spell, stunning the entire audience, thus gaining the respect of the whole army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo observed the drills of the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Seeing that they had not noticed at all that he had misappropriated public funds, he shook his head secretly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">These three generals really had big hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">He returned to his tent and calculated the accounts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Midway, he put down his pen and sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Not long ago, he was on the brink of life and death; now he was in his tent, outside were the occasional shouts of the three generals and the cultivators' yells, and a sense of security welled up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo felt a sense of being in a different world, an unreal feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"The military intelligence of the Two Note Country has been leaked; the Thousand Peaks Forest side is preparing to ambush the new army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"I am the military advisor and sacrificial officer of the Three Generals Camp; at that time, I will inevitably march with them and become the target of ambush by a group of Nascent Soul and Golden Core cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"What's worse, Big Brother Sun and I have also signed the divine decree; we must deal with the Two Note Country, and we have to go all out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">At this moment, the curtain of the tent was lifted, and Liu Er walked in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"What should we do about this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">This really made Ning Zhuo feel troubled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Seeing Ning Zhuo frowning, Liu Er immediately showed a kind smile: "Military advisor, making you manage the accounts really puts you in a difficult position."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Zhuo hurriedly stood up and saluted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Liu Er waved his hand, kindly indicating that they were all on the same side and there was no need for such formalities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Liu Er did not put on airs, and his manner was like a spring breeze, which indeed made Ning Zhuo feel relieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo sighed, "The military accounts can be calculated clearly, but the prospects are worrying, my lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Currently, our military expenses can only last for three months."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">In fact, Ning Zhuo had misappropriated a large number of spirit stones, which was already insufficient to support three months.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">He had not yet had time to balance the accounts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Ning Zhuo continued, "And during the process of calculating the accounts, my mind was touched, and I had many bad premonitions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"I felt that the future was gloomy, so I deeply sighed and felt depressed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Upon hearing this, Liu Er immediately became interested: "Military advisor can have such feelings; could it be that you have the ability of divination?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, "To say that I am a diviner, I dare not accept such praise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"But I have indeed cultivated one or two divination methods and am most skilled in array calculations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">"My lord, please allow me to use some military funds to set up an array and calculate the future of our Three Generals Camp!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Liu Er hurriedly asked about the cost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Ning Zhuo then gave a number.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Liu Er fell into hesitation. The military funds were already scarce; if they were to be spent on divination, they wouldn't even last three months.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">"These military funds are not mine alone; I need to discuss with Second Brother and Third Brother." After pondering for a while, Liu Er replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Ning Zhuo then extended his hand, "Please discuss it as soon as possible, my lord; time is of the essence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Liu Er nodded and sighed, "I will go and inquire now; military advisor, please wait a moment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Liu Er left the tent to find Zhang Hei and Guan Hong, who were still drilling the troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Seeing him act like this, Ning Zhuo knew that he no longer needed to repay the accounts in the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
