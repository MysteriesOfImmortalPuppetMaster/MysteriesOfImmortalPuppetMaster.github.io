<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Virtually all Soul-Searching Techniques extract the subject's memories for the cultivator to review.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This is akin to reading a book, but the content is unfiltered and overwhelmingly vast, with less than one percent likely to be truly useful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">From this perspective, Confucian cultivation possesses a significant advantage. The classical texts studied by Confucian cultivators are veritable pearls of wisdom, each word a gem, greatly enhancing cultivation efficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Having mastered all the Soul-Searching Techniques recorded by Tian Shuang, Ning Zhuo held an edge even within the Soul Devouring Sect, placing him at the forefront of the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He discovered that only the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique allowed cultivators to experience another's memories as if they were their own. The knowledge gained through this method was nearly indistinguishable from personal experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">However, the technique's immense drawbacks were unbearable for most.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">There must be other methods to mitigate or counteract this flaw. My Innate Talent is one such means.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's ambitions run deep. If his century-long scheme succeeds, he'll likely soar to unimaginable heights."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"No wonder Yang Heaven seeks to thwart his path to enlightenment!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo needed to perform soul searches and rely on his true self to gain experience. But the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord possessed innate talent, allowing him to immerse himself in the Forgetful River and directly extract memories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This method was far more efficient than Ning Zhuo's individual soul searches!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">If the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord acquired this innate talent, his entire Dao Path would undergo a transformative qualitative shift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo studied diligently and practiced extensively, now fully realizing that the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique would be an indispensable spell in his future cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"My mastery of the Soul Dao and Yin Attribute remains weak, only at the initial stages. To improve the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique, I would need to invest an immense amount of time and effort."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"For the time being, focusing on resolving the five major flaws of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique is the most practical approach."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Having mastered numerous Soul-Searching Techniques and gained a deeper understanding of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique, Ning Zhuo now grasped the true nature of the so-called Five Calamities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Five Calamities were: first, Name Loss; second, Consciousness Blaze; third, Boat Marks; fourth, Karmic Burning; and fifth, Lost Navigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"The true purpose of this spell is to entice people to cultivate it and create soul materials. Therefore, the greater the transformation of the soul, the more severe and negative the consequences."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Consciousness Blaze occurs when the Soul's influence reaches the Upper Dantian Divine Sea, disrupting the condensation of divine sense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Boat Marks, on the other hand, arise from excessive Soul modification, causing the Soul to become incompatible with the Physical Body and damaging it. It's similar to how my excessively strong Soul cultivation once caused various bruises and marks to appear on my Physical Body. However, the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique is far more severe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Having grasped the underlying principles, Ning Zhuo devised countermeasures for each of these drawbacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The solution was simple: since the spell modifies the Soul, he would simply refine the Soul back to its original state after using the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This Soul modification lies hidden deep within the Soul, making it difficult to detect. Otherwise, the spell wouldn't have deceived so many cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">But Ning Zhuo, having mastered the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique, was an exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">However, he still lacked inspiration on how to refine the Soul back to its original state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"That doesn't matter!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Since I can detect the modified portions of the Soul, I'll just excise them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">It was akin to having a piece of flesh cut from the Physical Body - the Soul would naturally be injured. But with the Four Treasures of Soul Cultivation and numerous soul cultivation methods and healing techniques at his disposal, Ning Zhuo could easily heal the Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Just like Lady Spiderweb earlier, a significant portion of her Three Souls had been extracted and woven into soul cloth. However, with proper rest and treatment, her Soul would eventually recover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique was inherently against the natural order. By using the Three Souls Spinning Wheel Technique as an auxiliary method, one could avoid easily causing others' Souls to scatter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This approach allowed Ning Zhuo to effectively circumvent the Red Lotus Karmic Fire, the most critical of the Five Calamities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The other four calamities differed fundamentally from this one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Red Lotus Karmic Fire wasn't a mere side effect of Soul modification; it was a miniature heavenly tribulation triggered when the practitioner's accumulated sins reached a critical threshold!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Jade Slip of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique warned: "In mild cases, yin fire will surge, burning meridians and destroying networks. In severe cases, flames will erupt from the five viscera, self-cooking the practitioner into a stew!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This clearly demonstrated the catastrophic consequences of such a calamity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"I need to understand how much karmic debt each use of the Soul-Burning Boat Crossing Technique incurs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"What method can accurately measure this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This was a crucial question Ning Zhuo needed to answer. Without this knowledge, every future use of the technique would be fraught with anxiety, preventing him from fully utilizing its potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In the era of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, this problem might have remained unsolved. But now was the golden age of cultivation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Even in other Immortal Cities, finding a solution might have been impossible. But this was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main headquarters!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Moreover, the Flying Cloud Assembly was still in its early stages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo quickly found three methods by reviewing the intelligence jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">After pondering for a moment, he made his arrangements. Selecting one of the methods, he contacted Sun Lingtong through Life Hanging by a Thread: "Boss, I need you to go out and buy some supplies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Upon hearing Ning Zhuo's explanation, Sun Lingtong immediately set off in secret. He left Jade Cleansing Hall and headed straight for Yu Heye's cave dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo left his Blue Stone Cave Dwelling and made his way to the nearest branch of the Demon Subjugation Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Myriad Manifestations Sect comprised eight peaks and sixteen halls, with the Demon Subjugation Hall being one of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Yang Sanyan, a comrade-in-arms of Ning Zhuo, was a key figure in the Demon Subjugation Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Demon Subjugation Hall had already held its Rising Cloud Trial. Their purpose was clear and singular: to recruit new members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo descended from the clouds, entered the Demon Subjugation Hall, and arrived at an inner gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Cultivators guarded the entrance. Ning Zhuo presented his wooden token and was granted entry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Stepping through the gate, his vision abruptly shifted, transporting him into a spatial formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Black stone walls surrounded him, while the ground was a deep, eerie swamp that glowed with an unsettling, dim light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Sinking Karma Swamp!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">At the center of this artificial swamp stood a stone platform, upon which rested a plaque. Four majestic, gilded characters, radiating righteous energy, were inscribed on it: "The Clear Mirror Hangs High."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">On the steps beneath the plaque sat several cultivators, their Qi deep and profound, clad in the dark cyan robes of high-ranking members of the Demon Subjugation Hall. Their gazes, sharp as lightning, periodically swept across the swamp, scrutinizing the cultivators struggling through the mire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Demon Subjugation Hall, one of the Sixteen Halls, offered exceptional benefits and compensation, naturally attracting a flood of newcomers eager to join its ranks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The grueling trek through the Sinking Karma Swamp served as the first stage of selection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo was merely one among them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">His gaze swept across the scene, revealing at least fifty cultivators wading through the swamp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Cautious by nature, Ning Zhuo paused to observe before proceeding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Most cultivators who entered the swamp found the mud reaching their ankles, while for some, it rose as high as their thighs. Pulling their legs free from the swamp proved arduous, as the mud exerted a powerful suction. A layer of gray mist constantly swirled around them, further intensifying the oppressive atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sweat beaded on the cultivators' foreheads, their expressions grave as they relentlessly channeled their spiritual energy, their physical stamina rapidly depleting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Several cultivators faced particularly dramatic predicaments. The moment their feet touched the swamp, the mud instantly engulfed them up to their waists or even chests! Only by frantically activating their magic treasures to shatter the mud and struggling desperately could they manage to escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Throughout this ordeal, the Sinking Karma Swamp seemed to come alive, clinging to the cultivators and attempting to drag them down into its depths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">As Ning Zhuo observed, more than half of these cultivators were eliminated. Crying out for help, they were teleported away by the Demon Subjugation Hall cultivators on the Stone Platform, who activated the Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">A handful of other cultivators - so few they could be counted on one hand - moved with remarkable ease. Their feet trod firmly on the swamp's surface, the mud solidifying beneath their steps. They advanced steadily, leaving only shallow footprints in their wake, completely unaffected by the swamp's suction or attempts to drag them down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"The Sinking Karma Swamp's reaction is directly proportional to the weight of one's sins," Ning Zhuo murmured to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"The more sins a cultivator carries, the more treacherous the Sinking Karma Swamp becomes, capable of drowning them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Conversely, the fewer sins one bears, the more harmless the swamp becomes, transforming into a seemingly flat, solid surface!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo was no stranger to the Sinking Karma Swamp, having studied it extensively in books.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">What kind of performance will I exhibit? With this question in mind, Ning Zhuo took his first step onto the swamp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The swamp's surface instantly solidified beneath his foot, transforming into a solid brick!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">As Ning Zhuo continued forward, the ground remained firm and unyielding, leaving not even a footprint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This was truly walking on solid ground!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">There was no sinking, no suction, no resistance whatsoever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">While ordinary cultivators were shrouded in a layer of gray mist, Ning Zhuo's surroundings remained clear and pristine. He moved with effortless ease, strolling leisurely through the swamp, a stark contrast to the struggling cultivators around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Hmm?" After taking just a dozen steps, Ning Zhuo immediately drew the attention of numerous onlookers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">By the time he reached the midpoint, nearly all the high-level cultivators on the central Stone Platform Official Seal had their eyes fixed on him, scrutinizing him intently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Who is this young man?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"His cultivation is at the late Foundation Establishment stage, but he's young and shows great promise!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"It's rare to see a cultivator elicit such a reaction from the Sinking Karma Swamp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"The boy's gaze is clear and his bearing is dignified. He must have been nurtured by one of those ancient, Righteous Path sects with strict rules, where they spare no effort or resources to isolate their disciples from the world's turmoil!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The high-ranking cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall secretly communicated using their divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">One of them shook his head slightly. "It seems this boy hasn't experienced much bloody combat. His hands are remarkably clean. That's why the Sinking Karma Swamp reacted this way - no karmic debt from killing. Once we recruit him, we'll need to focus on developing his combat experience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Another cultivator countered, "While he may lack combat experience, the absence of even a wisp of gray mist around him proves his pure foundation and clear mind. Isn't this precisely the integrity we expect from a renowned Righteous Path sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The group showered Ning Zhuo with praise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Regardless of his innate talent, this performance alone warrants his admission to the Demon Subjugation Hall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Patience! The Sinking Karma Swamp is merely the first screening method, and its detection capabilities are limited. In past years, some Demonic Cultivators have used strange magic treasures or other means to conceal their sins and blood debts, allowing them to pass through the swamp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Indeed. Now, let's see how the youth performs under the Official Seal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The high-level cultivators secretly held Ning Zhuo in high regard, but outwardly, they quickly shifted their gazes away from him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo effortlessly overtook many cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Amidst envious, jealous, and resentful stares, he leisurely approached the central stone platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"This must be the easiest Rising Cloud Trial I've ever participated in," Ning Zhuo mused inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The high-level cultivators on the stone platform were already growing impatient. One elder couldn't help but urge, "The newcomer should ascend the platform."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Junior Ning Zhuo pays his respects to all seniors," Ning Zhuo said politely, bowing with clasped hands from below the platform before beginning his ascent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The cultivators on the platform nodded inwardly. "This lad knows his Rites. He must be from a prominent family. Good, good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">As Ning Zhuo climbed to the top of the platform, the elder who had spoken earlier continued to instruct, "Step forward and touch the Official Seal with your hand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo complied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">With a calm expression, he gently placed his palm on the surface of the Official Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The four large characters on the official seal, "The Clear Mirror Hangs High," began to emit a faint golden glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The high-ranking cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall exchanged surprised glances, communicating through divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"This youth actually possesses merit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"What good deeds has he performed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"His background must be deep, with a powerful family supporting him. It's no surprise he's done some charitable acts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"It's a pity the Hall Master isn't here. If our Master were present, he could fully activate the official seal to determine the exact extent of this young man's merit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"How much merit could someone so young possibly have? Perhaps his family arranged this for him to join the Demon Subjugation Hall, pulling strings behind the scenes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Let's see if he passes the Heart Inquiry first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, was examining the official seal, a hint of curiosity in his eyes. This is an official artifact?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The elderly cultivator spoke: "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, you have merit and no crimes. You have passed the second round of testing. Congratulations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"However, I still have three questions for you. You may answer or remain silent. But if you speak, you must speak from the heart. Do not deceive others, and above all, do not deceive yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Upon hearing these words, the faces of the cultivators closest to the stone platform paled, their expressions a mix of anxiety and anticipation, hoping to see Ning Zhuo stumble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The other high-ranking cultivators remained impassive, showing no surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo's performance in the Sinking Karma Swamp had earned him the right to undergo the Heart Inquiry by the Demon Subjugation Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo immediately clasped his hands in a respectful bow, his voice clear and resonant. "Thank you, Senior. Please ask whatever you wish."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He was well-versed in the relevant information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">This round of the Rising Cloud Trial served as the Demon Subjugation Hall's preliminary selection process, comprising two tests: the Sinking Karma Swamp and the Stone Platform Official Seal. Passing both would grant entry to the next round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">However, for exceptionally promising newcomers, the Demon Subjugation Hall would administer a third test: the Heart Inquiry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The elderly cultivator nodded slightly, a flicker of subtle approval in his eyes. He spoke slowly, his voice measured: "The Great Dao stretches vast and boundless, yet demonic fiends roam rampant. If you encounter vile demonic fiends who poison living beings, and you lack the strength to subdue them, so be it. But if you capture them, and they grovel for mercy, offering great rewards or pledging their usefulness as vanguard... how would you deal with them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">All eyes, both on and off the stage, focused on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Certain methods had already been activated. Ning Zhuo felt a faint tremor in his Upper Dantian Divine Sea, but the next moment, the Buddha Heart Demon Seal emitted waves of demonic light, sweeping through his divine sea and instantly stabilizing his dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo's mood was peculiar. He was somewhat surprised, as this was the first time he had witnessed the Buddha Heart Demon Seal passively activating and emitting demonic light. Previously, it had only ever emitted Buddhist Light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In that instant, he realized that the Demon Subjugation Hall's Heart Inquiry methods had become ineffective against him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
