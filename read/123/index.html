<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 123: Tiger Fight</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The Tree Martial Ape Dasheng was not incapable of casting spells.<br/>
<br/>
However, Yuan Dasheng's spirituality, carrying the traits from his previous life, had a strong aversion to spellcasting.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had to use the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique to harness the spiritual power within the mechanical body to cast techniques like the Embrace Ice Technique.<br/>
<br/>
"In fact, I can only use spells in one go."<br/>
<br/>
"Because the Three-Family Joint Renovation Team has not yet passed through Room No. 2, they haven't come into contact with the Embrace Ice Technique." Under such circumstances, Ning Zhuo should not reveal the Embrace Ice Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Only when the Three-Family Joint Renovation Team comes into contact with it, and he "learns" it publicly, can he use it openly and justifiably.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took out the Floating Cloud Cloak, covering himself and the desk.<br/>
<br/>
From the massive cloud-like cotton, occasional sounds of mechanism manufacturing could be heard.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was crafting the Blood Oil Bottle mechanism component!<br/>
<br/>
The specific blueprint was a reward from the third level of the Demon Gate.<br/>
<br/>
Using this mechanism component, various blood qi could be collected, mixed, processed, and refined to form an oil-like substance with the texture of blood.<br/>
<br/>
It works even better when paired with another mechanism component, the Blood Transformation Pool.<br/>
<br/>
"Yuan Dasheng had mastered the Demonic Blood Vein Technique in his previous life, and his cultivation was quite high." "Giving him blood qi would greatly enhance his combat power!" If the Demon Sect were still visible, Ning Zhuo would not reveal this mechanism component.<br/>
<br/>
But now, he had closed the stone wall, deeply hiding both the Buddhist Sect and the Pang Sect.<br/>
<br/>
This meant that others entering the central hall could not access the Buddhist and Demon paths, let alone claim related rewards.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the Blood Oil Bottle crafted by Ning Zhuo was not an exact replica but had been modified and altered by him, significantly reducing its effectiveness and changing its principles.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this was twofold: firstly, he had limited materials, and some high-quality materials were out of his reach.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, even if this item were exposed in the future, and the Lava Immortal Palace revealed the Blood Oil Bottle, Ning Zhuo would have some explanations and excuses to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Family cultivators guarded Ning Gui's residence.<br/>
<br/>
Foundation Establishment Stage divine senses scanned the area, and upon seeing the floating clouds, they refrained from unnecessary probing.<br/>
<br/>
They communicated via voice transmission, speculating on what mechanism Ning Zhuo was developing that required such secrecy.<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo has such talent in mechanisms; his future is limitless."<br/>
<br/>
"Indeed, it's been a long time since our branch lineage has produced such an outstanding junior."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm curious about what mechanism he's tinkering with now."<br/>
<br/>
"With so many floating clouds obstructing the view, isn't it inconvenient for his creation?"<br/>
<br/>
"Haha, geniuses always have their quirks. Besides, we all know Ning Zhuo's life story. He's lived alone for too long; this caution is a form of self-protection, a very good habit!"<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo's performance became increasingly exceptional, the expectations and tolerance of those around him also grew.<br/>
<br/>
That very night, Yuan Dasheng once again donned the Blue Iron Armor and proceeded through the sewer.<br/>
<br/>
He entered a specially designed path.<br/>
<br/>
The path was dark and eerie; Yuan Dasheng crawled through it until he reached the end.<br/>
<br/>
He activated a simple mechanism lever, causing the stone bricks before him to slide open, revealing a small door.<br/>
<br/>
The stone brick door opened halfway up an abandoned well.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng carefully inspected the surroundings, confirmed it was safe, and then climbed out of the well, entering an abandoned slum dwelling.<br/>
<br/>
He left a Jade Slip in the corner of the slum dwelling and then returned.<br/>
<br/>
This was one of the secret communication channels between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's covert manipulation aimed to inform Sun Lingtong to recruit more demonic cultivators and prepare to assassinate Yuan Er, staging a grand performance.<br/>
<br/>
The message in the Jade Slip was naturally written in a secret code created by Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo together.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Family.<br/>
<br/>
Four Golden Core Patriarchs were having a small gathering.<br/>
<br/>
One of the Golden Cores from the Zhou Family, discussing Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen, wore a troubled expression: "The Earth Yin Ant swarm contains Gu Worms, leaving behind Earth Yin Qi that is difficult to eradicate. Once the physical body recovers, it's like planting a root of illness, with far-reaching consequences." "Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen both have great talent. If the Earth Yin Qi lingers in their bodies for too long, it will turn their yang energy to yin, causing kidney water depletion, making them impotent and infertile. In severe cases, it will turn their yang energy to yin, making them neither yin nor yang."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangou snorted coldly: "Even so, it was too presumptuous of you two to try to take our family's Nine Yang Yellow Ox Paste by force."<br/>
<br/>
Another Golden Core from the Zhou Family bowed and saluted: "For the sake of our descendants, we as ancestors can only thicken our faces and come to ask for it."<br/>
<br/>
"I have a proposal."<br/>
<br/>
"Daoist Zheng Shuangou has long wanted to challenge our Night Star Sky Silk Formation."<br/>
<br/>
"Why don't my brother and I set up this formation, and let you two Daoists challenge it? If you are still trapped within the formation after three days and nights, please gift us the Nine Yang Yellow Ox Paste."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangdiao sneered: "And if we break through the formation?"<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou Family Patriarch smiled: "Then our Zhou Family will gift you the South Sky Vermilion Bird Constellation Diagram!"<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun was moved: "Really?"<br/>
<br/>
Another Zhou Family Patriarch: "We can swear an oath."<br/>
<br/>
The two Golden Cores from the Zheng Family transmitted their thoughts to each other, and after a moment, nodded in agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, the Zhou Family Patriarch took out a piece of silk brocade and spread it out.<br/>
<br/>
The surface of the silk brocade was smooth and dense, like flowing water, black as the deep night.<br/>
<br/>
In the deep ink color, faint starlight appeared and disappeared, flickering intermittently.<br/>
<br/>
The silk brocade floated into the air, quickly blending into the night, with no visible anomalies.<br/>
<br/>
The four Golden Cores from the Zhou and Zheng Families entered the formation and disappeared from sight.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji wandered among the mountains, constantly keeping an eye on the Wind Chime in his Divine Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Using Fire Persimmon Immortal City as the center, he continuously probed the surrounding areas.<br/>
<br/>
"Who goes there?" Suddenly, golden light burst from Zhu Xuanji's eyes as he looked towards a certain direction.<br/>
<br/>
He saw only a shadow, carrying a chilling ghostly aura, swiftly flying towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
"A Golden Core Cultivator! A Ghost Cultivator?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's expression immediately turned serious.<br/>
<br/>
To be able to contend with his Golden Eyes, the opponent must have an extraordinary background.<br/>
<br/>
Judging by the spiritual power aura alone, the cultivation technique was of high quality, likely from a major sect.<br/>
<br/>
At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Beast roars echoed continuously, magma surged and fluctuated.<br/>
<br/>
Various demonic beasts rioted, attempting to charge out from the Crimson Flame Demon Lava Cave, but were blocked by the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared incessantly from its throne.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace radiated with treasure light, and numerous mechanical puppets revived, forming a defensive line.<br/>
<br/>
This scene did not surprise Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
"My Mountain Watching Technique covers the entire Fire Persimmon Mountain."<br/>
<br/>
"The various demonic beasts within the mountain are naturally included. Those with weak fate energy are the first to be affected, those with moderate fate energy are swept away by the momentum, and those with the highest fate energy will eventually be implicated."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui sat amidst the clouds and smoke, standing in an invincible position, quietly watching the storm unfold.<br/>
<br/>
"I wonder if that Shadow Demon Cultivator will be drawn out?"<br/>
<br/>
Black Market.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had just returned to his courtyard when his eyes suddenly flashed with cold light, and he shouted: "Who goes there?!"<br/>
<br/>
Two black-clad demonic cultivators appeared simultaneously, one in front and one behind, looking very pleased.<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Lingtong, you are already in the formation, surrender obediently!"<br/>
<br/>
"In consideration of the Void Sect, as long as you reveal the whereabouts of Chui Zan Ke, we will spare your life."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's expression slightly tensed, recognizing them from their spiritual power aura: "You are... from the Soul Devouring Sect?!"<br/>
<br/>
"Spare him? Why?" Han Ming appeared from the shadows like a female ghost zombie, her face full of resentment and malice. "You dare to plot against me! Sun Lingtong, I want you dead!"<br/>
<br/>
"And that Chui Zan Ke!"<br/>
<br/>
"If you can betray him, I will grant you a quick death."</div>
