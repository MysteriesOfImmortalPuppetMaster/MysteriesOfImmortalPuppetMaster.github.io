<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 123: Tiger Fight</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Tree Martial Ape Dasheng was not incapable of casting spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">However, Yuan Dasheng's spirituality, carrying the traits from his previous life, had a strong aversion to spellcasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo had to use the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique to harness the spiritual power within the mechanical body to cast techniques like the Embrace Ice Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"In fact, I can only use spells in one go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Because the Three-Family Joint Renovation Team has not yet passed through Room No. 2, they haven't come into contact with the Embrace Ice Technique." Under such circumstances, Ning Zhuo should not reveal the Embrace Ice Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Only when the Three-Family Joint Renovation Team comes into contact with it, and he "learns" it publicly, can he use it openly and justifiably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo took out the Floating Cloud Cloak, covering himself and the desk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">From the massive cloud-like cotton, occasional sounds of mechanism manufacturing could be heard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo was crafting the Blood Oil Bottle mechanism component!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The specific blueprint was a reward from the third level of the Demon Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Using this mechanism component, various blood qi could be collected, mixed, processed, and refined to form an oil-like substance with the texture of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">It works even better when paired with another mechanism component, the Blood Transformation Pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Yuan Dasheng had mastered the Demonic Blood Vein Technique in his previous life, and his cultivation was quite high." "Giving him blood qi would greatly enhance his combat power!" If the Demon Sect were still visible, Ning Zhuo would not reveal this mechanism component.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But now, he had closed the stone wall, deeply hiding both the Buddhist Sect and the Pang Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">This meant that others entering the central hall could not access the Buddhist and Demon paths, let alone claim related rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Of course, the Blood Oil Bottle crafted by Ning Zhuo was not an exact replica but had been modified and altered by him, significantly reducing its effectiveness and changing its principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The reason for this was twofold: firstly, he had limited materials, and some high-quality materials were out of his reach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Secondly, even if this item were exposed in the future, and the Lava Immortal Palace revealed the Blood Oil Bottle, Ning Zhuo would have some explanations and excuses to offer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Family cultivators guarded Ning Gui's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Foundation Establishment Stage divine senses scanned the area, and upon seeing the floating clouds, they refrained from unnecessary probing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">They communicated via voice transmission, speculating on what mechanism Ning Zhuo was developing that required such secrecy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Young Master Ning Zhuo has such talent in mechanisms; his future is limitless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Indeed, it's been a long time since our branch lineage has produced such an outstanding junior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"I'm curious about what mechanism he's tinkering with now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"With so many floating clouds obstructing the view, isn't it inconvenient for his creation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Haha, geniuses always have their quirks. Besides, we all know Ning Zhuo's life story. He's lived alone for too long; this caution is a form of self-protection, a very good habit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">As Ning Zhuo's performance became increasingly exceptional, the expectations and tolerance of those around him also grew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">That very night, Yuan Dasheng once again donned the Blue Iron Armor and proceeded through the sewer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He entered a specially designed path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The path was dark and eerie; Yuan Dasheng crawled through it until he reached the end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He activated a simple mechanism lever, causing the stone bricks before him to slide open, revealing a small door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The stone brick door opened halfway up an abandoned well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Yuan Dasheng carefully inspected the surroundings, confirmed it was safe, and then climbed out of the well, entering an abandoned slum dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He left a Jade Slip in the corner of the slum dwelling and then returned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This was one of the secret communication channels between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo's covert manipulation aimed to inform Sun Lingtong to recruit more demonic cultivators and prepare to assassinate Yuan Er, staging a grand performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The message in the Jade Slip was naturally written in a secret code created by Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zheng Family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Four Golden Core Patriarchs were having a small gathering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">One of the Golden Cores from the Zhou Family, discussing Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen, wore a troubled expression: "The Earth Yin Ant swarm contains Gu Worms, leaving behind Earth Yin Qi that is difficult to eradicate. Once the physical body recovers, it's like planting a root of illness, with far-reaching consequences." "Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen both have great talent. If the Earth Yin Qi lingers in their bodies for too long, it will turn their yang energy to yin, causing kidney water depletion, making them impotent and infertile. In severe cases, it will turn their yang energy to yin, making them neither yin nor yang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zheng Shuangou snorted coldly: "Even so, it was too presumptuous of you two to try to take our family's Nine Yang Yellow Ox Paste by force."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Another Golden Core from the Zhou Family bowed and saluted: "For the sake of our descendants, we as ancestors can only thicken our faces and come to ask for it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"I have a proposal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Daoist Zheng Shuangou has long wanted to challenge our Night Star Sky Silk Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Why don't my brother and I set up this formation, and let you two Daoists challenge it? If you are still trapped within the formation after three days and nights, please gift us the Nine Yang Yellow Ox Paste."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zheng Shuangdiao sneered: "And if we break through the formation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Zhou Family Patriarch smiled: "Then our Zhou Family will gift you the South Sky Vermilion Bird Constellation Diagram!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Zheng Shuangjun was moved: "Really?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Another Zhou Family Patriarch: "We can swear an oath."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The two Golden Cores from the Zheng Family transmitted their thoughts to each other, and after a moment, nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Immediately, the Zhou Family Patriarch took out a piece of silk brocade and spread it out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The surface of the silk brocade was smooth and dense, like flowing water, black as the deep night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In the deep ink color, faint starlight appeared and disappeared, flickering intermittently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The silk brocade floated into the air, quickly blending into the night, with no visible anomalies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The four Golden Cores from the Zhou and Zheng Families entered the formation and disappeared from sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhu Xuanji wandered among the mountains, constantly keeping an eye on the Wind Chime in his Divine Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Using Fire Persimmon Immortal City as the center, he continuously probed the surrounding areas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Who goes there?" Suddenly, golden light burst from Zhu Xuanji's eyes as he looked towards a certain direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He saw only a shadow, carrying a chilling ghostly aura, swiftly flying towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"A Golden Core Cultivator! A Ghost Cultivator?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Zhu Xuanji's expression immediately turned serious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">To be able to contend with his Golden Eyes, the opponent must have an extraordinary background.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Judging by the spiritual power aura alone, the cultivation technique was of high quality, likely from a major sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">At the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Beast roars echoed continuously, magma surged and fluctuated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Various demonic beasts rioted, attempting to charge out from the Crimson Flame Demon Lava Cave, but were blocked by the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared incessantly from its throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Lava Immortal Palace radiated with treasure light, and numerous mechanical puppets revived, forming a defensive line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This scene did not surprise Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"My Mountain Watching Technique covers the entire Fire Persimmon Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"The various demonic beasts within the mountain are naturally included. Those with weak fate energy are the first to be affected, those with moderate fate energy are swept away by the momentum, and those with the highest fate energy will eventually be implicated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Meng Kui sat amidst the clouds and smoke, standing in an invincible position, quietly watching the storm unfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"I wonder if that Shadow Demon Cultivator will be drawn out?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Black Market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong had just returned to his courtyard when his eyes suddenly flashed with cold light, and he shouted: "Who goes there?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Two black-clad demonic cultivators appeared simultaneously, one in front and one behind, looking very pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Sun Lingtong, you are already in the formation, surrender obediently!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"In consideration of the Void Sect, as long as you reveal the whereabouts of Chui Zan Ke, we will spare your life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Sun Lingtong's expression slightly tensed, recognizing them from their spiritual power aura: "You are... from the Soul Devouring Sect?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Spare him? Why?" Han Ming appeared from the shadows like a female ghost zombie, her face full of resentment and malice. "You dare to plot against me! Sun Lingtong, I want you dead!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"And that Chui Zan Ke!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"If you can betray him, I will grant you a quick death."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
