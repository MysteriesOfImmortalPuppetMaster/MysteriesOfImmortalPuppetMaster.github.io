<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">On the stage, the sound of creaking echoed as the background buildings slowly collapsed, transitioning to the next scene. The audience remained silent, fully immersed in the performance. Only a few musicians, while playing their instruments, couldn't help but glance at the highest level of the stage where Ning Zhuo stood. They were astonished by this young cultivator's skillful manipulation, almost indistinguishable from Li Leifeng when he was alive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo's eyes sparkled, and sweat covered his entire body. Taking advantage of the transition between scenes, he communicated with the dragon turtle fire spirit through the Life Hanging by a Thread: "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit! I'm outside the Immortal Palace, and influencing Ning Xiaohui to this extent through the Life Hanging by a Thread is my limit. From here on, it's up to you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The dragon turtle fire spirit roared anxiously: "No, Young Master Ning Zhuo. My authority is restricted, I can't..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Before it could finish, Ning Zhuo interrupted: "Sorry, the next scene is about to start. I'm barely holding on myself. You must win over there at the Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The dragon turtle fire spirit: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">……</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The stage was set up as the residence of a powerful minister, with dim lighting. The sound of the jinghu was continuous and low. The minister puppet lay on the bed, listening quietly to the black-clad messenger puppet's report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The black-clad messenger sang: "My lord, I have persuaded the commoner to falsely accuse the judge. Tomorrow, he will be publicly accused, bringing great shame. The judge is upright and will not tolerate this. Kill the commoner, and he will fall into the trap."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The minister puppet, dressed in official robes, lay on the bed with his legs crossed, his head slightly turning, vividly lifelike. He sang triumphantly: "Well done, excellently done. Tomorrow's situation is set. The judge has fallen into the trap and will find it hard to defend himself. His righteous reputation will be ruined in an instant. Let's see how he stands in court again! Hahaha." The minister laughed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The lights dimmed, and the jinghu turned high-pitched. The stage creaked again as the scene changed, and Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, his eyes flickering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The third act ended, and the fourth act began. The stage returned to the courtroom, brightly lit. The jinghu was urgent, and drums and gongs resounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The judge puppet sat in the official's seat, striking the gavel, and sang: "Today, we re-examine, the mirror before the court. Who is the real culprit, let it be clearly stated." The criminal puppet knelt below, raising his head several times, each time accompanied by a drumbeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Finally, he mustered the courage, shouted excitedly, and sang: "Judge, you false judge, greedy and corrupt, harming the people. The so-called real culprit is you, killing me to silence, your crime is immense!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Clang, clang, clang! The sound of gongs tugged at the audience's heartstrings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The judge puppet stood up in shock. The jinghu turned sharply, and the judge suppressed his anger, singing: "Shameless scoundrel, daring to falsely accuse! Audacious, recklessly framing!" He took a deep breath: "If I were to exercise my power today, it would be easy to execute you, but I am unwilling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Justice must be served through trial, I shall first examine myself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Immediately, the judge sat down slowly, playing both roles, ultimately declaring himself suspicious and temporarily imprisoning himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"My lord!" The constables in the court exclaimed at such a verdict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"My lord!" The puppet citizens outside the court exclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The judge bound his hands, held his head high, and led the constables away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The lights dimmed, leaving only the criminal puppet in a spotlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"My lord..." The criminal puppet lamented, crying with tears streaming down his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Xiaohui was on the verge of tears!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">She ran frantically on the chaotic battlefield, using every means at her disposal to fight for her life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Save me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Can anyone save me!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">She kept calling for help, screaming desperately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Several times, she was on the brink of life and death. Her innate Ice Jade Hand still performed admirably at this moment, allowing Ning Xiaohui to survive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The attention of the golden core cultivators was no longer on her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Because a massive wave of Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts was about to overwhelm the Historical Records Pavilion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The three golden core cultivators, along with Zhu Zhen, had been solemnly instructed by Zhu Xuanji beforehand - the Historical Records Pavilion was extremely important and must not be lost!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Compared to the Historical Records Pavilion, Ning Xiaohui was not as important. Especially since Ning Xiaohui had told the Moon Hook Avatar that she hadn't had time to browse the materials in the Historical Records Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Boom, boom, boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Golden core-level spells continuously bombarded, tearing the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts apart, leaving them dead and unable to rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">But there were too many Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts, endlessly replenishing, like an unending tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Damn it, we have to protect the Historical Records Pavilion, but we're tied down! We can't exert our full strength!" "We must quickly seal the breach in the spherical barrier, or the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts will never stop." "Damn, the hole in the barrier seems to be getting bigger!" The golden core cultivators communicated with each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Thanks to their efforts to protect the Historical Records Pavilion, Yang Chanyu also survived by luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">She shrank to the side, fully focused on removing the marks others had planted on her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The dragon turtle fire spirit couldn't directly harm Ning Xiaohui, so it commanded the mechanical constructs to drive the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts towards Ning Xiaohui as much as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">But the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were unruly, often choosing to fight the puppet army to the death, making it difficult to drive them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the face of life and death, Ning Xiaohui unleashed her full potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">She charged into a weak spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Turning a corner, suddenly, her vision opened up, and she arrived at the Gourd Furnace Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This wasn't Ning Xiaohui's first time here; she had completed many artifact refining tasks here before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The familiar scene gave Ning Xiaohui a sense of safety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">A Foundation Establishment Scarlet Flame Demon Beast spotted her and lunged at her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Xiaohui fled swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">She instinctively entered the furnace forest, and seeing the Scarlet Flame Demon Beast about to catch up, in desperation, she chose a silver furnace, opened the door, and jumped inside!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Bang, bang, bang...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Scarlet Flame Demon Beast attacked the furnace madly from outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Xiaohui held the furnace door tightly and used her Ice Jade Hand to create ice blocks, sealing the door's gaps and reinforcing it strongly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Xiaohui was on edge for a while until the Scarlet Flame Demon Beast gave up and left, allowing her to relax.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Ugh..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">She sat down, overwhelmed by the joy of survival, fear, and other emotions, causing her to cover her face and cry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The criminal puppet was also crying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">On the stage, the fifth act had already begun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The judge’s choices and actions completely moved the criminal puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Both were imprisoned, separated by a corridor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The criminal confessed, revealing the entire truth to the judge, exposing the treacherous minister, and expressing his willingness to confess and accept punishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The judge sighed deeply and sang: "A prodigal son returns, worth more than gold, recognizing oneself, a pure heart untroubled." "You have confessed, sincerely repented, this world will surely embrace you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Do not lose your true self, regroup, walk the righteous path, your life has been renewed!" Ning Zhuo was touched to the core!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He understood Zhu Xuanji's intention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zhu Xuanji advised him to surrender and walk the righteous path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Can I really walk this path?" Ning Zhuo asked himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">His eyes flickered, showing hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The puppet show continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The puppet citizens gathered, waving flags and shouting, pleading for the judge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The puppet playing the deity was also moved, descending voluntarily to meet the king.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The matter escalated, known throughout the nation, and the king decided to personally adjudicate the case.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The treacherous minister, upon learning this, immediately sent a black-clad messenger to kill the criminal in prison, leaving no evidence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The minister also actively fabricated charges, fully framing the judge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The sixth act began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">In the Golden Luan Hall, the judge and the minister confronted each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The minister was well-prepared, and the judge was at a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The king, already prepared, clapped his hands and summoned the Pure Flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">This was one of the seven great flames, capable of burning away falsehoods and discerning truth to some extent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The king sang: "You two are in dispute, let the fire judge. Who is true, who is false, will be clear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The minister hesitated, singing: "Proving oneself in fire is perilous. Rumors may not be accurate..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Unexpectedly, the judge leaped into the fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">At this point, the opera reached its climax!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The jinghu turned sharply, drums thundered, and the audience held their breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">On the stage, the white flame with a clear light enveloped the judge puppet, burning fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Such a special flame made the judge extremely prominent and eye-catching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">At this moment, he was the sole protagonist on the stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The judge sang loudly in the fire!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"If I am to clear this injustice, let the fierce flames sever falsehoods." "My heart is open, without shame to heaven and earth, unafraid of life and death, unafraid of fire's blaze!" "This is-"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"This heart is open to the sun and moon," "I'd rather be pure and white, even if it costs a meal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Life and death are but fleeting matters," "The original intention remains unchanged for all eternity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">On the stage, the flames blazed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The blue-white flames illuminated Ning Zhuo's face, and for a moment, he was somewhat entranced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">In the Lava Immortal Palace, within the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The dragon turtle fire spirit's massive body pressed against the door and ceiling, its firelight illuminating every corner of the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">It roared, it shouted, it called out to Ning Zhuo: "Young Master! Young Master!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">On the battlefield surrounding the Historical Records Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The firelight from the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts reflected on the golden core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The chaotic battle continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The golden core cultivators formed a tight defensive line, and the battle reached a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zhu Xuanji stood by the window, overlooking Ning Zhuo on the stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Ning Zhuo, don't disappoint me!" The golden light in his eyes represented his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered, and he couldn't help but think - perhaps he could also cleanse his sins in this Pure Flame!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He wouldn't need to hide or bear such a heavy burden; he could walk proudly in the light. He would walk with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He sat on the high platform, looking at the audience below, seeing everything clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Is this the perspective of the late Li Leifeng? No wonder he could discover the young me." "Now, I have also reached this position."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Perhaps, I can stay here, in this bright and beautiful place..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Hmm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo's expression changed slightly, and in a trance, he saw his former self.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">As if crossing over a decade of time, the current Ning Zhuo saw the past Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">That small figure hid in a dark corner, drooling over the guests' pastries. Whenever someone glanced over, he would instinctively hunch his shoulders and lower his head. Like, like... a thief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo squinted his eyes, looking carefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">In a trance, the child's face wasn't his but Sun Lingtong's!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">A memory surged in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo sneaked into the prison and rescued Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Boss, you failed again this time." Ning Zhuo said with a wry smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Sun Lingtong chuckled: "Ah, got caught. Thanks, little brother!" Ning Zhuo shook his head: "Why do you always have to steal? We have money now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Sun Lingtong used his hand as a pillow, swaggering out of the carriage, saying as he walked: "I'm a thief, if I don't steal, what do I do?" Ning Zhuo continued shaking his head, not understanding: "Even if you steal, there's no need to seal your cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Sun Lingtong said: "Don't you find it thrilling?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"I'm already at the Foundation Establishment stage, with my true strength, unless it's those at the golden core level, stealing from others is no challenge." "So, I have to seal my cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"This peaceful life is really hard to bear, I need some challenges to keep me from getting bored!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">At this point, Sun Lingtong stopped, looked at Ning Zhuo, and said seriously: "You understand, right? You're just like me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows and exclaimed: "How could I?! Such reckless actions are simply foolish." "Ah, you actually called me foolish, boss?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo quickly waved his hand: "I accidentally spoke my mind, ah, no, boss, boss, let me explain!" Sun Lingtong leaped up, shouting: "Take this, you brat!" Another scene from memory surfaced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Under the moonlight, two youths washed their hands by a small river in the Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">That was the first time Ning Zhuo took a life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The blood flowed down the river, quickly diluted, and by the time it reached the stone bridge forty steps away, it was almost invisible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Sun Lingtong told him: "Every time I go out to steal, I tell myself before the action, this time I might not come back, I might die." "If this is the result of my life's gamble, I accept it." "I'm always ready to accept my death, even in the next second." "This is my resolve!" "What about your resolve?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The leaves on both sides of the river rustled in the night wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The silver-white moonlight reflected on the river, creating ripples like countless tiny diamonds dancing on the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The river's shimmering light rippled in Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">When he came back to his senses, he was still sitting high on the stage, below were countless cultivators and elites, and the judge puppet was still bathed in the Pure Flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Silent tears flowed down Ning Zhuo's cheeks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Oh?" Zhu Xuanji keenly noticed this scene, revealing a trace of satisfaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Ning Zhuo! Ning Zhuo!!" The dragon turtle fire spirit roared in Ning Zhuo's ear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Strangely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">He had completely blocked out this voice just now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">But in fact, he had heard all the dragon turtle fire spirit's roars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The dragon turtle fire spirit told Ning Zhuo everything happening in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"Brother Sun." Ning Zhuo communicated with Sun Lingtong through the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Sun Lingtong was pleasantly surprised: "Little brother, you finally made a move!" "The battlefield situation is like this..." Ning Zhuo interrupted him: "I know." Sun Lingtong: "Shall we act?" Ning Zhuo: "Boss, thank you." Sun Lingtong: "What?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo smiled silently: "I mean, let's act." Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up: "Alright!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Inside the furnace, Ning Xiaohui gradually calmed down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"I'm not dead, I survived!" "Hehehe, hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"The dragon turtle fire spirit ultimately has limitations, it can only use external forces, it can't directly kill me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"After this, I'll go to the golden core ancestor for help, I'll expose the dragon turtle fire spirit, I'll expose Ning Zhuo!" "I want... what is this?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Poof.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">A soft sound, and flames suddenly ignited inside the furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Ning Xiaohui's pupils shrank to needlepoints!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">She quickly dodged, rushing towards the furnace door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">She pushed with all her might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The furnace door didn't budge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Faintly, the chanting of Buddhist scriptures could be heard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"Who, who is outside?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">The temperature rose rapidly, the inside of the furnace turning crimson.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">"Spare me, spare me, I beg you, spare my life." "I'll give you anything you want!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">"I can't die, I've discovered the truth." "I don't want to die, I really don't want to die!!" Ning Xiaohui wailed in despair, struggling desperately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">She fully activated her innate Ice Jade Hand, creating massive ice blocks inside the furnace, barely holding on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">At the Historical Records Pavilion, the situation reached a critical moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">The mechanical constructs drove the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts with all their might, forming a frenzy that overwhelmed the golden core cultivators' formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">The formation shielded the Historical Records Pavilion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">"Young Master Ning Zhuo, now is the time!" The dragon turtle fire spirit roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Ning Zhuo's gaze was cold as he performed his duty as the tower master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">The Five Elements Cannon Tower rose again, and after gathering power, it fired a shot, hitting the mountain of demon beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">The ineffective demon beasts perished, turning to ash in the explosion of the Five Elements Mana-formed cannonball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">The formation shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">"We can't hold it anymore!" "We can't hold it!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">"Retreat quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">The golden core cultivators had no choice but to retreat for their safety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">Boom, boom, boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Continuous cannon fire covered the formation, covered the Historical Records Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">The Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were almost wiped out, and the former site of the Historical Records Pavilion had become ruins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">What historical records?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">Not a trace remained!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">"I succeeded!!" The dragon turtle fire spirit howled in excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">The next moment, a guillotine formed of flames descended from the sky, slicing along its neck, severing its dragon head directly!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="349">In the Gourd Furnace Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="351">Under the terrifying high temperature, the ice blocks created by the Ice Jade Hand lasted only a dozen breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="353">Ning Xiaohui's body turned to ash in the flames, leaving behind traces of spirituality, like fireflies dancing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
