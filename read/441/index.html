<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 441: Who Is the Main General?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Several Golden Core cultivators attacked together. Even though they encountered interception, only more than thirty cultivators were killed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Such a meager result was pitiful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This was because the Three Generals Camp was an official army unit of the Two Note Kingdom, part of the national defense, enjoying the blessing of national power. Any external attack would inevitably be weakened by the national defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Moreover, the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp had always been in formation, marching in a straight-line snake formation. Their military strength was condensed and unified, giving them certain defensive capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">But when Liu Er, Guan Hei, and others saw such losses, they shouted in shock and anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Three Generals Camp was not large in scale, with only more than three hundred people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In the first round of attacks, they lost ten percent. If they suffered two or three more rounds, the morale would collapse, and the army would scatter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This army was not the Golden Halberd Army; it was newly formed and had the weakest foundation among all armies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">As long as casualties reached around thirty percent, the cultivators would become terrified and flee in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Describing them as a mob was very appropriate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Change formation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Change formation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Liu Er and Guan Hei shouted simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">On the other side, Guan Hong gritted his teeth, enduring severe pain. He had just swallowed a pill to stabilize his injuries and hastily bandaged his right arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">His right arm was severely injured, almost useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But at this time, the army was under attack. Hearing the divine sense transmissions from Liu Er and Guan Hei, he knew he had to hold on!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Guan Hong mobilized his magic power, coordinating with Liu Er and Zhang Hei, directing the surrounding soldiers to begin changing formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The straight-line snake formation was very suitable for marching, but when used to deal with a small number of elite enemies, the formation line was too long, with the head and tail far apart, making it difficult to take care of both ends.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Fortunately, the three generals had undergone extremely arduous special training before, mainly practicing two battle formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The straight-line snake formation was practiced later; they spent most of their energy and time on the triangular arrow formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The soldiers of the Three Generals Camp felt numbness on their scalps but followed orders one after another, urgently maneuvering according to their usual training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">They still retained their rationality, knowing that as Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators, if they scattered and fled, they would surely be slaughtered by Golden Core cultivators, with heads rolling and no chance of survival. Instead, forming a formation could rely on the battle formation and national defense for self-protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">If they were lucky enough to repel the attacking Golden Core cultivators, they could even earn some military merit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">In no time, the long snake turned its head and curled its tail among the mountains, coiling into a group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Quick, attack them!" Chen Lingfeng hurriedly transmitted his thoughts, giving commands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Changing formations was a matter of skill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Rashly changing formations would create flaws.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Referring to when the White Jade Camp dealt with Tu Ming, Shuang Jing commanded the battle. During the change of formation, only the inner elite soldiers and personal guards changed formation, while the outer layer still maintained the Jade Wall Heavenly Barrier Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This was to cover up the flaws during the change of formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But the Three Generals Camp couldn't do this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">On one hand, the Three Generals Camp had too few people, only about three hundred, unable to form two sets of battle formations inside and outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">On the other hand, their training was insufficient. This defect of the Three Generals Camp was even greater than that of the Barbarian Demon Camp! Xu Dali of the Barbarian Demon Camp at least had his own personal guards and elite soldiers, but the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang were all alone, starting from scratch to build the army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Fortunately, the enemies they faced at this time were not as many or as strong as those of the Barbarian Demon Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Wind Movement Spell â€”Wind Like Dusk!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Chen Lingfeng flapped the wings on his back, utilizing his talent, and cast a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">In an instant, heaven and earth dimmed, and a fierce wind swept through, causing the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp to be unable to open their eyes. Some even couldn't stand, their bodies swaying, almost being blown away by the gale!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Wu Hen had fled to a safe area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"I'm joining in!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ghostly Dao â€”Shadow Silk Ensnarement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">From the edges of Wu Hen's black robe, black shadows frantically emanated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The black shadows surged like a layer of pitch-black tide, clinging to the ground, attacking the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The soldiers were gathered together, their figures connected into patches, which made it very convenient for Wu Hen to attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Liu Er shouted loudly; in the dim gale, he rode on a yellow steed, raising the Xuanhuang Sword high!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Military Tactic â€”Defend the Land and Strengthen the Foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">This was a tactic inherent in the Xuanhuang Sword. When activated, it immediately turned into earth-yellow halos, blessing each soldier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The halos rapidly spread, covering the entire army, forming a strong defense against the blowing gale, but they couldn't withstand the tide of black shadows rushing along the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Got you," Wu Hen grinned, letting out a chilling sinister smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This was the advantage of the Ghostly Dao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Wu Hen was unhindered and made contact with the soldiers of the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">In the next moment, the shadows of the soldiers touched by Wu Hen rebelled one after another, turning into strands of shadow silk, rising from the ground, entangling their owners' legs and arms, restricting their movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">For a moment, the speed of changing formation slowed down considerably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Many soldiers fell to the ground, struggling frantically but unable to break free from the bindings of the shadow silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Some, in their impatience, cast spells or used magical artifacts to attack their own shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">As a result, along with the damage to their shadows, corresponding injuries appeared on their bodies!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This put them in a dilemma, feeling quite helpless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Very good, very good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Another Golden Core cultivator, named Luo Xiwei, practiced the Earth Element cultivation method "Earth Penetration Technique", adept at digging tunnels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">According to the previous arrangement, he then made his move, holding the magical artifact Earth Vein Five-Section Staff, casting Earth Element spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">In an instant, the mountainous terrain changed, rapidly softening and loosening from solid rocky ground, eventually turning into vast areas of quicksand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The soldiers of the Three Generals Camp were already entangled and bound by shadow silk, unable to move, and could only watch helplessly as they were swallowed by the quicksand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">This quicksand move was quite vicious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">It wouldn't kill the soldiers immediately but would let them watch themselves sliding into the abyss of death, greatly shocking their fighting spirit, thereby shaking the entire army's morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">They had weapons that each contained a military tactic, but all were used for offense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"How hateful," Liu Er was extremely anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Generals Guan and Zhang also gnashed their teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Now, the triangular arrow formation required the three generals as the core to maintain. If any one of them rushed out to kill the enemy, it would inevitably cause one corner of the battle formation to collapse, and the resulting flaw would be so great that the other Golden Core cultivators could take the opportunity to attack fiercely, killing a large number of soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The three generals naturally did not want to see this scene; after all, this was their only foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But the defense of the triangular arrow formation itself was not outstanding; if this continued, with continuous losses, it would collapse sooner or later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhang Hei shuddered, thought of something, and couldn't help but transmit via divine sense, shouting, "Eldest Brother, Second Brother, isn't this the prophecy poem calculated by the military advisor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">That prophecy poem:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Hooves trample falling flowers; wind rises, shadows sink into sand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Who can retain the bright moon? Who will be buried among the rosy clouds?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">The current situation corresponded exactly to the line "wind rises, shadows sink into sand," fitting incomparably!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Liu Er and Guan Hong had actually already thought of this and hurriedly transmitted, urging Zhang Hei not to speak recklessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Now the army's morale was already violently shaken; the three generals were struggling to hold on. If they themselves panicked, the battle would completely collapse, irretrievable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Zhang Hei held his tongue, thinking to himself with deep regret, "Had I known, I should have heeded the military advisor's words more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Ning Zhuo's divine sense penetrated the carriage, observing the battlefield. Seeing this scene, he felt a strange emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">"A prophecy poem I randomly made up actually matched the situation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">"What's going on?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">"It must be a coincidence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">At this moment, he hadn't guessed that this was the plan proposed by Cave Master Mo Yuan, turning their trick against them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">This plan was indeed ingenious; even though the three generals did not spread it, their own hearts were already shaken because of it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">They were the foundation of maintaining the army's morale; once their hearts were in turmoil, it immediately affected the power of the entire battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">The attacking Golden Core cultivators felt much more at ease, and the soldiers sank into the quicksand even faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">"Is our army going to be annihilated today?!" Liu Er couldn't help but feel despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">"If we're going to be destroyed sooner or later, we might as well rush out now and fight to the death!" Zhang Hei gritted his teeth, eyes showing ferocity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Guan Hong's face was cold: "Since we can't change the situation, we might as well take a risk and charge once."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">If they did this, the number of casualties among the soldiers would probably be enormous, but the three generals seemed to have no other choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">"Generals, don't worry, watch me display my methods." At the critical moment, a young cultivator stepped out of the carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">To his right was the Heavy Armored Blood Ape, Da Sheng; to his left was the Buddhist Physician, Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">It was Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">The mechanical dragon on Ning Zhuo's waist was no longer there; Sun Lingtong had quietly left the army long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Ning Zhuo took out his own Military Advisor's Small Seal, multitasking, activating the seal while casting spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Earth Element â€”Binding Sand and Solidifying Earth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">He was an official Military Advisor Libationer, enjoying the national defense blessing of the Two Note Kingdom and the enhancement of the triangular arrow formation. The battle formation itself could enhance the offensive, making his spells extremely sharp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Immediately, centered on Ning Zhuo, a yellow wind rose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Where the yellow wind blew, the flowing sand solidified, restoring into solid ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">The Golden Core cultivator Luo Xiwei had to resist the national defense; the actual power of his spells had already been greatly reduced. He had been casting spell attacks for a while and was suffering from national prestige backlash, his combat power rapidly declining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">In contrast, Ning Zhuo was getting blessings, like a fish in water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Between the ebb and flow, Ning Zhuo's spells kept winning, causing Luo Xiwei's spells to retreat step by step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">After a moment, the ground of the Three Generals Camp had been restored!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">"It's that Ning Zhuo!" Chen Lingfeng looked down from above, overlooking the battlefield. Seeing this scene, he felt some resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">"Wu Hen chose wrongly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">"He attacked the three generals but didn't manage to kill even one. It would have been better to focus his strength on dealing with Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Luo Xiwei also felt it was a pity: "I was about to succeed! I didn't expect Ning Zhuo to have mastered a spell specifically targeting mine; his luck is too good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">He didn't know that Ning Zhuo had observed for a moment, learned the principles of his quicksand spell, and then reversed it, creating an improvised usage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">"It's him!" Wu Hen saw Ning Zhuo, his heart stirred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">When he had infiltrated the carriage and saw Ning Zhuo for the first time, he had a premonition that this young cultivator would be trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Now, his premonition had come true!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Wu Hen's five fingers suddenly clenched inward; countless shadow silks were pulled by him, attacking Ning Zhuo from all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">"Protect the military advisor!" Liu Er shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Without a doubt, Ning Zhuo was the key to their defense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Guan Hong was at a farther position; Zhang Hei had already set off, rushing towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Facing thousands of shadow silks, Ning Zhuo stood firm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">The Buddhist Physician, Meng Yaoyin, lightly swung her arm; the mechanical sickle swept in a circle in the air, then gracefully paused, returning to its original position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">"Swish!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Like the sound of waves crashing against rocks, the thousands of shadow silks disintegrated and collapsed completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Wu Hen's body trembled, his face changed drastically, blood oozing from his mouth and nose: "What a powerful Night Rain Demon Soldier!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">The three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang, who witnessed this scene, also felt their hearts tremble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Zhang Hei, being the closest, even felt a chill on his neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">The three generals were greatly shocked, thinking that their military advisor actually possessed such a powerful Golden Core combat strength!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">"He seems even stronger than me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">"This... who is the main general?" Liu Er felt both joy and a hint of absurdity.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
