<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"There must be more to the Primordial Resonance Reed Book than what's written here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"This book describes twenty vowel reeds, but these are just the basics. There should also be auxiliary reeds."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"The number of auxiliary reeds likely exceeds twenty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Perhaps the next time I pass Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Minor Trial, I'll receive a Consonant Reed Book?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo speculated inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Primordial Resonance Reed Book in his hands was written by Qing Huangzi himself, thus imbued with the author's intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Intent is information that cannot be expressed through words or sentences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Yet, through the Intent Comprehension Brush, Ning Zhuo could perceive it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">As the author, Qing Huangzi had only recorded a fraction of his complete legacy. Clearly, the Primordial Resonance Reed Book represented the most fundamental of foundations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He hadn't explicitly written about the subsequent stages, but Ning Zhuo could glimpse the later content through the intent embedded within the text.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"The Luoshu Page, as a Dao Artifact, has also been immensely helpful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Under its influence, I've been able to stay on the right path, correctly interpreting this intent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The results of this experiment felt like a window had been opened for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">A glint flashed in his eyes as he quickly realized, "If I want to uncover the fundamental cultivation technique of a Great Power cultivator, could I also study their other authentic works, decipher their intent, and thereby glean the secrets of their cultivation art?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment, then shook his head slightly. "This won't be easy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"At the very least, these authentic works must be related to the fundamental cultivation technique. Otherwise, the intent left by the Great Power cultivator when writing would pertain to other matters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Wait a minute..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Many cultivators observe battlefields, studying the sword marks and lightning traces left by clashes between Great Powers, often gaining insights."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Isn't this the same principle as using the Intent Comprehension Brush?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Realizing this, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but exclaim sincerely, "There are truly endless avenues to learning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Knowledge knows no bounds!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo placed the Intent Comprehension Brush back into its box to continue nurturing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The recent tracing had dimmed the brush's luster once more. Using it again now might damage its core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Alas, I'm not a Confucian cultivator, lacking a Literary Heart and Literary Qi. This means I can't use the Intent Comprehension Brush for long periods at a time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"If only I had multiple Intent Comprehension Brushes to rotate between them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Before beginning his daily cultivation routine, Ning Zhuo summoned Gongsun Yan and handed him a list of materials, instructing him to go out and purchase them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Although Qing Huangzi hadn't explicitly stated it, now that Ning Zhuo possessed the Primordial Resonance Reed Book, he naturally needed to refine more of its mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ban Ji swung his arm, unleashing a surge of spiritual energy that shattered the last flowerpot in his cave dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The cave was already in ruins, the result of Ban Ji's unrestrained use of spiritual energy to vent his rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Ning Zhuo, I'll kill you! I'll kill you!" Ban Ji snarled through gritted teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He had prepared for Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Minor Trial for a long time, only to be eliminated in the first round!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Without a doubt, it was all Ning Zhuo's fault!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"But it's also my own fault!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"I was too careless! My overwhelming advantage in the divine sense clash made me complacent! If I had noticed earlier that Ning Zhuo was colluding with others and taken precautions, I would still have had a chance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Slap! Slap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ban Ji slapped himself twice, his cheeks quickly swelling and reddening. His eyes were bloodshot, his hair disheveled, and his expression twisted with fury, radiating an aura of madness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Only one! The pain in his swollen cheeks was nothing compared to the agony in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Qing Huangzi had deliberately spread word of the competition to attract more cultivators, hoping to filter out the most outstanding successor. Ban Ji had been preparing for this moment since he first heard the rumors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He had prepared extensively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"I've even deduced and summarized the reed structures for all Forty-Eight Tones!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"The winners of this round received the Primordial Resonance Reed Book, which only contains twenty types of reeds. There must be further volumes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"If I can just pass the first round and maintain my eligibility, I'll have an overwhelming advantage in the subsequent trials!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">But it was all for naught. Ban Ji was eliminated in the very first round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">For him, the psychological blow was devastating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">This failure only intensified his sense of humiliation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Aaaah!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"It's all your fault, Ning Zhuo! You deserve to die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Human Tribulation? I'll crush you directly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ban Ji roared, and suddenly the jade pendant hanging around his neck emitted a surge of green light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The light flowed like water, rapidly coursing through Ban Ji's entire body before converging in his divine sea, jolting him awake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The fury on Ban Ji's face vanished, replaced by a look of terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"That was close! I almost succumbed to demonic possession!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">This was a hallmark of Demonic Arts - extreme, rapid cultivation, and inherent instability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ban Ji's Demonic Art, the Greedy Opportunity Demonic Heart Art, focused on cultivating the Upper Dantian's divine sea. This made him prone to emotional outbursts and prone to extreme thinking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ban Ji gasped for breath, his forehead slick with fine beads of sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Looking disheveled, he wiped the sweat from his brow and instinctively clutched the jade pendant around his neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This magic treasure, a legacy of the Ban Clan, was one of their foundational assets. It had repeatedly saved Ban Ji from the brink of demonic possession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Gradually calming down, Ban Ji paced within his cave dwelling, pondering how to deal with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"This is my Human Tribulation... but I can't directly eliminate Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ban Ji had previously sent Ning Zhuo a challenge letter, which Ning Zhuo politely declined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ban Ji intended to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect. While the sect had few formal rules, any violation could easily lead to severe consequences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">One such rule explicitly stated that conflicts between individuals like Ban Ji and Ning Zhuo must be resolved through the Martial Performance Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">If Ban Ji were to attack Ning Zhuo directly and be exposed, the Myriad Manifestations Sect would inevitably punish him severely, potentially even making him a cautionary example.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"No one has resorted to such methods in over a century of Flying Cloud Assemblies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Even if I provoke Ning Zhuo relentlessly, he'll likely refuse to enter the Martial Performance Hall with me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ban Ji had already observed Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Through the naturally emanating spiritual energy, he discerned that Ning Zhuo was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment Stage, while Ban Ji himself had reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Although Ning Zhuo possesses a Golden Core-level mechanical puppet, his control over it is lacking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"My control skills far surpass his, and my divine sense is leagues ahead!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"His Golden Core-level mechanical puppet is likely just a safeguard provided by his family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"But the Golden Core-level mechanical construct in my hands is my true combat power - the result of years of painstaking effort, step-by-step refinement, and relentless improvement!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"And I have more than just one!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ban Ji's face flashed with pride.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"My strength far exceeds Ning Zhuo's, but that brat will never face me head-on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"He's using the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Sect Rules to harass me and sabotage my plans. Yet I can't directly retaliate. Disgusting! Utterly disgusting!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"That hypocritical little scoundrel!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ban Ji's fury burned unabated. As he thought of this, the image of the big-headed youth smiling faintly at him surfaced in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ban Ji's eyes narrowed, his hatred so intense he wished he could tear Ning Zhuo's mouth apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"I can't rely on Qing Huangzi anymore."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"But I still have other options!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"I can't afford to fail again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"I was truly careless this time, prematurely revealing information and allowing Ning Zhuo to interfere in Qing Huangzi's Minor Trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ban Ji resolved to keep his movements strictly secret from now on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"I must prevent Ning Zhuo from harassing me again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"My cultivation of Demonic Arts goes against the natural order. Ning Zhuo is my Human Tribulation, so whenever I'm near him, my Qi Luck will inevitably be lower, making me prone to misfortune."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"I can't afford to fail in the upcoming Rising Cloud Minor Trials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"These trials aren't just tests; they're also crucial networking opportunities. When I join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, these connections will allow me to quickly establish myself and advance smoothly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Rising Cloud Minor Trials and the Flying Cloud Assembly hold immense significance for cultivators, shaping their future prospects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After pacing thoughtfully for a while, Ban Ji sent out four Flying Messages in quick succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"First, I'll give Ning Zhuo something to keep him busy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Once I've passed these Rising Cloud Minor Trials, I'll turn my attention back to him and settle the score properly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Moments later, in his newly cleaned and repaired cave abode, Ban Ji welcomed four Demonic Cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">There was the Rust Disaster Artisan, the Mad Monk, Lady Coiled Silk, and finally, the Miasma Mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ban Ji cut straight to the point: "I've hired you all at great expense to deal with a single target."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"This man is called Ning Zhuo. He ruined a crucial opportunity for me, and I harbor a deep-seated hatred for him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Do everything you can to harass him and distract him. If you succeed, I'll reward you handsomely!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">With that, Ban Ji handed over four copied Jade Slips to the Demonic Cultivators. "These contain Ning Zhuo's information."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The four cultivators immediately probed the Jade Slips with their divine sense, rapidly scanning the contents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Mist Mother Liu Qingyan frowned slightly. "This information is... sparse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ban Ji replied, "I purchased the highest-level intelligence from the Trading Hall. Ning Zhuo... he's likely not from this country."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Lady Coiled Silk chuckled playfully. "Though the information is limited, the fact that he associates with Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong suggests he's no ordinary cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">She cast a sultry glance at Ban Ji. "Young Master Ban, it's rare to see you harbor such animosity toward a peer. What exactly did he do to you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ban Ji snorted coldly, forcing the words through clenched teeth: "If we weren't within the Myriad Manifestations Sect - if we were outside - I would have crushed him into dust long ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Rust Disaster Artisan's voice was hoarse as he pressed Ban Ji for the truth. "The intelligence didn't say how you were defeated. If you want us to deal with him, you need to tell us more. What's with all the secrecy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"If you waste our time, I'll start to suspect that Ning Zhuo is just a smokescreen - a ploy by you, Ban Ji, to stall us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ban Ji narrowed his eyes, glaring at the Rust Disaster Artisan, his killing intent palpable. "Blacksmith, don't push your luck. You think I'd scheme against you? Do you even have family backing? My future prospects far surpass yours. Why would I waste my energy plotting against you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Provoked, the Rust Disaster Artisan took a step forward, closing in on Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Seeing the two were about to clash, the Mad Monk quickly stepped between them. "Enough! We haven't even dealt with Ning Zhuo yet, and we're already turning on each other? This won't do."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He addressed the Rust Disaster Artisan first. "The four of us have cooperated well with Ban Ji before, and we have an agreement to assist each other. This time, he's using that agreement to ask us to act. Let's honor our word."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Rust Disaster Artisan snorted coldly but reluctantly retreated to his original position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The Mad Monk turned to Ban Ji and said, "Young Master Ban, the Rust Disaster Artisan isn't wrong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"We're all here for the Flying Cloud Assembly, hoping to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"You're wasting our time and energy by making us harass this Ning Zhuo. We wanted to try the Soaring Cloud Trials multiple times - "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ban Ji cut him off with a wave. "Since your time and energy are so precious, why aren't you getting to work?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Spare me the nonsense about raising the price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"It's unnecessary!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"After you succeed, I'll reward the one who completes the task with triple the agreed price."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"That's all there is to it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"My offer is already exceptionally generous. Don't get greedy, you four. Take it or leave it - one word!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ban Ji glared at the four cultivators, his dominance palpable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The atmosphere in the cave grew tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Lady Coiled Silk suddenly laughed, breaking the tension. "I accept! At such a high price, how could I refuse?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"What about the three of you?" Ban Ji asked, his hands clasped behind his back, a hint of arrogance in his smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The Mad Monk and the other two exchanged glances and nodded in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ban Ji paid the deposit, clasped his hands in a farewell gesture, and said, "Then I'll await your good news."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Watching the four figures depart, Ban Ji mused to himself, "Any one of these four is my equal in combat strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"I refuse to believe they can't subdue you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The challenge letter and the rumors targeting Ning Zhuo surfaced almost simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Mad Monk?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Who's that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo read the Flying Message, puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Soon after, Old Chef came to report on the rumors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo suddenly understood. "The rumors concern the Mad Monk's challenge, and he's fabricated a pretext - claiming my family once nearly tortured him to death. He says he's here for revenge, to uphold the Righteous Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"This tactic... it's so cliché."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Zhuo immediately thought of Ban Ji and Pi Fujie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"The Mad Monk came prepared, his malice obvious. These two are likely involved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"But slandering my family... does he even know where my family is? Who's in it? Does he know anything at all?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but let out a few cold chuckles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">If he were in Shen Xi's situation, this would be a real problem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The Shen Family of Nine Palaces Immortal City held considerable prestige in the Flying Cloud Kingdom. As the family's foremost representative at the Foundation Establishment stage - a universally acknowledged genius cultivator - Shen Xi would undoubtedly be the first to step forward and defend the family's honor against such slander.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Lin Jinglong and Situ Xing would do the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Families, sects, and other factions deliberately cultivate figureheads. A Foundation Establishment stage figurehead represents the faction's future prospects, while a Golden Core stage figurehead represents its diplomatic prowess. After all, Nascent Soul-level cultivators cannot move freely and often require prior authorization.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">In most cases, minor conflicts between factions are resolved through contests between Golden Core-level cultivators, establishing dominance and determining outcomes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">A Nascent Soul-level cultivator could single-handedly destroy an ordinary town. Using such power would escalate a minor conflict into a full-blown war.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Ning Zhuo was not Shen Xi, and the Ning Clan was not the Shen Family of Nine Palaces Immortal City. In the Flying Cloud Kingdom, Ning Zhuo and the Ning Clan's reputation was virtually nonexistent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Therefore, when the rumors spread, people's first reaction wasn't to look down on the Ning Clan, but rather confusion: "Who is Ning Zhuo?" and "Which Ning Clan is that?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
