<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Wooden Wheel Town.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Battalion had set up camp.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the main commander's tent, Mulan slowly regained consciousness. When she opened her eyes, she saw Ning Zhuo and Zhang Zhongyi standing by the bedside.<br/>
<br/>
As she tried to sit up, Ning Zhuo gently pressed her shoulder down.<br/>
<br/>
"Mulan General, though you've woken up, you should focus on recovering first. The Red Flower Battalion has successfully returned. Your deputy has already reported to Commander Du, and the camp has been set up just outside Wooden Wheel Town. Everything is in order.”<br/>
<br/>
Hearing this, Mulan's expression softened.<br/>
<br/>
Standing to the side, Zhang Zhongyi added, “Mulan General, you pushed your body beyond its limits when you forced out the second arrow.”<br/>
<br/>
“Fortunately, Young Master Ning Zhuo came to assist us, and he provided a substantial amount of precious materials at the Golden Core and Nascent Soul levels to be used as medicinal ingredients.”<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, you wouldn't have recovered so quickly."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan turned to look at Ning Zhuo. “Young... Master Ning, thank you.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled. "There's no need to thank me, General Mulan. After all, my mechanized army operates under your command.<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest, the reason I crushed the talisman you gave me was to find out if there was any merit to be earned on your side.<br/>
<br/>
"Those two arrows you shot were truly awe-inspiring. You killed one Nascent Soul-level opponent and forced the other to flee. I was utterly amazed!"<br/>
<br/>
The combat strength of the Ancient God of the Azure Moon was at the Nascent Soul level.<br/>
<br/>
If it had been at the Soul Formation level, it would have long since been able to rival the Dragon King of the Ginseng Beard River, and the Azure Moon Tribe's status would have been far higher than it was now.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan replied, “If the opponent were someone like Lord Long, I would have only been able to fire one arrow with all my strength.<br/>
<br/>
"But against the Ancient God of the Azure Moon and Di Lu, I deliberately held back on the first arrow, which allowed me to fire a second one."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo praised her, “Such divine-level techniques are remarkable. Even a battlefield cannot suppress the power of your divine arrows. Nascent Soul cultivators flee with incredible speed, yet Di Lu had no chance at escape.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan, with a hint of pride, added, “This technique was cultivated from an early age. My father, recognizing my talent, spared no expense or connections in hiring several renowned masters to teach me martial arts and military strategy.<br/>
<br/>
"Now, at last, it has borne some fruit."<br/>
<br/>
In truth, after this battle, Mulan felt a slight sense of relief.<br/>
<br/>
In the previous ambush, when she led the Three Generals Battalion into battle, they achieved little, which brought tremendous pressure upon the Mulan General's Residence. After returning to the Forest Immortal City, she was immediately subjected to scheming and obstruction from various factions within the nation.<br/>
<br/>
This time, however, although the battle was perilous, the results were impressive. Killing one Nascent Soul-level enemy and forcing another to flee was a sufficient accomplishment to restore the reputation of the General's Residence. Leading the Red Flower Battalion to such success would make Mulan's efforts more recognized and alleviate much of the political pressure from the imperial court.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi commented, “Speaking of which, last time in Forest Immortal City, it was thanks to Young Master Ning Zhuo that we were able to resolve our predicament and continue leading troops to build our reputation.<br/>
<br/>
"This time, venturing into Thousand Peaks Forest was another perilous endeavor. Without Young Master Ning Zhuo's timely rescue, the Red Flower Battle Formation would have failed, and we would have suffered heavy casualties—perhaps even defeat."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi sighed deeply.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly waved his hand. "Not at all. Even without me, with General Mulan's capabilities, there was still a chance of victory."<br/>
<br/>
Mulan shook her head slightly. "The odds were slim. This victory and its results owe much to your contributions, Young Master Ning Zhuo. Rest assured, I will ensure your achievements are recognized and nothing will go unacknowledged."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately smiled. "General, please focus on your recovery. My mechanized army has suffered heavy losses and needs to be rebuilt and replenished. If you'll excuse me, I must take my leave."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi frowned and glared at Ning Zhuo's retreating back.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan nodded. "Replenishing our forces is critical. Young Master Ning Zhuo indeed needs to seize every moment. I won't see you off."<br/>
<br/>
This time, Zhang Zhongyi turned his glare toward Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
Neither Mulan nor Ning Zhuo could understand Zhang Zhongyi's reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi sighed deeply, shaking his head repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo left the Red Flower Battalion and returned to the Three Generals Battalion to meet with Liu, Guan, and Zhang.<br/>
<br/>
The four of them shared their experiences and discussed recent events.<br/>
<br/>
After their victory, the Three Generals Battalion had marched under Shen Qinghe's escort, immediately retreating from the Dice Bone Giantwood Mountain and heading back.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's combat experience and achievements left the three generals envious.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei rarely lamented, “If I had known this would happen, I should've gone with the strategist. What a shame, such a pity. All I did was capture a Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator alive with my two sworn brothers —I’ve never actually killed one myself."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo spread his hands and smiled bitterly. “General Zhang, I was merely taking a beating. The real work was done by General Mulan.”<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong stroked his beard and sighed. “The Scarlet-Heart Roc Arrow is truly marvelous!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er looked at Ning Zhuo. "Listening to everything, it's clear: without the strategist's timely intervention, the Red Flower Battalion would've been in dire straits. Strategist, you risked great danger, and your contribution to this victory is undeniable. When the rewards are distributed, if you don't receive the lion's share, I won't accept it."<br/>
<br/>
His words were sincere and heartfelt.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er's former animosity toward Ning Zhuo seemed to have lessened.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei, puzzled, asked, "Didn't Lord Shen Qinghe say that each battalion had a Nascent Soul-level protector in the shadows? Why didn't the Red Flower Battalion receive any such reinforcements?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head with a bitter smile.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and Guan Hong exchanged glances and fell into silence.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei asked again, "By the way, why hasn't the Golden Halberd Army returned yet?"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er speculated, “The Golden Halberd Army is formidable. Perhaps they ventured too deep, so their retreat route is much longer than ours.”<br/>
<br/>
As they were discussing this, a soldier arrived with an urgent report, delivering shocking news.<br/>
<br/>
"What? The Golden Halberd Army was completely annihilated!"<br/>
<br/>
The four of them looked at each other in disbelief, their expressions filled with shock.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong was the first to react. He furrowed his brows and spoke gravely, “In terms of overall strength, the Three Generals Battalion is no match for the Golden Halberd Army.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei nodded. "Even if the three of us joined forces and performed exceptionally, we could only stall Sun Gan. The Golden Halberd Army would still be able to crush the Three Generals Battalion."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er sighed. "Four battalions were dispatched, yet the strongest, the Golden Halberd Army, was the one to fall."<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Halberd Army was one of the elite forces of Two Note Nation.<br/>
<br/>
Their equipment was the finest, and their training unmatched.<br/>
<br/>
While the Three Generals Battalion only mastered three battle formations, the Golden Halberd Army had mastered at least ten.<br/>
<br/>
Their commander, Sun Gan, was a Nascent Soul-level powerhouse.<br/>
<br/>
By all accounts, they were a first-class military force—a trump card of Two Note Nation.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, against all logic, they were sent to attack Thousand Peaks Forest and ended up as the only battalion to suffer total annihilation.<br/>
<br/>
Even the Nascent Soul-level powerhouse secretly dispatched by Commander Du Tiechuan had perished.<br/>
<br/>
The four of them studied the military report together.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei said, “The Golden Halberd Army only faced two Nascent Soul-level opponents: Gu Ya and the current Elephant King.<br/>
<br/>
"We know Gu Ya's strength. This suggests the current Elephant King was the key to their defeat."<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong added, "That demon cultivator, born of the Pale Barbarian Elephant lineage, is usually neither violent nor impulsive and rarely takes action. But when he does, it’s earth-shattering—he wiped out an elite army of Two Note Nation!"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er remarked, “Judging by the results, this probing attack by Commander Du resulted in us killing one Nascent Soul-level enemy and severely injuring several others. However, we lost Sun Gan and the Golden Halberd Army. Overall, it was a minor defeat."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained silent, reflecting on the intelligence regarding the current Elephant King.<br/>
<br/>
In his heart, he thought, "If I had a body like his, I could withstand more uses of the Heroic Return Technique and wouldn't have been in such a precarious situation against Di Lu."<br/>
<br/>
The Heroic Return Technique had immense potential.<br/>
<br/>
This battlefield technique, derived from the High Victory Codex, had been comprehended by Ning Zhuo with the aid of the Unified Helm of Warriors.<br/>
<br/>
Both the High Victory Codex and the Unified Helm of Warriors were priceless treasures in military strategy.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo's physical limitations restricted the technique's full potential.<br/>
<br/>
Reflecting on the previous battle, Ning Zhuo regretted not daring to include Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu in the Heroic Return Technique, fearing that his body would be overwhelmed and explode.<br/>
<br/>
"Is there any way to rapidly enhance my physical foundation?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was troubled.<br/>
<br/>
Upon returning to Forest Immortal City, he had purchased various war supplies, including talismans and elixirs to enhance his physical foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, compared to what the Heroic Return Technique demanded, these were mere drops in the bucket.<br/>
<br/>
"If Commander Du bestows rewards for our accomplishments, perhaps I can request some high-grade elixirs or talismans?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was currently in the Treasure Nourishment Stage of the Foundation Establishment phase.<br/>
<br/>
At this stage, the integration of essence, energy, and spirit was emphasized, unlike the preceding Field Opening Stage, which requires mere accumulation.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the nation's standard resources were no longer as effective.<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, national resources are still valuable. It's just that..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was more focused on enhancing his physical foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, he wanted to quickly meet the standard required to leverage the Heroic Return Technique, amplifying his combat power to the Nascent Soul level.<br/>
<br/>
"War is fraught with peril.<br/>
<br/>
"Even the Golden Halberd Army was completely wiped out.<br/>
<br/>
"From these battles, it's clear: only Nascent Soul-level strength provides relative security in such high-level battlefields.<br/>
<br/>
"And luck still plays a role.<br/>
<br/>
"My fortune, however..."<br/>
<br/>
During the battle with the Dice Bone Demon God, he had consistently rolled sixes.<br/>
<br/>
But in the recent Moonhook Mountain battle, he only rolled a five.<br/>
<br/>
"My luck isn't as strong as it once was.<br/>
<br/>
"In fact, during the Greatwood Mountain battle, Commander Sun and I almost perished.<br/>
<br/>
“Though I gained immense benefits in the end, it also proved that my fortune is indeed in decline.<br/>
<br/>
“Why is this happening?”<br/>
<br/>
The mysterious fluctuations in his luck and fortune puzzled Ning Zhuo. He was entirely in the dark about their cause.<br/>
<br/>
After bidding farewell to the Three Generals, Ning Zhuo returned to his camp and immediately began working within the Mechanized Dragon, crafting mechanized puppets.<br/>
<br/>
His mechanized army had been reduced to less than 20% of its original strength. The losses were severe, and reinforcements were urgently needed.<br/>
<br/>
Given Ning Zhuo's situation, the mechanized army was far more critical than Meng Yehu and Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Missing one or two Golden Core-level mechanized units wasn't catastrophic.<br/>
<br/>
But without his mechanized army, Ning Zhuo couldn't bolster his own combat power. On the battlefield, relying solely on a few Golden Core-level protectors was far less reliable than having his own forces.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, Ning Zhuo prioritized crafting mechanized puppets over repairing Meng Yehu and Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
The three mechanized crafting platforms —Xuanyuan Nine-Craft Platforms —operated ceaselessly, producing puppets at a rate dozens of times faster than Ning Zhuo could manage alone.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, was not idle. He needed to oversee and guide the production.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong watched and learned from the sidelines.<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo, teach me.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll try to learn as quickly as possible so I can help you craft these puppets.<br/>
<br/>
"That way, you'll have more time to cultivate using the Fetal Spirit Boat."<br/>
<br/>
Although Sun Lingtong had decent skill in mechanized crafting, it was still far behind Ning Zhuo's expertise.<br/>
<br/>
As he earnestly sought guidance, Ning Zhuo taught him without reservation, sharing all his knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, being talented and diligent, made rapid progress under Ning Zhuo's careful instruction.<br/>
<br/>
While the two worked and learned together, a messenger arrived with urgent news.<br/>
<br/>
"The Commander has summoned me?" Ning Zhuo stepped out of the Mechanized Dragon, slightly surprised.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er expressed concern. “Could it be that we executed that Iron Eagle overseer, and Commander Du Tiechuan wants to hold us accountable?”<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong, ever loyal, declared, "If that's the case, then the three of us will share the responsibility. If there's punishment to be dealt, we'll face it together."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei shouted, "Punishment for what? That Iron Eagle acted without proper orders. Besides, we didn't even lay a hand on him!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo touched the mechanized ring on his finger, his expression calm. “I suspect that if the Commander wanted to hold us accountable, he would summon all four of us. Since I've been summoned alone, it must be for another matter.<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t worry.<br/>
<br/>
"I'll find out once I meet him."<br/>
<br/>
With that, Ning Zhuo followed the messenger away from the Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
The three generals escorted him out.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei muttered, “Say what you will, but the strategist is young and yet remarkably composed.”<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong stroked his beard. “Indeed, he’s an outstanding man.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, who had previously disliked Ning Zhuo, now silently watched his departing figure, saying nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo entered Wooden Wheel Town and was escorted to meet a Soul Formation-level figure.<br/>
<br/>
"The Military Strategist of the Three Generals Battalion, Ning Zhuo, pays his respects to Commander Du." Ning Zhuo saluted.<br/>
<br/>
Commander Du Tiechuan kept his eyes on the documents in front of him, not even looking up.<br/>
<br/>
"You've subdued the Dice Bone Demon God. That's commendable.<br/>
<br/>
"There's some military intelligence we need to extract from it.<br/>
<br/>
"Sit. Someone will come shortly to calculate your fortune."<br/>
<br/>
Before long, a young cultivator entered, his aura at the Nascent Soul level.<br/>
<br/>
"Song Ji greets Commander Du."<br/>
<br/>
Song Ji's face was tranquil as autumn water, and his green robe gave him an elegant, jade-like demeanor.<br/>
<br/>
Commander Du finally looked up, nodding slightly at the young cultivator. “Song Ji, as a trusted advisor, please calculate Ning Zhuo’s fortune.”<br/>
<br/>
Song Ji complied and approached Ning Zhuo, performing a divination.<br/>
<br/>
"Your fortune is strong, but it is like water without roots —already more than half spent, with little remaining.<br/>
<br/>
"Subduing the Dice Bone Demon God may have been your greatest use of fortune."</div>
