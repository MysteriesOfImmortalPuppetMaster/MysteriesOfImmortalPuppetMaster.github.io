<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The flames burned silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The tongues of fire danced in silence, their graceful movements exuding compassionate Buddhist sentiment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Cremation Fire Cremation Prajna Spirit-Resolving Sutra!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo stood before the fireball, his eyes reflecting the firelight, showing a look of reluctance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">In the flames, the original materials and components of the Cang Iron Armor melted quickly, and occasionally, spiritual essence emerged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The spiritual essence, scattered in tiny specks, floated in the air, and then, following the guidance of Ning Zhuo’s spiritual sense, most of it fell onto a mechanical doll.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This mechanical doll resembled an ascetic Bhikkhuni, its linen-colored robe wrapped around the joint mechanisms, its sleeve cuffs exposing bronze palms, and a dot of vermilion mark between its brows circulating with Buddhist light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Its face appeared to smile but not quite, its eyelids half-lowered, subtly harboring compassion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At the knees, a bronze pivot was visible; the feet were a pair of hemp-woven straw shoes, subtly containing array formations that were indistinct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">It was the Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">A large part of the spiritual essence was infused into the Buddhist Healer, while the remaining portion was still absorbed by Ning Zhuo into his Spirit Containment Box.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo improved and enhanced the Cang Iron Armor; the replaced materials were directly cremated, nourishing Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin’s spiritual essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“This way, the backup item I have held has been expended.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">A faint sense of crisis arose in Ning Zhuo’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Cang Iron Armor had always been his safeguard, to prevent any mishap with Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin. In case her spiritual essence dropped to a dangerously low level, the Cang Iron Armor would have been a lifesaver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Burning the Cang Iron Armor in advance did not provide a means to completely cure Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Leaving this trump card as a lifesaving measure was the best strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“I hope to obtain that mechanical carriage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Other than that, the more the better!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">If it were only a mechanical carriage, Ning Zhuo would not immediately resort to cremation, but would use it to replace the Cang Iron Armor, serving as the final insurance measure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The flames continued to burn, with no further spiritual essence emerging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After Ning Zhuo removed the residue and waste materials, he then fed in a pile of relics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">These relics were obtained from Tian Shuang, and originated from Qi Bai. Tian Shuang had used these relics to calculate and deduce Ning Zhuo’s location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Tian Shuang’s great gift, through a twist of fate, had enabled Ning Zhuo to obtain Qi Bai’s relics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">There was nothing more to say about that - straight to cremation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The flames burned, the spiritual essence danced, gathering into the body of the Netherworld Envoy, Qi Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The mechanical Qi Bai had a main body that was black, with a gray-white color scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">It stood six feet five, with a slim figure. It wore a conical jet-black hat, its head gray-white and strikingly resembling human bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">At its eye area was a black strip, through which a gray-white horizontal line shone, radiating a soul light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Because previously, Ning Zhuo had employed the Netherworld Envoy, Qi Bai, in battle in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, causing it to lack spiritual essence. Since then, Ning Zhuo had rarely used it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In the battle of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, Ning Zhuo also did not bring it out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">On one hand, even if he took it out, it would not solve the problem; on the other, it might expose him, inciting the wrath of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth and further worsening the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Qi Bai’s spiritual essence kept increasing, but the look of anticipation in Ning Zhuo’s eyes gradually dimmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">It was because Qi Bai’s spiritual essence increased more and more slowly, ultimately halting at ninety-two percent, remaining fixed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Alas, without reaching a full hundred percent of spiritual essence, there can be no qualitative transformation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“This golden core-level puppet still could not be used with ease.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo thought of Di Hui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">According to what Tian Shuang had said, Di Hui also had some of Qi Bai’s relics in his possession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“As long as it is burned, Qi Bai’s spiritual essence is highly likely to reach one hundred percent! With the qualitative transformation, its spiritual essence would then be able to recover on its own.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Before that, it is better to use it less.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Although the Netherworld Envoy, Qi Bai, was of the golden core level, its spiritual essence had not undergone qualitative transformation; thus, it was a consumable with limited uses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Moreover, as it involved the Soul Path and clearly exhibited demonic traits with a strong aura of the evil sect, it was not suitable for Ning Zhuo to use in public.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Once it is exposed, if the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth detect its spiritual essence, they might realize the importance of Qi Bai’s relics.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“For the sake of future success, it is better to endure for now, keeping this card in hand without hurrying to play it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Both the Netherworld Envoy, Qi Bai, and the Buddhist Healer, Meng Yaoyin, were produced from the Lava Immortal Palace, carrying with them the understanding of mechanical arts by the Three Sect's Masters. They shared a common characteristic: integration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Because the division between the components was not clear, these two dolls appeared as if they were formed as one, causing great difficulty for Ning Zhuo in deciphering their structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Although Ning Zhuo had the intention to study them in depth, he had always lacked time and energy - it could be said he was willing but unable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">After putting away these two mechanical dolls, Ning Zhuo took out the Cang Iron Armor again, to test and practice with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">At the moment, he did not yet have a Golden Core; therefore, he could only use spirit stones, ground into a spherical shape and embedded into the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel, to barely serve as a substitute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He donned the brand new Cang Iron Armor, shaking his twin wings on his back as he flew through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">While gliding, his twin wings were fixed, his shoulder plates hung down and buckled on the sides of his helmet, and with his pointed head, the parts of his shoulders and head formed a triangular shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">His arms were pressed tightly against his sides, and his legs were together without a trace of gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">At the rear legs and heels, there was a pair of fish-fin-like partitions that could adjust direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">While gliding, the consumption of spiritual power was noticeably lower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">When truly bursting into speed, the golden swallow’s twin wings would completely fold up, clinging to his back; various parts of the Cang Iron Armor would reveal jet nozzles, spouting out Li Fire to provide a powerful propulsion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Once Ning Zhuo accelerated in this manner, he was like an arrow leaving the bow, slicing through the vast sky, breaking the air, and leaving behind a long, straight tail of Li Fire flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Exhilarating!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The only drawback was that in this situation, the spirit stone ball could not support it at all and was quickly exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Golden Core - only a Golden Core can support the current Cang Iron Armor!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo had already contacted the Three General Camp and had sent a letter to Zhao Xi. He waited for a response, for the Golden Core, and possibly for a Nascent Soul, while at the same time using his fetal breath spirit boat to cultivate his physical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The stronger his physical body, the greater the military tactics enhancement he could receive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The benefits were obvious, and Ning Zhuo was utterly addicted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In addition, he also improved and designed Five Elements spells, and practiced them repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Li Fire Burn Filth Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This spell ignited wounds, capable of burning away filth entirely, and was very effective against the methods of the Soul Path and poison cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Blazing Healing Divine Flame!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Once this spell was cast, it could ignite a patch of flame in the spirit sea; the flames would scorch away various harmful thoughts, preserving the useful ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This was the countermeasure that Ning Zhuo, having suffered from the harm of Buddhist thoughts, conceived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Rock Soul - Calming Incantation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After casting it, a cultivator could transform part of their flesh and blood into rock, to resist pain and also to suppress the soul, warding off harm to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">This method was added by Ning Zhuo after he had suffered from Tian Shuang’s Frost Soul Gaze divine skill; having bitterly learned from his pain, he supplemented the shortcomings in his soul defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He designed this spell by focusing on its might, which also resulted in significant drawbacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After casting it, his own speed would plummet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Pure Land Supplementation Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">This spell required the treasure material of the Western Pure Land.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo still had some reserves in hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">By using this spell, Ning Zhuo could achieve the regeneration of severed limbs, along with a mysterious purifying might. The newly reborn limbs were completely pure, without any filth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">In addition, Ning Zhuo also optimized the Flame Cloak Technique and designed a three-layer Li Fire Shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He also designed the Thick Earth Armor and the Rock Slab Shield of the Earth Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Having suffered many losses in previous life-or-death battles, this time he made up for the deficiencies in defense and healing within the Five Elements spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Five Elements realm was so profound that one could do whatever one wished!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">From these spells it was apparent that, in order to save energy and time, Ning Zhuo had only designed using the Earth Path and the Fire Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The reason for this choice was that he currently only possessed the Earth Path Spleen Temple and the Fire Path Heart Temple. As long as he directed his spiritual sense to the temple, he could precisely control Earth Path and Fire Path spells - a benefit he had unexpectedly gained during his previous life-or-death battles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Therefore, supplementing the remaining three paths also became Ning Zhuo’s cultivation goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">When saying goodbye to Lin Bufan, Ning Zhuo had already reached an agreement with him, modifying the previous cooperation terms so that Lin Bufan would fetch his Ten-Thousand Year Water Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">In addition to practicing these spells, Ning Zhuo also raced against time, squeezing out some spare moments to design mechanical constructs capable of flight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Because time was extremely tight, Ning Zhuo, based on the actual situation, could only choose to operate with the most practical solution first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">According to the biological structure of the Golden Swallow, he bionically created a mechanical Golden Swallow. This undoubtedly saved him from spending a large amount of energy and time on this design stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Subsequently, on that basis, he further improved the mechanical Golden Swallow, making its control method closer to that of the Thunderstrike Bird.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The mechanical Thunderstrike Bird was considered a typical mechanism, which Ning Zhuo often used in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City. To be precise, when he was under the identity of the Young Puppet Master, the Thunderstrike Bird was one of his conventional offensive methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Therefore, Ning Zhuo was very skilled in operating it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">With the improved mechanical Golden Swallow, the practice process was naturally reduced, allowing Ning Zhuo to easily master it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“With a mechanical pedestal, I can mass-produce mechanical Golden Swallows.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“But for them to truly exert their effect, they must be formed into a battle formation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“If only my military strategy realm could be as profound as the Five Elements realm, that would be ideal.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo held “Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings” and the “Unified Helmets of the Warriors,” but he had not yet fully grasped the martial art of the Hero’s Return Technique; therefore, he could not proceed to the next level of military strategy enlightenment through the dual-treasure combination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">However, after these several major battles, his understanding of this martial strategy had deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This was the normal pace of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo’s Five Elements realm was completely an exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo was racing against time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The battle with the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth accelerated his growth and also pushed the overall situation forward by a great deal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Just as I expected, a great war was about to commence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“I hope that this time, I will have the chance to strike against the Six Cave Sect!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo harbored many worries in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Given the current situation, this was very likely his last chance on the Thousand Peaks Forest battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The longer time dragged on, the more likely it was that the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth would return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">It would be best if, when the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth returned, he could achieve his own objective and then quickly withdraw!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">After all, any methods of detection or tracking had distance limitations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">According to the information left by Tian Shuang, the reason the Soul Devouring Sect knew of Ning Zhuo’s location was that after Ning Zhuo voluntarily revealed his identity in Two Note Nation, through several transfers, they came to know of it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Only when Tian Shuang and Di Hui, carrying Qi Bai’s relics, arrived within the range of Thousand Peaks Forest did they begin tracking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Thousand Peaks Forest - a certain mountain peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Boom, boom, boom……</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Tian Shuang flew high in the sky, continuously bombarding Di Hui, causing shards of ice to fly about with thunderous sounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Di Hui, with his heart in extreme agony, cried, “What kind of thing is this!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">He did not dare to go deep underground for fear that Tian Shuang might lose track of him and return to Ning Zhuo’s side, or take other actions such as, feeling his sins were too heavy and committing suicide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Therefore, Di Hui had to keep Tian Shuang restrained, dragging him to a remote area to prevent other cultivators from seeing and scheming improper thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Di Hui had to admit that they had been defeated this time. This was the most abject encounter that the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, this pair of partners, had experienced in nearly ten years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">“Tian Shuang, you fellow, you’ve even used this move!” Di Hui cried out in pain, his body covered in frost and in utter disarray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Tian Shuang’s face showed deep sorrow: “My partner, do not be so stubborn; quickly allow me to finish you off - this is my redemption, and also yours.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">“Our sins are too heavy; only by repenting with death can we properly atone to all living beings.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">Di Hui, so angry that his eyelids twitched, gritted his teeth and shouted, “Tian Shuang, listen to what you’re saying! I have recorded it all on the Jade Slips - when you return to normal, let’s see how you face me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Tian Shuang turned a deaf ear, simply continuing to bombard relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">While Di Hui fled in disarray, he kept shouting, “Record it, I have recorded it all for you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Thousand Peaks Forest Frontline Main Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">“Have these two cultivators - the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth - still not been found?” Lord Long frowned and admonished the other cultivators, “With so many of you, what exactly are you doing?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">The other cultivators all wore bitter expressions; one of them shook his head and said, “Lord Long, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth are no ordinary beings - they are experts of the Nascent Soul level. Coming from the Soul Devouring Sect, such a major demonic sect, even if they receive our flying messages, they simply will not pay us any heed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">Lord Long fell into silent contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">Lu Hongtu, on the side, exclaimed, “The combined attack of Heaven and Earth is indeed formidable; in one strike, it caused Two Note Nation to lose six or seven Nascent Soul cultivators.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">“Now is exactly when the armies of Two Note Nation are weak; it is most likely the opportune moment for us to deploy our forces in this war.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">“If we can locate the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth and invest heavily to have them participate in the great war, our side could increase our chances of victory by at least twenty percent!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">Then Lu Hongtu shifted his tone: “If we cannot find them, that would be most regrettable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">“Time waits for no one!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">“If we delay any further, such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will be lost. Two Note Nation, with their grand enterprises, must already be supplementing some Nascent Soul level cultivators at this time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">Lord Long cast a glance at Lu Hongtu, knowing that the latter’s exclamation was in fact advice to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">After some thought, Lord Long said, “Let’s not wait for the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth; summon everyone - we shall launch a strong attack on the frontline camp of Two Note Nation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">Two Note Nation Frontline Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">Zhao Xi frowned and questioned Liu Er, “Where is Ning Zhuo? Why hasn’t he returned yet?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">“With the great war imminent, if the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth come to attack……”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">Liu Er, with a face of helplessness, spread his hands and said, “My lord, you know me; I, a mere half-human, half-demon, how could I possibly command the dignified Ning family scion?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">“In fact, my Three General Camp had always been sponsored by him. He is the financial backer of my army - do I have the ability to really call him back?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">Zhao Xi snorted coldly, “Since he does not obey military orders, the battle merits and rewards he seeks will not be granted so swiftly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">Liu Er stole a glance at Zhao Xi and, seeing his ashen face, hesitated for a moment before saying, “My lord, Master Ning Zhuo is a person of another nation; his family is not even part of Two Note Nation. The only connection is his marital relationship with Mu Lan, but on that basis, he is still looked down upon - with an agreement that they will definitely separate in the future.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="286">“Tell me, do you think such a person would be constrained by others because of battle merits and rewards?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="288">Zhao Xi remained silent for a while, then pointed his finger at Liu Er and snorted coldly, “He indeed did not make a mistake in sponsoring you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="290">“Very well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="292">“Send these rewards to him as soon as possible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="294">“Hand them over to him in person!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="296">“And tell him that if, in this great war, he can assist our army and hold off the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, our nation will offer a heavy reward!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="298">“No, I will write a letter myself; you must deliver it to him in person.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="300">Liu Er immediately saluted, “I shall obey, my lord!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="302">After dismissing Liu Er, Zhao Xi was left alone in a room, letting out a deep sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="304">This high position was too scorching for his backside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="306">He could no longer sit still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="308">At that moment, he deeply regretted seizing power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="310">He truly had not expected the second great battle to come so quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="312">According to Zhao Xi’s plan, he had intended to rake in a huge amount of battle merits during this transitional period - he had not expected the transitional period to be so short!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
