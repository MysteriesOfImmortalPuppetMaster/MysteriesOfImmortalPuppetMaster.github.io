<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The flames burned silently.<br/>
<br/>
The tongues of fire danced in silence, their graceful movements exuding compassionate Buddhist sentiment.<br/>
<br/>
Cremation Fire Cremation Prajna Spirit-Resolving Sutra!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood before the fireball, his eyes reflecting the firelight, showing a look of reluctance.<br/>
<br/>
In the flames, the original materials and components of the Cang Iron Armor melted quickly, and occasionally, spiritual essence emerged.<br/>
<br/>
The spiritual essence, scattered in tiny specks, floated in the air, and then, following the guidance of Ning Zhuo’s spiritual sense, most of it fell onto a mechanical doll.<br/>
<br/>
This mechanical doll resembled an ascetic Bhikkhuni, its linen-colored robe wrapped around the joint mechanisms, its sleeve cuffs exposing bronze palms, and a dot of vermilion mark between its brows circulating with Buddhist light.<br/>
<br/>
Its face appeared to smile but not quite, its eyelids half-lowered, subtly harboring compassion.<br/>
<br/>
At the knees, a bronze pivot was visible; the feet were a pair of hemp-woven straw shoes, subtly containing array formations that were indistinct.<br/>
<br/>
It was the Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin.<br/>
<br/>
A large part of the spiritual essence was infused into the Buddhist Healer, while the remaining portion was still absorbed by Ning Zhuo into his Spirit Containment Box.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo improved and enhanced the Cang Iron Armor; the replaced materials were directly cremated, nourishing Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin’s spiritual essence.<br/>
<br/>
“This way, the backup item I have held has been expended.”<br/>
<br/>
A faint sense of crisis arose in Ning Zhuo’s heart.<br/>
<br/>
The Cang Iron Armor had always been his safeguard, to prevent any mishap with Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin. In case her spiritual essence dropped to a dangerously low level, the Cang Iron Armor would have been a lifesaver.<br/>
<br/>
Burning the Cang Iron Armor in advance did not provide a means to completely cure Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving this trump card as a lifesaving measure was the best strategy.<br/>
<br/>
“I hope to obtain that mechanical carriage.”<br/>
<br/>
“Other than that, the more the better!”<br/>
<br/>
If it were only a mechanical carriage, Ning Zhuo would not immediately resort to cremation, but would use it to replace the Cang Iron Armor, serving as the final insurance measure.<br/>
<br/>
The flames continued to burn, with no further spiritual essence emerging.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo removed the residue and waste materials, he then fed in a pile of relics.<br/>
<br/>
These relics were obtained from Tian Shuang, and originated from Qi Bai. Tian Shuang had used these relics to calculate and deduce Ning Zhuo’s location.<br/>
<br/>
Tian Shuang’s great gift, through a twist of fate, had enabled Ning Zhuo to obtain Qi Bai’s relics.<br/>
<br/>
There was nothing more to say about that - straight to cremation!<br/>
<br/>
The flames burned, the spiritual essence danced, gathering into the body of the Netherworld Envoy, Qi Bai.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical Qi Bai had a main body that was black, with a gray-white color scheme.<br/>
<br/>
It stood six feet five, with a slim figure. It wore a conical jet-black hat, its head gray-white and strikingly resembling human bones.<br/>
<br/>
At its eye area was a black strip, through which a gray-white horizontal line shone, radiating a soul light.<br/>
<br/>
Because previously, Ning Zhuo had employed the Netherworld Envoy, Qi Bai, in battle in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, causing it to lack spiritual essence. Since then, Ning Zhuo had rarely used it.<br/>
<br/>
In the battle of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, Ning Zhuo also did not bring it out.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, even if he took it out, it would not solve the problem; on the other, it might expose him, inciting the wrath of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth and further worsening the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Qi Bai’s spiritual essence kept increasing, but the look of anticipation in Ning Zhuo’s eyes gradually dimmed.<br/>
<br/>
It was because Qi Bai’s spiritual essence increased more and more slowly, ultimately halting at ninety-two percent, remaining fixed.<br/>
<br/>
“Alas, without reaching a full hundred percent of spiritual essence, there can be no qualitative transformation.”<br/>
<br/>
“This golden core-level puppet still could not be used with ease.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought of Di Hui.<br/>
<br/>
According to what Tian Shuang had said, Di Hui also had some of Qi Bai’s relics in his possession.<br/>
<br/>
“As long as it is burned, Qi Bai’s spiritual essence is highly likely to reach one hundred percent! With the qualitative transformation, its spiritual essence would then be able to recover on its own.”<br/>
<br/>
“Before that, it is better to use it less.”<br/>
<br/>
Although the Netherworld Envoy, Qi Bai, was of the golden core level, its spiritual essence had not undergone qualitative transformation; thus, it was a consumable with limited uses.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, as it involved the Soul Path and clearly exhibited demonic traits with a strong aura of the evil sect, it was not suitable for Ning Zhuo to use in public.<br/>
<br/>
“Once it is exposed, if the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth detect its spiritual essence, they might realize the importance of Qi Bai’s relics.”<br/>
<br/>
“For the sake of future success, it is better to endure for now, keeping this card in hand without hurrying to play it!”<br/>
<br/>
Both the Netherworld Envoy, Qi Bai, and the Buddhist Healer, Meng Yaoyin, were produced from the Lava Immortal Palace, carrying with them the understanding of mechanical arts by the Three Sect's Masters. They shared a common characteristic: integration.<br/>
<br/>
Because the division between the components was not clear, these two dolls appeared as if they were formed as one, causing great difficulty for Ning Zhuo in deciphering their structure.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo had the intention to study them in depth, he had always lacked time and energy - it could be said he was willing but unable.<br/>
<br/>
After putting away these two mechanical dolls, Ning Zhuo took out the Cang Iron Armor again, to test and practice with it.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, he did not yet have a Golden Core; therefore, he could only use spirit stones, ground into a spherical shape and embedded into the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel, to barely serve as a substitute.<br/>
<br/>
He donned the brand new Cang Iron Armor, shaking his twin wings on his back as he flew through the air.<br/>
<br/>
While gliding, his twin wings were fixed, his shoulder plates hung down and buckled on the sides of his helmet, and with his pointed head, the parts of his shoulders and head formed a triangular shape.<br/>
<br/>
His arms were pressed tightly against his sides, and his legs were together without a trace of gap.<br/>
<br/>
At the rear legs and heels, there was a pair of fish-fin-like partitions that could adjust direction.<br/>
<br/>
While gliding, the consumption of spiritual power was noticeably lower.<br/>
<br/>
When truly bursting into speed, the golden swallow’s twin wings would completely fold up, clinging to his back; various parts of the Cang Iron Armor would reveal jet nozzles, spouting out Li Fire to provide a powerful propulsion!<br/>
<br/>
Once Ning Zhuo accelerated in this manner, he was like an arrow leaving the bow, slicing through the vast sky, breaking the air, and leaving behind a long, straight tail of Li Fire flames.<br/>
<br/>
Exhilarating!<br/>
<br/>
The only drawback was that in this situation, the spirit stone ball could not support it at all and was quickly exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
“Golden Core - only a Golden Core can support the current Cang Iron Armor!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had already contacted the Three General Camp and had sent a letter to Zhao Xi. He waited for a response, for the Golden Core, and possibly for a Nascent Soul, while at the same time using his fetal breath spirit boat to cultivate his physical body.<br/>
<br/>
The stronger his physical body, the greater the military tactics enhancement he could receive.<br/>
<br/>
The benefits were obvious, and Ning Zhuo was utterly addicted!<br/>
<br/>
In addition, he also improved and designed Five Elements spells, and practiced them repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Li Fire Burn Filth Technique!<br/>
<br/>
This spell ignited wounds, capable of burning away filth entirely, and was very effective against the methods of the Soul Path and poison cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Blazing Healing Divine Flame!<br/>
<br/>
Once this spell was cast, it could ignite a patch of flame in the spirit sea; the flames would scorch away various harmful thoughts, preserving the useful ones.<br/>
<br/>
This was the countermeasure that Ning Zhuo, having suffered from the harm of Buddhist thoughts, conceived.<br/>
<br/>
Rock Soul - Calming Incantation!<br/>
<br/>
After casting it, a cultivator could transform part of their flesh and blood into rock, to resist pain and also to suppress the soul, warding off harm to it.<br/>
<br/>
This method was added by Ning Zhuo after he had suffered from Tian Shuang’s Frost Soul Gaze divine skill; having bitterly learned from his pain, he supplemented the shortcomings in his soul defense.<br/>
<br/>
He designed this spell by focusing on its might, which also resulted in significant drawbacks.<br/>
<br/>
After casting it, his own speed would plummet.<br/>
<br/>
Pure Land Supplementation Technique!<br/>
<br/>
This spell required the treasure material of the Western Pure Land.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo still had some reserves in hand.<br/>
<br/>
By using this spell, Ning Zhuo could achieve the regeneration of severed limbs, along with a mysterious purifying might. The newly reborn limbs were completely pure, without any filth.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Ning Zhuo also optimized the Flame Cloak Technique and designed a three-layer Li Fire Shield.<br/>
<br/>
He also designed the Thick Earth Armor and the Rock Slab Shield of the Earth Path.<br/>
<br/>
Having suffered many losses in previous life-or-death battles, this time he made up for the deficiencies in defense and healing within the Five Elements spells.<br/>
<br/>
The Five Elements realm was so profound that one could do whatever one wished!<br/>
<br/>
From these spells it was apparent that, in order to save energy and time, Ning Zhuo had only designed using the Earth Path and the Fire Path.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this choice was that he currently only possessed the Earth Path Spleen Temple and the Fire Path Heart Temple. As long as he directed his spiritual sense to the temple, he could precisely control Earth Path and Fire Path spells - a benefit he had unexpectedly gained during his previous life-or-death battles.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, supplementing the remaining three paths also became Ning Zhuo’s cultivation goal.<br/>
<br/>
When saying goodbye to Lin Bufan, Ning Zhuo had already reached an agreement with him, modifying the previous cooperation terms so that Lin Bufan would fetch his Ten-Thousand Year Water Essence.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to practicing these spells, Ning Zhuo also raced against time, squeezing out some spare moments to design mechanical constructs capable of flight.<br/>
<br/>
Because time was extremely tight, Ning Zhuo, based on the actual situation, could only choose to operate with the most practical solution first.<br/>
<br/>
According to the biological structure of the Golden Swallow, he bionically created a mechanical Golden Swallow. This undoubtedly saved him from spending a large amount of energy and time on this design stage.<br/>
<br/>
Subsequently, on that basis, he further improved the mechanical Golden Swallow, making its control method closer to that of the Thunderstrike Bird.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical Thunderstrike Bird was considered a typical mechanism, which Ning Zhuo often used in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City. To be precise, when he was under the identity of the Young Puppet Master, the Thunderstrike Bird was one of his conventional offensive methods.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Ning Zhuo was very skilled in operating it.<br/>
<br/>
With the improved mechanical Golden Swallow, the practice process was naturally reduced, allowing Ning Zhuo to easily master it.<br/>
<br/>
“With a mechanical pedestal, I can mass-produce mechanical Golden Swallows.”<br/>
<br/>
“But for them to truly exert their effect, they must be formed into a battle formation.”<br/>
<br/>
“If only my military strategy realm could be as profound as the Five Elements realm, that would be ideal.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo held “Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings” and the “Unified Helmets of the Warriors,” but he had not yet fully grasped the martial art of the Hero’s Return Technique; therefore, he could not proceed to the next level of military strategy enlightenment through the dual-treasure combination.<br/>
<br/>
However, after these several major battles, his understanding of this martial strategy had deepened.<br/>
<br/>
This was the normal pace of cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s Five Elements realm was completely an exception.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was racing against time.<br/>
<br/>
The battle with the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth accelerated his growth and also pushed the overall situation forward by a great deal.<br/>
<br/>
“Just as I expected, a great war was about to commence.”<br/>
<br/>
“I hope that this time, I will have the chance to strike against the Six Cave Sect!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo harbored many worries in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Given the current situation, this was very likely his last chance on the Thousand Peaks Forest battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The longer time dragged on, the more likely it was that the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth would return.<br/>
<br/>
It would be best if, when the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth returned, he could achieve his own objective and then quickly withdraw!<br/>
<br/>
After all, any methods of detection or tracking had distance limitations.<br/>
<br/>
According to the information left by Tian Shuang, the reason the Soul Devouring Sect knew of Ning Zhuo’s location was that after Ning Zhuo voluntarily revealed his identity in Twin Rivers Nation, through several transfers, they came to know of it.<br/>
<br/>
Only when Tian Shuang and Di Hui, carrying Qi Bai’s relics, arrived within the range of Thousand Peaks Forest did they begin tracking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thousand Peaks Forest - a certain mountain peak.<br/>
<br/>
Boom, boom, boom……<br/>
<br/>
Tian Shuang flew high in the sky, continuously bombarding Di Hui, causing shards of ice to fly about with thunderous sounds.<br/>
<br/>
Di Hui, with his heart in extreme agony, cried, “What kind of thing is this!”<br/>
<br/>
He did not dare to go deep underground for fear that Tian Shuang might lose track of him and return to Ning Zhuo’s side, or take other actions such as, feeling his sins were too heavy and committing suicide.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Di Hui had to keep Tian Shuang restrained, dragging him to a remote area to prevent other cultivators from seeing and scheming improper thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Di Hui had to admit that they had been defeated this time. This was the most abject encounter that the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, this pair of partners, had experienced in nearly ten years.<br/>
<br/>
“Tian Shuang, you fellow, you’ve even used this move!” Di Hui cried out in pain, his body covered in frost and in utter disarray.<br/>
<br/>
Tian Shuang’s face showed deep sorrow: “My partner, do not be so stubborn; quickly allow me to finish you off - this is my redemption, and also yours.”<br/>
<br/>
“Our sins are too heavy; only by repenting with death can we properly atone to all living beings.”<br/>
<br/>
Di Hui, so angry that his eyelids twitched, gritted his teeth and shouted, “Tian Shuang, listen to what you’re saying! I have recorded it all on the Jade Slips - when you return to normal, let’s see how you face me!”<br/>
<br/>
Tian Shuang turned a deaf ear, simply continuing to bombard relentlessly.<br/>
<br/>
While Di Hui fled in disarray, he kept shouting, “Record it, I have recorded it all for you!”<br/>
<br/>
Thousand Peaks Forest Frontline Main Camp.<br/>
<br/>
“Have these two cultivators - the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth - still not been found?” Lord Long frowned and admonished the other cultivators, “With so many of you, what exactly are you doing?!”<br/>
<br/>
The other cultivators all wore bitter expressions; one of them shook his head and said, “Lord Long, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth are no ordinary beings - they are experts of the Nascent Soul level. Coming from the Soul Devouring Sect, such a major demonic sect, even if they receive our flying messages, they simply will not pay us any heed.”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long fell into silent contemplation.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu, on the side, exclaimed, “The combined attack of Heaven and Earth is indeed formidable; in one strike, it caused Twin Rivers Nation to lose six or seven Nascent Soul cultivators.”<br/>
<br/>
“Now is exactly when the armies of Twin Rivers Nation are weak; it is most likely the opportune moment for us to deploy our forces in this war.”<br/>
<br/>
“If we can locate the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth and invest heavily to have them participate in the great war, our side could increase our chances of victory by at least twenty percent!”<br/>
<br/>
Then Lu Hongtu shifted his tone: “If we cannot find them, that would be most regrettable.”<br/>
<br/>
“Time waits for no one!”<br/>
<br/>
“If we delay any further, such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will be lost. Twin Rivers Nation, with their grand enterprises, must already be supplementing some Nascent Soul level cultivators at this time.”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long cast a glance at Lu Hongtu, knowing that the latter’s exclamation was in fact advice to him.<br/>
<br/>
After some thought, Lord Long said, “Let’s not wait for the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth; summon everyone - we shall launch a strong attack on the frontline camp of Twin Rivers Nation!”<br/>
<br/>
Twin Rivers Nation Frontline Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi frowned and questioned Liu Er, “Where is Ning Zhuo? Why hasn’t he returned yet?”<br/>
<br/>
“With the great war imminent, if the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth come to attack……”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, with a face of helplessness, spread his hands and said, “My lord, you know me; I, a mere half-human, half-demon, how could I possibly command the dignified Ning family scion?”<br/>
<br/>
“In fact, my Three General Camp had always been sponsored by him. He is the financial backer of my army - do I have the ability to really call him back?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi snorted coldly, “Since he does not obey military orders, the battle merits and rewards he seeks will not be granted so swiftly.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er stole a glance at Zhao Xi and, seeing his ashen face, hesitated for a moment before saying, “My lord, Master Ning Zhuo is a person of another nation; his family is not even part of Twin Rivers Nation. The only connection is his marital relationship with Mu Lan, but on that basis, he is still looked down upon - with an agreement that they will definitely separate in the future.”<br/>
<br/>
“Tell me, do you think such a person would be constrained by others because of battle merits and rewards?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Xi remained silent for a while, then pointed his finger at Liu Er and snorted coldly, “He indeed did not make a mistake in sponsoring you.”<br/>
<br/>
“Very well.”<br/>
<br/>
“Send these rewards to him as soon as possible.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hand them over to him in person!”<br/>
<br/>
“And tell him that if, in this great war, he can assist our army and hold off the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, our nation will offer a heavy reward!”<br/>
<br/>
“No, I will write a letter myself; you must deliver it to him in person.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er immediately saluted, “I shall obey, my lord!”<br/>
<br/>
After dismissing Liu Er, Zhao Xi was left alone in a room, letting out a deep sigh.<br/>
<br/>
This high position was too scorching for his backside.<br/>
<br/>
He could no longer sit still.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, he deeply regretted seizing power.<br/>
<br/>
He truly had not expected the second great battle to come so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
According to Zhao Xi’s plan, he had intended to rake in a huge amount of battle merits during this transitional period - he had not expected the transitional period to be so short!</div>
