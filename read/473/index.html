<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Grain route.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A stone sphere suddenly emerged from underground, cackling: “You dregs of the Two Note Kingdom, Lord Shi Zhong is here, hahaha.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Run, it’s Old Monster Shi Zhong!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“He’s come to attack the grain transport team again!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“You all go, I’ll hold him off.” The commander of the grain transport team was a Nascent Soul cultivator who rode forward on horseback to meet Old Monster Shi Zhong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The two fought fiercely, causing flowers of splendor to erupt in the sky, golden flames surging, burning large stretches of mountain forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Old Monster Shi Zhong’s demonic might was terrifying. The Nascent Soul officer lost his mount and suffered grievous injuries but did not retreat, fully displaying the military prestige of the Two Note Kingdom, stubbornly fighting on until reinforcements arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Old Monster Shi Zhong said: “Tang Yan, is it? Such strength with only early Nascent Soul cultivation, not bad, I’ll remember you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After tossing out these words of mutual recognition, Old Monster Shi Zhong fled underground, voluntarily retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">His earth-manipulation skill was truly exceptional, and the Two Note Kingdom’s Nascent Soul reinforcements could only stare helplessly at the layered mountains, sighing in vain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Because of this, when the second distribution of rations occurred, Mu Lan still did not receive any provisions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Good, good, good!” Mu Lan was furious to the point of laughter, her eyes full of mockery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This time, to prevent her from making trouble at the grain depot, Sun Gan and Shuang Jing both arrived together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The former had a cold expression, rebuking Mu Lan as a soldier who must obey military regulations and follow orders, putting on a show of great righteousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The latter advised her with a gentle smile, urging Mu Lan to be patient and more understanding of the nation’s difficulties. As the sole heir of the Mu Great Marshal’s Residence, she should set an example and display the spirit of sacrifice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Mu Lan was only at the Golden Core stage, her combat prowess relying largely on the Red Flower Battalion. She was no match for the Nascent Soul-level Sun Gan and Shuang Jing, so she could only grit her teeth, clench her fists, and rush out of the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Carrying deep guilt, she returned to the Red Flower Battalion, only to see the entire battalion rejoicing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Upon looking, she discovered that a large batch of provisions and pay had arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“From where did these military rations come?” Mu Lan was both surprised and curious. After asking, she learned it was the work of the Three Generals Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“What? Liu, Guan, and Zhang in the Three Generals Battalion are all penniless. Who else could it be? It must have been Young Master Ning.” Zhang Chongyi transmitted his voice to Mu Lan’s divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Ning Zhuo…” Mu Lan naturally knew the details of Liu, Guan, and Zhang, so she did not doubt Zhang Chongyi’s words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">She showed a complex expression and felt perplexed: “If he won’t engage in dual cultivation with me, why is he treating me like this?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Zhang Chongyi sighed: “Young Master Ning Zhuo has already told me the reason. It’s because of General Liu Er.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“He fell in love with General Mu at first sight and cannot bear to see you, General, in dire straits, or the Red Flower Battalion in danger, so he generously extended a helping hand.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Mu Lan immediately frowned: “This human-demon mixed-blood’s improper intentions still haven’t died out; it’s truly disgusting!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zhang Chongyi hurried to advise: “General, please think of the bigger picture. These rations came at just the right time. They are the lifeline of everyone in the Red Flower Battalion. If you implicate the entire army because of your personal likes and dislikes…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Mu Lan heaved a long sigh: “Ah! Uncle Zhang, rest assured, how could I fail to distinguish the weight of matters?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Golden Halberd Army was stationed inside Green Forest Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The main general’s residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Pang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">A tea cup was slammed onto the ground, shattering into pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Sun Gan, who threw the cup, was practically bristling with rage: “What is this Liu Er thinking?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“He’s just a mere human-demon hybrid, and he wants to lay hands on the Great Marshal’s Seal? Simply unaware of the immensity of heaven and earth!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“What love at first sight for Mu Lan? Who would believe such nonsense?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Utterly shameless!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">It was one thing for Shuang Jing to become a rival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun Gan acknowledged Shuang Jing’s status and position and admitted that the latter was a formidable enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">But who did Liu Er think he was?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">A mere mixed-blood daring to join the competition!?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Sun Gan felt utterly humiliated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">While he was mulling over how to retaliate against Liu Er, a subordinate reported that the White Jade Battalion’s main general, Lord Shuang Jing, was paying a personal visit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Gan was slightly stunned, then immediately understood. Shuang Jing must have learned that the Three Generals Battalion had taken action to solve the Red Flower Battalion’s predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Invite him to the reception hall,” Sun Gan ordered, promptly adjusting his attire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Soon, he moved to the reception hall and met with Shuang Jing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Shuang Jing wore a smile, but his tone was icy: “General Sun, I am here without beating around the bush, specifically for the Three Generals Battalion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Usually Liu Er acts all honest and simple, yet who would have thought he’d be so insidious, daring to steal the Great Marshal’s Seal right under our noses!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“He’s a human-demon hybrid, an outsider, and he dares to set his sights on Mu Lan. This is sheer foolishness!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“You and I should join forces to teach him and the Three Generals Battalion a good lesson, let him know that foolishness comes with a price!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Sun Gan did not bother with nonsense and immediately agreed: “I agree!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The two thus formed a private alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">That very afternoon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Cultivators from the Three Generals Battalion who entered the city to purchase provisions, making small additions to military supplies, were robbed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Not only did they lose their purchased goods, but they also lost three lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">When Liu Er heard this, he flew into a rage and immediately went to the Immortal City, seeking the city lord to catch the real culprits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">At dusk, the Golden Halberd Army suddenly left the city for training and happened to brush past a Three Generals Battalion unit that was out training as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“What are you staring at?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Staring at you, so what!?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“You little punk! Get him!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A conflict broke out as childishly as that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zhang Hei tried his utmost to maintain order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A Golden Core officer of the Golden Halberd Army insulted him and his entire family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zhang Hei was furious, grabbed his Black Serpent Spear, and charged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">At first, the Golden Core officer and Zhang Hei were evenly matched, but as Zhang Hei gradually increased his strength, the enemy suddenly let go, allowing himself to be run through by the Black Serpent Spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Zhang Hei froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Taking the chance, the Golden Halberd Army’s other Golden Core cultivators intervened, rescuing their severely wounded comrade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Zhang Hei realized something was amiss and was about to speak when Sun Gan suddenly appeared and struck directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He was a Nascent Soul expert, and the Golden Halberd Army was well trained and well equipped, not something Zhang Hei or the Three Generals Battalion could compare to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Although Zhang Hei resisted with all his might, the outcome was predetermined from the start.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhang Hei was taken captive by Sun Gan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Having achieved their sinister goal, the Golden Halberd Army immediately returned to the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">In the Three Generals Battalion…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“What?!” Guan Hong, upon hearing the soldiers who escaped back to camp cry about what had happened, learning that his third brother Zhang Hei was captured, grew so angry his face turned red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Instinctively, he stood and drew the Blood Dragon Blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">But after stepping out of the tent, he forced himself to calm down: “This is bad!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Right now, Big Brother is at the City Lord’s Mansion, and Third Brother has been seized by Sun Gan. If I go in anger, I surely won’t be a match for Sun Gan, and my end would be grim. It might even implicate Big Brother, forcing him to save yet another person later.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“For now, endure and wait…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Swish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">At the next moment, a white light flashed, so bright Guan Hong could hardly open his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">An assassin!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Guan Hong instinctively blocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Pfft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">His right arm was stabbed, and a large piece of flesh was sliced away on the spot, exposing a ghastly white bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Blood Dragon Blade cried out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In the next instant, a crimson light filled the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The assassin grunted, hit by the strike, and vanished without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He left Guan Hong half-kneeling on the ground, with the Blood Dragon Blade touching the earth, his face full of shock and rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Despicable!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“These people…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“Damn it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“If I’m attacked here, what about the strategist over there?”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
