<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Grain route.<br/>
<br/>
A stone sphere suddenly emerged from underground, cackling: “You dregs of the Two Note Kingdom, Lord Shi Zhong is here, hahaha.”<br/>
<br/>
“Run, it’s Old Monster Shi Zhong!”<br/>
<br/>
“He’s come to attack the grain transport team again!”<br/>
<br/>
“You all go, I’ll hold him off.” The commander of the grain transport team was a Nascent Soul cultivator who rode forward on horseback to meet Old Monster Shi Zhong.<br/>
<br/>
The two fought fiercely, causing flowers of splendor to erupt in the sky, golden flames surging, burning large stretches of mountain forest.<br/>
<br/>
Old Monster Shi Zhong’s demonic might was terrifying. The Nascent Soul officer lost his mount and suffered grievous injuries but did not retreat, fully displaying the military prestige of the Two Note Kingdom, stubbornly fighting on until reinforcements arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Old Monster Shi Zhong said: “Tang Yan, is it? Such strength with only early Nascent Soul cultivation, not bad, I’ll remember you.”<br/>
<br/>
After tossing out these words of mutual recognition, Old Monster Shi Zhong fled underground, voluntarily retreating.<br/>
<br/>
His earth-manipulation skill was truly exceptional, and the Two Note Kingdom’s Nascent Soul reinforcements could only stare helplessly at the layered mountains, sighing in vain.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, when the second distribution of rations occurred, Mulan still did not receive any provisions.<br/>
<br/>
“Good, good, good!” Mulan was furious to the point of laughter, her eyes full of mockery.<br/>
<br/>
This time, to prevent her from making trouble at the grain depot, Sun Gan and Shuang Jing both arrived together.<br/>
<br/>
The former had a cold expression, rebuking Mulan as a soldier who must obey military regulations and follow orders, putting on a show of great righteousness.<br/>
<br/>
The latter advised her with a gentle smile, urging Mulan to be patient and more understanding of the nation’s difficulties. As the sole heir of the Mu Great Marshal’s Residence, she should set an example and display the spirit of sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was only at the Golden Core stage, her combat prowess relying largely on the Red Flower Battalion. She was no match for the Nascent Soul-level Sun Gan and Shuang Jing, so she could only grit her teeth, clench her fists, and rush out of the city.<br/>
<br/>
Carrying deep guilt, she returned to the Red Flower Battalion, only to see the entire battalion rejoicing.<br/>
<br/>
Upon looking, she discovered that a large batch of provisions and pay had arrived.<br/>
<br/>
“From where did these military rations come?” Mulan was both surprised and curious. After asking, she learned it was the work of the Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
“What? Liu, Guan, and Zhang in the Three Generals Battalion are all penniless. Who else could it be? It must have been Young Master Ning.” Zhang Chongyi transmitted his voice to Mulan’s divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo…” Mulan naturally knew the details of Liu, Guan, and Zhang, so she did not doubt Zhang Chongyi’s words.<br/>
<br/>
She showed a complex expression and felt perplexed: “If he won’t engage in dual cultivation with me, why is he treating me like this?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi sighed: “Young Master Ning Zhuo has already told me the reason. It’s because of General Liu Er.”<br/>
<br/>
“He fell in love with General Mu at first sight and cannot bear to see you, General, in dire straits, or the Red Flower Battalion in danger, so he generously extended a helping hand.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan immediately frowned: “This human-demon mixed-blood’s improper intentions still haven’t died out; it’s truly disgusting!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Chongyi hurried to advise: “General, please think of the bigger picture. These rations came at just the right time. They are the lifeline of everyone in the Red Flower Battalion. If you implicate the entire army because of your personal likes and dislikes…”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan heaved a long sigh: “Ah! Uncle Zhang, rest assured, how could I fail to distinguish the weight of matters?”<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Halberd Army was stationed inside Green Forest Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
The main general’s residence.<br/>
<br/>
Pang!<br/>
<br/>
A tea cup was slammed onto the ground, shattering into pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan, who threw the cup, was practically bristling with rage: “What is this Liu Er thinking?”<br/>
<br/>
“He’s just a mere human-demon hybrid, and he wants to lay hands on the Great Marshal’s Seal? Simply unaware of the immensity of heaven and earth!”<br/>
<br/>
“What love at first sight for Mulan? Who would believe such nonsense?”<br/>
<br/>
“Utterly shameless!”<br/>
<br/>
It was one thing for Shuang Jing to become a rival.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan acknowledged Shuang Jing’s status and position and admitted that the latter was a formidable enemy.<br/>
<br/>
But who did Liu Er think he was?<br/>
<br/>
A mere mixed-blood daring to join the competition!?<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan felt utterly humiliated.<br/>
<br/>
While he was mulling over how to retaliate against Liu Er, a subordinate reported that the White Jade Battalion’s main general, Lord Shuang Jing, was paying a personal visit.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan was slightly stunned, then immediately understood. Shuang Jing must have learned that the Three Generals Battalion had taken action to solve the Red Flower Battalion’s predicament.<br/>
<br/>
“Invite him to the reception hall,” Sun Gan ordered, promptly adjusting his attire.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, he moved to the reception hall and met with Shuang Jing.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing wore a smile, but his tone was icy: “General Sun, I am here without beating around the bush, specifically for the Three Generals Battalion.”<br/>
<br/>
“Usually Liu Er acts all honest and simple, yet who would have thought he’d be so insidious, daring to steal the Great Marshal’s Seal right under our noses!”<br/>
<br/>
“He’s a human-demon hybrid, an outsider, and he dares to set his sights on Mulan. This is sheer foolishness!”<br/>
<br/>
“You and I should join forces to teach him and the Three Generals Battalion a good lesson, let him know that foolishness comes with a price!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan did not bother with nonsense and immediately agreed: “I agree!”<br/>
<br/>
The two thus formed a private alliance.<br/>
<br/>
That very afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators from the Three Generals Battalion who entered the city to purchase provisions, making small additions to military supplies, were robbed.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did they lose their purchased goods, but they also lost three lives.<br/>
<br/>
When Liu Er heard this, he flew into a rage and immediately went to the Immortal City, seeking the city lord to catch the real culprits.<br/>
<br/>
At dusk, the Golden Halberd Army suddenly left the city for training and happened to brush past a Three Generals Battalion unit that was out training as well.<br/>
<br/>
“What are you staring at?”<br/>
<br/>
“Staring at you, so what!?”<br/>
<br/>
“You little punk! Get him!”<br/>
<br/>
A conflict broke out as childishly as that.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei tried his utmost to maintain order.<br/>
<br/>
A Golden Core officer of the Golden Halberd Army insulted him and his entire family.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei was furious, grabbed his Black Serpent Spear, and charged.<br/>
<br/>
At first, the Golden Core officer and Zhang Hei were evenly matched, but as Zhang Hei gradually increased his strength, the enemy suddenly let go, allowing himself to be run through by the Black Serpent Spear.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei froze.<br/>
<br/>
Taking the chance, the Golden Halberd Army’s other Golden Core cultivators intervened, rescuing their severely wounded comrade.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei realized something was amiss and was about to speak when Sun Gan suddenly appeared and struck directly.<br/>
<br/>
He was a Nascent Soul expert, and the Golden Halberd Army was well trained and well equipped, not something Zhang Hei or the Three Generals Battalion could compare to.<br/>
<br/>
Although Zhang Hei resisted with all his might, the outcome was predetermined from the start.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei was taken captive by Sun Gan.<br/>
<br/>
Having achieved their sinister goal, the Golden Halberd Army immediately returned to the city.<br/>
<br/>
In the Three Generals Battalion…<br/>
<br/>
“What?!” Guan Hong, upon hearing the soldiers who escaped back to camp cry about what had happened, learning that his third brother Zhang Hei was captured, grew so angry his face turned red.<br/>
<br/>
Instinctively, he stood and drew the Blood Dragon Blade.<br/>
<br/>
But after stepping out of the tent, he forced himself to calm down: “This is bad!”<br/>
<br/>
“Right now, Big Brother is at the City Lord’s Mansion, and Third Brother has been seized by Sun Gan. If I go in anger, I surely won’t be a match for Sun Gan, and my end would be grim. It might even implicate Big Brother, forcing him to save yet another person later.”<br/>
<br/>
“For now, endure and wait…”<br/>
<br/>
Swish!<br/>
<br/>
At the next moment, a white light flashed, so bright Guan Hong could hardly open his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
An assassin!<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong instinctively blocked.<br/>
<br/>
Pfft.<br/>
<br/>
His right arm was stabbed, and a large piece of flesh was sliced away on the spot, exposing a ghastly white bone.<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Dragon Blade cried out!<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, a crimson light filled the sky.<br/>
<br/>
The assassin grunted, hit by the strike, and vanished without a trace.<br/>
<br/>
He left Guan Hong half-kneeling on the ground, with the Blood Dragon Blade touching the earth, his face full of shock and rage.<br/>
<br/>
“Despicable!”<br/>
<br/>
“These people…”<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it!”<br/>
<br/>
“If I’m attacked here, what about the strategist over there?”</div>
