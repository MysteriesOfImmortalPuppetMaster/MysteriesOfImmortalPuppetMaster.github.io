<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 87: Discussing Ning Zhuo</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“I have heard of such cases. Some people are just exceptionally suited to certain techniques, and their cultivation progresses extremely fast.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“What's his name? Ning Zhuo? He’s damn lucky to be a perfect match for the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Aiya, why couldn't something that good happen to me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The vast majority of people had never heard of the name Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">But now, his name was on everyone's lips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Inside the training ground, cultivators from the Ning Clan were also asking around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Being close to the source, many people surrounded Ning Zhuo, introducing themselves to him with smiles on their faces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">It was as if the entire world’s attitude toward Ning Zhuo had changed dramatically in an instant, from cold and indifferent to warm and enthusiastic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Chen and Ning Yong, who had originally been standing beside Ning Zhuo, were squeezed out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Yong felt honored and raised his arms, shouting, “Ning Zhuo is my classmate, he's my classmate!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">A young cultivator from the Ning Clan walking by heard this and turned his head with a sneer. “Who isn’t? He’s my classmate too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Yong let out a frustrated cry and glared, “But what kind of relationship do you have with him? Can you compare? Ning Zhuo and I are comrades who’ve faced life and death together!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">A Zhou Clan cultivator heard this and approached with a smile. “Little brother, from what you just said, you and Ning Zhuo have a close relationship?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Not bad,” Ning Yong nodded immediately, feigning indifference but unable to hide his pride.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Zhou Clan cultivator quickly cupped his fists and asked Ning Yong for advice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Yong was about to introduce Ning Zhuo, but Ning Chen gave him a tug, and Ning Yong immediately understood and stopped talking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Chen took over. “Both of us attended the academy with Ah Zhuo, and we’ve been through life-and-death situations together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Ah Zhuo is honest and sincere, friendly and brave. To be friends with him is our good fortune. He is also our role model. I remember back at the academy...” Ning Chen began to speak freely, launching into a glowing account of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The more Ning Chen praised Ning Zhuo in front of these inquisitive outsiders, the more it highlighted the Ning Clan’s foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Besides that, the experience in the Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern, as well as the later exposure of the black shadow demonic cultivator and their time hiding in the dungeon, had given them deep respect for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo and Ning Chen were from the Ning Clan’s branch family just like Ning Zhuo, and thus felt a strong sense of identification with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">For a time, Ning Zhuo had undoubtedly become the brightest star in the training ground. Because of his stunning display in this single cultivation test, he seemed to have stepped onto a whole new level of life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The testing continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The remaining Ning Clan cultivators entered the testing formation one by one, but their results were mediocre and drew little attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">It didn’t matter. Just Ning Zhuo alone had already shifted the entire situation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The joint test by the three clans was both a showcase and evaluation of each clan’s recultivation teams, as well as the basis for negotiating the benefits distribution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">In the world of cultivation, an extraordinary individual could stand above an entire group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">To compare the strength of the three clans, the most important measure was still their top cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Without Ning Zhuo’s performance, the Ning Clan would only have Ning Xiaohui at the peak of the third level. The Zheng Clan had Zheng Jian. The Zhou Clan had Zhou Zhu, but Zhou Zeshen also had an exceptional innate talent and was a prodigy on par with Zhou Zhu. His original cultivation base was just below Zhou Zhu’s, and in time, he would surely stand shoulder to shoulder with the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">So in terms of top cultivators, the Zhou Clan had one and a half and would rank first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Zheng and Ning Clans each had one prodigy, but the Zheng Clan’s other cultivators had significantly higher cultivation bases than the Ning Clan’s.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">With the expansion of the recultivation team, many of the Ning Clan’s cultivators had only a first-level cultivation base, not even worth mentioning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Therefore, the Zheng Clan should have ranked second, and the Ning Clan third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But with Ning Zhuo’s appearance, the Ning Clan now had two top cultivators and instantly rose to first place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Zhou Clan, with one and a half prodigies, moved to second.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Zheng Clan was pushed down to third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">After the joint test ended, the Ning Clan patriarch returned to the clan glowing with pride.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Though the distribution of benefits among the three clans still needed further negotiation, thanks to Ning Zhuo’s performance, the Ning Clan completely turned the tables. The outlook for the talks became bright and clear, dispelling the gloom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Ning Clan patriarch summoned the junior patriarch with a smile. “Xiaoren, something good happened in the martial arena today. You must have heard by now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Xiaoren answered immediately, “Father, I’ve heard. It was I who arranged for Ning Zhuo to join our recultivation team!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Ning Clan patriarch nodded. “Gather all the information on Ning Zhuo and compile it. I want to take a look later.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Xiaoren replied, “I’ve already ordered subordinates to do that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Ning Clan patriarch gave a noise of acknowledgment. “I suspect that Ning Zhuo may possess some kind of innate talent that just hasn’t been detected.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Xiaoren said, “There are countless types of talents. Even though our clan conducts tests every year, how could we cover everything? Your suspicion makes sense. We can rearrange the testing process and have Ning Zhuo retested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“But if he does have some kind of rare or strange talent, there’s a high chance it won’t show up in regular testing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Ning Clan patriarch nodded. “If he has a talent, that’s for the best. Even a low-grade talent would make him a prodigy! That way, our Ning Clan’s recultivation team can truly stand on equal footing with the Zhou Clan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Zhou Clan’s Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu both had innate talents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">So do Ning Xiaohui and Zheng Jian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">During the joint test among the three clans, Ning Zhuo’s cultivation base at the peak of the third level only showed everyone that the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation suited him extremely well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Xiaoren then said, “Father, isn’t it up to us to decide whether he has an innate talent or not?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Even if the tests don’t detect one and he’s just highly compatible with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation, it doesn’t matter. As long as we assign him one, we can proudly tell the outside world that yes, our clan has two prodigy cultivators!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Ning Clan patriarch shook his head. “That won’t do. This isn’t an internal clan matter. It’s not up to us alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“If we falsify something, the other two clans will definitely investigate and carry out their own tests. After all, this kind of power comparison directly affects our negotiation over the benefits distribution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“It wasn’t easy for us to establish a cooperation with the Zhou and Zheng Clans, and this time was mostly thanks to the Lava Immortal Palace. Our relationship with the two clans is much better than it used to be, so we must act with integrity. If we’re discovered to have fabricated something, it will damage our Ning Clan’s bigger picture.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Xiaoren nodded, indicating that he understood the lesson.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Ning Clan patriarch sighed. “And if Ning Zhuo really is found to have an innate talent, that’s not ideal either. Xiaoren, you understand what I mean, don’t you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Xiaoren nodded again. “I understand, Father. Ning Xiaohui is from our main family, while Ning Zhuo is from the branch family. Their current cultivation base is similar, but Ning Xiaohui has received significant support from our Ning Clan whereas Ning Zhuo has not.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“In the Ning Clan’s recultivation team, the people from the branch family greatly outnumber those coming from the main family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“On the training ground, as soon as Ning Zhuo revealed his true cultivation base, he was immediately surrounded and enthusiastically welcomed by members of the Ning Clan’s branch family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“If we later detect that he also has an innate talent, then we have to worry that Ning Xiaohui won’t be able to suppress him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Ning Clan patriarch showed a satisfied expression. “Since you understand this, I’m no longer worried about how you’ll handle the matter of Ning Zhuo. Go take care of it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“Yes, Father. Please rest assured, I will take care of this matter cleanly and beautifully. I take my leave.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Xiaoren’s feelings toward Ning Zhuo were complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sixteen years ago, during the Ning Clan’s migration, he had narrowly escaped an ambush by boarding the mechanical carriage of Ning Zhuo’s parents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">In order to ensure the mechanism carriage could break free, Ning Zhuo’s father had stepped down to block the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">That was how Ning Xiaoren survived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo’s father was truly his life-saving benefactor. Ning Xiaoren had even sworn on the spot to treat Ning Zhuo and his mother kindly and to fully support Ning Zhuo’s future cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Xiaoren did not keep that promise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo’s mother perished fourteen years ago. During Ning Zhuo’s growing years, Ning Xiaoren barely paid any attention to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He originally thought Ning Zhuo was just an ordinary child, but to his surprise, Ning Zhuo had suddenly started to shine, stunning everyone during the three clans’ joint examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">When he heard the news, his first reaction wasn’t delight. It was discomfort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He was feeling very awkward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">And there was lingering question in his heart: “Why did it have to be him?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">As Ning Xiaoren walked along the road toward his residence, he sighed to himself, “If only it weren’t Ning Zhuo. That would be so much better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“That kid is now sixteen years old. He already has his own thoughts and feelings, and won’t be so easy to influence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">In the midst of his reflection, Ning Xiaoren recalled something that Ning Ze had once said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Back when the results of the clan examination were announced, Ning Xiaoren had pressured Ning Ze several times in a bid to extort some money.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">At the time, Ning Ze had reported to him that Ning Zhuo had a reclusive personality, had grown independent, and no longer listened to his elders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Thinking of this, Ning Xiaoren made a decision. “It’s not suitable to approach Ning Zhuo in the short term.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“With his temperament, I can’t win him over with a few words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Ning Zhuo knows that his father saved my life, and he also knows that I’ve ignored him for the past sixteen years. All of this needs a proper explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“I’ll have to start with Ning Zhuo’s uncle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
