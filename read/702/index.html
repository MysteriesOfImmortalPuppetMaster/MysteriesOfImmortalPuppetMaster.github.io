<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo set down the Jade Slip containing his academy notes, his brow furrowing as he muttered, "This won't do..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"My aptitude for formations is inferior to Eldest Brother's, and probably even Shen Xi's."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"My talisman crafting skills lag behind Qing Chi's, and there are undoubtedly countless other geniuses my age who have already surpassed me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"It's frankly embarrassing. The Ning Clan excels in talisman crafting, yet I can't even decipher these two Demonic Talismans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"If I don't find some way to improve, I'll always be behind in my cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Moreover, all three of my Cultivation Arts are closely linked to Mechanical Arts. Mother specifically instructed me to focus on mastering it. Since Mechanism Art is essentially a synthesis of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation, I need to learn them all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"But with my limited aptitude and this slow learning pace, how will I ever master the Hundred Arts of Cultivation? It'll take forever!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Just as this thought crossed his mind, a Flying Message, drawn by Ning Zhuo's Qi signature, arrived outside the Green Stone Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sensing the message, Ning Zhuo immediately manipulated his token to slightly open the cave entrance, allowing the Flying Message to enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The message darted through the cave before landing in Ning Zhuo's hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After thoroughly inspecting it for any traps or hidden mechanisms, he finally probed it with his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"As expected, it's a letter from Wen Ruanyu." The spiritual energy signature on the Flying Message clearly identified the sender.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In his second letter, Wen Ruanyu mentioned that his duty report was taking far longer than he had anticipated. Given the current trajectory, he would likely remain under house arrest for some time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Through subtle signs and rumors, Wen Ruanyu had become convinced that various factions within the Myriad Manifestations Sect were actively vying for control of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Previously, only a few major powers had been involved, but now many smaller factions were seizing opportunities to wedge themselves into the conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The reason for this escalation was that the weaker among the major powers had proactively enlisted the support of smaller factions as allies. This alliance had inevitably led to the news leaking out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Using coded language, Wen Ruanyu warned Ning Zhuo that his existence was on the verge of being exposed. Despite Wen Ruanyu's best efforts to maintain secrecy, the situation was nearing its breaking point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Wen Ruanyu urged Ning Zhuo once again to prepare thoroughly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Moreover, he had proactively sought a way out for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Though confined to my residence, I have managed to reconnect with old acquaintances and learned much about the true state of affairs within various sects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Wen Ruanyu refrained from elaborating further, as discussing such matters in a letter was too risky. He merely advised Ning Zhuo to avoid becoming entangled in the Myriad Manifestations Sect's internal strife, especially concerning the Old Four Peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Above all, exercise extreme caution when dealing with matters involving Purple Thunder Peak among the Old Four Peaks!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Wen Ruanyu's warning aligned perfectly with Ning Zhuo's earlier insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo was far more composed than Wen Ruanyu had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"It's a pity I can't send a Flying Message to Wen Ruanyu," Ning Zhuo thought. "He'll have to worry for a while longer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Wen Ruanyu could send Flying Messages to Ning Zhuo because he had channels and old friendships that allowed him to maintain secrecy for the time being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">If Ning Zhuo were to send a Flying Message in return, it would be a self-incriminating act, revealing his position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">At the end of his Flying Message, Wen Ruanyu had mentioned: "Within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the number of Confucian cultivators is neither large nor small, but they have always been united, fostering friendships through literary gatherings and frequent exchanges."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"During this Flying Cloud Minor Trial, many Confucian cultivators are selecting promising juniors to replenish the sect's ranks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Young Friend Ning, although you primarily cultivate other arts and cannot simultaneously practice Confucian methods, I have already made arrangements. You can use this trial to join the Confucian cultivator community. For a short time, they will provide you with some protection."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Of course, they won't intervene directly, but they will offer discreet support."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo understood the Confucian cultivators' caution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Both he and Wen Ruanyu were about to become the focal points of the sect's internal power struggles, with various factions vying for influence around them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">If the Confucian cultivators drew too close prematurely, they would be dragged into the turmoil as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">As a group of Confucian cultivators, they typically observed the situation from the sidelines. They rarely led the charge in any conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But Ning Zhuo was already quite satisfied!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Wen Ruanyu was reliable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He was definitely one of their own!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Judging by Wen Ruanyu's arrangements and the Confucian cultivators' reactions, this group wasn't particularly large within the Myriad Manifestations Sect. If they had a powerful backer, they would have already begun vying for Ning Zhuo's favor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The benefits of the White Paper Immortal City were truly substantial!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Confucian cultivators' inherent cultivation arts limited them; they couldn't fully switch to the Myriad Phenomena Scripture, so most practiced it as a supplementary art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Moreover, Confucian cultivators had their own distinct pursuits, and their Dao Paths were already constrained by tradition. This made it difficult for them to ascend to the core echelons of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Despite these limitations, the Confucian cultivators were still willing to shelter Ning Zhuo, using the Rising Cloud Minor Trial to protect him. This method was remarkably clever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After all, it adhered strictly to the Myriad Manifestations Sect's rules.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Using the rules to advance personal interests was a characteristic approach of Confucian cultivators - efficient and safe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"The Confucian cultivators occupy an awkward middle ground, neither high nor low, making them an unsuitable entry point into the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"But since Wen Ruanyu recommended and arranged this, I should go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Gaining their protection in the short term will be advantageous for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Moreover... among the thousands of Cultivation sects, the Confucian school excels at learning above all others! Perhaps I can discover methods to accelerate my mastery of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation through them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Four Arts of the Scholar - zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting - are practically standard equipment for Confucian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">In other words, as a Confucian cultivator, one must master at least these four arts, and the deeper one's proficiency, the better. This doesn't even include the traditional Four Arts of Cultivation: Pill, Artifact, Formation, and Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Confucian cultivators learn far more than those of ordinary sects, partly because the Confucian school has extensively researched the art of learning itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Many Confucian techniques are specifically designed to enhance learning efficiency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Inkdot Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The dark rock walls were streaked with natural ink-like patterns, black pines stood tall, and the mountain mist hung heavy and damp. The winding path, like a jade ribbon, twisted upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Three cultivators ascended the dew-soaked stone steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The eldest among them was still a young man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The young cultivator didn't conceal his peak Foundation Establishment Qi. Dark circles ram his eyes, and though his hair was tied up, a few stray strands escape the bun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">As he walked, the bamboo slips in the poetry tube hanging at his waist clattered against each other, creating a rhythmic sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The young Confucian cultivator, Bai Jiyun, led the trio, his steps slowing as he gazed into the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A half-sun dipped behind a distant peak, painting the sea of clouds with a magnificent spectacle of molten gold and jade. Bai Jiyun couldn't help but sigh in genuine admiration. "Even if I fail the trial today, witnessing such beauty again makes this journey worthwhile."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Bai Jiyun was known for his leisurely and carefree nature, his love of travel and appreciation for scenic wonders, and his widespread literary fame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The two cultivators walking behind him caught up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The younger Confucian cultivator, Liu Fushu, said, "Brother Bai, you're being too modest. You're the face of Foundation Establishment Confucian cultivators in the Flying Cloud Kingdom. If you fail, none of us stand a chance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Liu Fushu was as slender as a bamboo stalk, his washed-out blue robes frayed at the cuffs. A calloused index finger on his right hand and a faint ink stain on his neck hinted at his dedication to calligraphy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Though only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, Bai Jiyun was well aware of Liu Fushu's reputation. Despite his humble background, Liu Fushu possessed remarkable talent in Confucian cultivation methods, particularly excelling in calligraphy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ironically, the Flying Cloud Minor Trial held at Inkdot Peak was a written examination. If Bai Jiyun grew complacent, he might very well lose to Liu Fushu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Liu Fushu's praise wasn't mere flattery; it stemmed from genuine admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Liu Fushu was much younger than Bai Jiyun. Ever since he began cultivating, he had repeatedly heard tales of Bai Jiyun's exceptional talent from his teachers. Every so often, news would spread among the Literary Cultivators about where Bai Jiyun was and what new poems or lyrics he had composed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In short, Bai Jiyun was Liu Fushu's idol.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Brother Bai," the third person present spoke up, "such breathtaking scenery demands a poem worthy of your talent! This humble one eagerly awaits your composition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The speaker was a young boy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">His cultivation was only at the Qi Refining Stage, his cheeks still plump with baby fat. He wore a short apricot-yellow robe, and his eyes shone as black as lacquer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">His name was Kong Ran, a renowned child prodigy of the Flying Cloud Kingdom. He was genuinely only ten years old, not an old cultivator using youth-preserving techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu treated Kong Ran as an equal, partly because of his distinguished family - he was the son of the Flying Cloud Kingdom's Prime Minister - and partly because of his innate talent, a significant advantage neither Bai Jiyun nor Liu Fushu possessed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Bai Jiyun smiled at Kong Ran before shaking his head. "I must conserve my Literary Qi for today's Flying Cloud Minor Trial. I can only blame my own lack of talent for failing to capture this magnificent view in verse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Kong Ran's small face grew serious, a hint of worry creeping into his expression. "Mr. Chu Xuangui is truly that strict?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Bai Jiyun nodded. "I've had the honor of encountering Mr. Chu Xuangui at several Literary Gatherings. He is the epitome of rigid fairness, meticulous to a fault. Though our conversations were brief, each one left me sweating bullets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Bai Jiyun's temperament clearly clashed with Chu Xuangui's, making them an ill-suited pair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Liu Fushu, however, gazed toward the mountain peak with reverence. "To personally meet Mr. Chu Xuangui today is a true honor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Mr. Chu once penned the Great Unity Chapter of Rites, forging a hundred-mile cloud wall amidst the sea of clouds to defend against ferocious demons and monsters for years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"It's a pity that after resigning from his post in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, he retreated into seclusion at the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">A pale gray morning mist shrouded the summit of Inkdot Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">As the three cultivators ascended, they found a middle-aged cultivator seated cross-legged at a stone table. He held a magic treasure-grade brush, meticulously practicing calligraphy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">They exchanged glances, softened their footsteps, and approached the cultivator in silence, standing quietly before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Only when the cultivator finally set down his brush did they offer a soft greeting and introduce themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The middle-aged cultivator was none other than Chu Xuangui. Dressed in a wide-sleeved white robe, his eyebrows were sharp as needles, his cheekbones prominent as inkstones, and his calloused fingers spoke of years of practice. He sat with impeccable posture, every movement precise and deliberate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, Kong Ran," Chu Xuangui's stern expression softened slightly. "The trial hasn't even begun, yet you've arrived first. Good. Early birds show true dedication to learning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">His praise sent a wave of elation through the three cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Wait quietly," Chu Xuangui instructed before falling silent again. He picked up a second sheet of paper and resumed practicing his calligraphy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Bai Jiyun stood motionless, longing to stretch but knowing Chu Xuangui's temperament well enough to suppress his restlessness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Liu Fushu, however, gazed intently at Chu Xuangui. Though he couldn't decipher the characters, he studied the movements of Chu Xuangui's arm and wrist, trying to grasp the profound mysteries of calligraphy. He became completely absorbed in the moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ten-year-old Kong Ran wanted to sit down and rest, but seeing Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu standing so rigidly, he suppressed his playful instincts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">As time passed, more cultivators gradually ascended the mountain and arrived at the summit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Like Bai Jiyun and the others, they first performed the proper Rites before standing quietly in place to wait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Many cultivators grew increasingly impatient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Fortunately, the trial's start time drew nearer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Kong Ran had long grown impatient, repeatedly sending messages via divine sense to Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Liu Fushu was already completely absorbed in Chu Xuangui's calligraphy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Bai Jiyun, though equally impatient, reassured Kong Ran: "This might be a deliberate arrangement by Master Chu Xuangui - a hidden test of our temperament."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Hearing this, Kong Ran's heart tightened, and he forced himself to remain still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">While everyone speculated, they remained unaware that Chu Xuangui himself was growing anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Why hasn't Ning Zhuo arrived yet? Time's almost up!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Within the Confucianism circles of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Chu Xuangui was a pillar of the community. However, his esteemed status stemmed not from his Golden Core-level cultivation, but from his mastery of calligraphy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Wen Ruanyu was another pillar. His painting skills were widely acclaimed among Confucian cultivators. Wen Ruanyu's self-portraits alone possessed the combat power of his True Form - a feat beyond the reach of most Confucian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Thus, despite Wen Ruanyu's years of cultivation in White Paper Immortal City, his standing within the Confucian cultivator community remained unshaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Upon returning to report for duty, Wen Ruanyu had sent a Flying Message in advance, notifying the Confucian cultivator circles of his arrival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">That's why Wen Ruanyu had previously urged Ning Zhuo to take his time and uncover the inner workings of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Although the Confucian cultivators within the Myriad Manifestations Sect didn't hold the highest positions, their status was far from low. They formed one of the most cohesive groups within the sect's middle ranks. Through frequent Literary Gatherings, they fostered camaraderie while exchanging vital information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">As a result, they possessed a deep understanding of the sect's overall dynamics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The moment Wen Ruanyu's report was met with house arrest, it triggered immediate alarm and concern among the Confucian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Each of them sprang into action, secretly lobbying for Wen Ruanyu's release.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Wen Ruanyu's request to ensure Ning Zhuo's well-being was also taken very seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">They were acutely aware of the immense value represented by White Paper Immortal City. While ghost-related materials and frigid resources were commonplace in the Underworld, they were rare and highly sought after in the Living Realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The Ghostly Black Marshlands' unique geographical environment could be considered a perpetually active Gate of the Underworld, requiring no massive resources to maintain its operation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">If this place weren't situated between the Flying Cloud Kingdom and the North Wind Kingdom, it would have lost its autonomy long ago if it were located in the heartland of either nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Confucian cultivator circles were far from oblivious to these strategic advantages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Wen Ruanyu's very existence had already given them a significant innate advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">His well-known admiration for Meng Yaoyin further solidified their position. Now that Meng Yaoyin's son was joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Confucian cultivators valued Ning Zhuo all the more because of Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">What they didn't realize was that Ning Zhuo's status in White Paper Immortal City surpassed even Wen Ruanyu's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">They chose to leverage the Flying Cloud Minor Trial to elevate Ning Zhuo's standing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Let this lucky brat gain early fame and take center stage. That alone will make many ill-intentioned individuals think twice before acting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">After deliberation, the Confucian cultivators settled on this strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Thus, Chu Xuangui, who hadn't organized the Flying Cloud Minor Trial in years, specially convened it this year.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"If Ning Zhuo doesn't arrive... I'll have to hold a second trial."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
