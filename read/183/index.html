<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 183: Refining the Mechanism</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the secret chamber, five Golden Core Stage Patriarchs from three families gathered together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"The alliance of the three families... has failed," Zhou Nuying sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zheng Danlian looked towards the Ning family patriarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The jade slip clearly stated that the key reason for the failure of this joint exploration of the Immortal Palace was Ning Xiaohui's internal conflict in public!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This behavior was extremely egregious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Ning family patriarch seemed completely unaware of the gaze directed at him: "Even if we had won this battle, it would still show the difficulty of exploring the Lava Immortal Palace. The path of soul entry into the Immortal Palace is not that easy." This analysis resonated deeply with the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Even though it was a regretful defeat, the Golden Core Stage Patriarchs of the three families all noticed the improvement in the combat power of Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In this battle, the materials of the two mechanical constructs were clearly of a higher grade than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Moreover, they used various novel mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The self-destructing ape mechanism, the wind fire wheel, the capturing rope mechanism that captured Ning Xie, all achieved significant combat results and were not to be underestimated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Naturally, the Golden Core Stage Patriarchs attributed such improvements to the Lava Immortal Palace and the deliberate arrangements of the three sects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">They would never have thought that there was a mastermind behind all this!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Even if the Qi Refining Stage juniors of the three families regroup and achieve good results, it is impossible to break through like a hot knife through butter. The path of soul entry into the Immortal Palace remains difficult."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"With Meng Kui possessing immortal potential, the reformation team of the City Lord's Mansion dominating the ranking list, it is difficult for our reformation team to defeat such opponents..." The Golden Core Stage Patriarchs exchanged thoughts secretly through divine sense and gradually reached a consensus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">That was: to set off together, cooperate with Zhu Xuanji, and delve into Fire Persimmon Mountain to reclaim the demonic general mechanism!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">From the perspective of the three families, they would rather see Zhu Xuanji ultimately obtain the Immortal Palace than Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">If Meng Kui obtained the Immortal Palace, the Meng family would move into the Immortal City in large numbers, greatly squeezing the living space of the three families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">On the other hand, if Zhu Xuanji won, the three families would have contributed to the royal family, which would undoubtedly be more beneficial for the three families' status in Fire Persimmon Immortal City!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zheng Shuangjun said, "Fellow Daoists, delving into the volcano is life-threatening. Before taking action, our family urgently needs to forge that mechanical weapon!" The other Golden Core Stage Patriarchs were slightly taken aback, then nodded simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Zheng family had obtained a mechanical blueprint from the Lava Immortal Palace in the early years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">According to the blueprint, the Zheng family spent a great deal of resources to secretly forge a mechanical weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">This weapon was extremely powerful and had already brought great benefits to the Zheng family even before it was completed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Previously, in a bet between the four Golden Core Stage Patriarchs of the Zheng and Zhou families, the Zheng family's two immortals entered the Night Star Silk Formation, relying on the advantage of this weapon to successfully break through the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Golden Core Stage Patriarchs of the Zhou family thus learned about this weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Zheng family proactively traded Nine Yang Yellow Ox Balm to gain the approval of the Zhou family's dual cultivators, who agreed to help the Zheng family complete the subsequent forging of the mechanical weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">But relying solely on the Zhou family's formation techniques was not enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Subsequently, the Zheng family intentionally approached the Ning family, hoping that the Ning family would provide powerful Extreme Cold Tempering techniques to help forge this mechanical weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">As a result, the Zheng and Ning families grew closer, secretly exchanging many benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">For example, Zheng Jian obtained the Ice Heart Talisman, and Ning Xiaohui, under the personal guidance of Zheng family cultivators, refined Ghost Weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Therefore, the Ning family patriarch was also aware of this mechanical weapon and had seen the blueprint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"If this weapon is forged, it will indeed be very helpful!" Zhou Nuying had a deep impression of the mechanical weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Ning family patriarch frowned secretly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">To be honest, he did not want to see the Zheng family master such a powerful weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">In his interactions with the Golden Core Stage Patriarchs of the Zheng family, he had seized upon this ambition of the Zheng family to secure many benefits for the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Ning family patriarch's plan was to use this mechanical weapon to keep the Zheng family on tenterhooks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But now, with the exploration of Fire Persimmon Mountain imminent, the Ning family patriarch also felt a sense of crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">If the Zheng family forged this weapon, it would indeed help ensure everyone's survival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Ning family patriarch furrowed his brows tightly, shook his head, and sighed, indicating that using Extreme Cold techniques would harm himself and greatly affect his combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He was unwilling to assist in tempering before delving into Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He preferred to find an opportunity to help the Zheng family after the trip to Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zheng Danlian and Zheng Shuangjun exchanged glances, seeing the determination in each other's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Ning family patriarch's refusal was within their expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">It didn't matter!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The dual cultivators of the Zheng family had their own methods to force the Ning family patriarch to comply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">That method wasâ€”Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The dual cultivators of the Zheng family found Zhu Xuanji and expressed that they had changed their minds and needed to forge a mechanical weapon before entering Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">And this mechanical weapon required the Extreme Cold techniques of the Ning family patriarch for tempering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Upon hearing this, Zhu Xuanji immediately expressed his willingness to help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He quickly found the Ning family patriarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">After a secret conversation, the Ning family patriarch, under pressure from the royal family, had no choice but to agree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo arrived at the clan leader's residence and met the Ning family clan leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Clan branch member Ning Zhuo, greets the clan leader!" Ning Zhuo cupped his hands, his manners impeccable, but his tone was indifferent and distant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Ning family clan leader, however, wore a smile and beckoned Ning Zhuo: "Come, Zhuo, sit here. Don't just stand there." Ning Zhuo remained expressionless: "Clan leader, if you have something to say, please say it directly. I still have some black market matters to attend to."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Haha, I know, I know you're a busy person." The Ning family clan leader laughed a few times, his tone gentle, "I called you here mainly for Ning Xiaohui's matter. You know..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo immediately interrupted: "Ning Xiaohui harmed me! Is the clan leader here to speak for her?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"It's not a setup, not a setup." The Ning family clan leader quickly denied, "We're all family, how could it be a setup?! Ning Xiaohui is just too young and made a mistake under pressure at a critical moment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Ning family clan leader emphasized in the end: "It was a mistake, indeed a mistake!" Ning Zhuo sneered coldly: "If the clan leader thinks so, I have nothing more to say. But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Do you really think so? Are you deceiving yourself?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Do all the clan leaders of the Ning family think so? Or do most people think so?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The smile on the Ning family clan leader's face grew even more pronounced: "That's why I specially invited you here, Zhuo, to clear up this matter. All rewards are negotiable!" Ning Zhuo was slightly taken aback, then his eyes lit up: "Oh?" Moments later, he left the clan leader's study, satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Once Ning Zhuo was confirmed to have left, the sound of things being smashed immediately echoed in the study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The noise continued for a long time before gradually subsiding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo secretly went to the underground base to meet Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong was very happy to see Ning Zhuo, jumping up and hugging Ning Zhuo's shoulders, patting him vigorously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Brother, you're here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Although the two had met many times in the Lava Immortal Palace, the actual number of meetings recently had been few.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Sun Lingtong stayed in the underground secret base all day, not seeing anyone, which made him quite bored.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Seeing his dear brother, Sun Lingtong was naturally very happy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">What made him even happier was that the two brothers were checking the biggest spoils of this battleâ€”a ghost cultivator Ning Xie!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Xie was sealed tightly with dozens of talismans stuck all over his body, unable to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Boss, how should we deal with him? Do you have any good ideas?" Ning Zhuo asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong shook his head: "If Cheng Bai had soul refining techniques, we could let him refine it. But now, his spirituality has dropped to fifty-six percent, it's impossible." Sun Lingtong sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Before the battle, Sun Lingtong had risked unsealing Cheng Bai's storage bag and used the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra to burn Cheng Bai's personal items, helping the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai regain a large amount of spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">His spirituality had once reached ninety-two percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But after the recent battle, Cheng Bai's spirituality had dropped significantly, now down to fifty-six percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Originally, Ning Xie, with his innate Snow Soul Ice Essence and being a ghost cultivator, was very suitable to be transformed into a ghost general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Cheng Bai's ghost generals had once suppressed Ning Zhuo, leaving a deep impression on the latter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But for the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai to regain soul refining abilities, he would need to pass the Spirit Movement Stage and develop strong spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This process was too slow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong preferred to use him now to enhance his own strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo understood: "So, we will refine him into a mechanical component?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Yes, yes!" Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Ning family was not like the Soul Devouring Sect or the Void Sect, large sects that could mark the culprits with the imprints of their disciples.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">This allowed Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong to deal with Ning Xie as they pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Without hesitation, they opened the furnace and threw Ning Xie into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Then, they both used the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra together, igniting the furnace and giving Ning Xie true peace in death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"It's too hot, too hot." Sun Lingtong finished the technique, letting the furnace cool down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He used his small palm as a fan, fanning his flushed, sweaty face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Suddenly, his eyes lit up, and he took out the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai, calling Ning Zhuo over: "Zhuo, come here." Cheng Bai had used the Soul Devouring Technique multiple times in the recent battle, eliminating several members of the reformation team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Boss, you go first!" Ning Zhuo quickly came to Sun Lingtong's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong didn't stand on ceremony, controlling Cheng Bai to infuse himself with a large amount of soul essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Comfortable, so comfortable!" Sun Lingtong closed his eyes, overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Zhuo, your turn." He absorbed half of the soul essence and then gave the position to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Subsequently, Ning Zhuo also received the nourishment of the soul essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Their soul foundations, which were over a hundred times stronger, were now making great strides towards the two hundred mark!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">After absorbing all the soul essence, both of them felt invigorated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The furnace had completely cooled down, and they opened it to take out a millstone-sized mechanical sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The surface of the sphere was covered with a layer of glazed casing, with a blue strip running around the middle like a blue belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">There were circular blue crystals at the poles of the sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Inside the casing, white mist constantly churned, sometimes expanding, sometimes contracting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The mechanical sphere floated in mid-air, emitting a faint chill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Spirituality: thirty-six percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Mechanismâ€”Ice Snow Weather Sphere!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
