<paragraph index="1">The morning light illuminated Fire Persimmon Immortal City. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Clouds and mist entwined around the mountain peak, but they couldn't conceal the increasingly frequent ominous sounds. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">It had been some time since the Lava Immortal Palace was blasted into existence, and more and more informed individuals began to understand: "Is that Immortal Palace acting up again?" Meng Kui looked down at the Immortal Palace, quietly watching as Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts appeared incessantly, assaulting the palace's defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Ning Family Patriarch gazed at the mountain journey, and after a while, received a report from the clan leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Two Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou family and two from the Zheng family are gambling and fighting, both entering the formation?" "Such a coincidence?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Ning Family Patriarch shook his head slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Regardless of whether this information was true or false, he decided to investigate personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Since Meng Kui had sealed off the mountain peak and personally taken command, the Ning Family Patriarch had not set foot in the Immortal Palace for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Hasn't Sun Lingtong replied to me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">It had been most of the night, and Ning Zhuo had not received a reply from Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He frowned deeply; this situation was very unusual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo paced back and forth in the room with his hands behind his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After a few rounds, he summoned a family servant: "There's quite a commotion on the mountain peak, what's going on?" "Go investigate, and if there are any other important news, report them as well." Soon after, the servant brought back explosive news from the market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo got what he wanted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Zhu Xuanji sought out Sun Lingtong?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Sun Lingtong deliberately spread his 'battle achievements' of repelling Zhu Xuanji, indicating his current real situation to me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Sun Lingtong is from the Void Sect and possesses the Void Emptiness Seal. Even if Zhu Xuanji abandons his principles and face, without evidence, forcibly searching his soul would yield nothing." "He still hasn't replied to me, what on earth happened?" Ning Zhuo frowned deeply: "Let's wait and see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Trusting each other... this was their agreement, a tacit understanding cultivated over more than a decade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">At that time, Ning Zhuo was only two years old.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">One day, Sun Lingtong returned injured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"What are you doing?" He found Ning Zhuo managing a small package, his face darkened involuntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">From this package, he saw supplies for entering the Crimson Flame Demon Lava Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo exclaimed in surprise: "Brother Sun, you're back! I was just about to look for you, ouch!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong couldn't help but give Ning Zhuo a flick on the forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"I'm going to explore the Crimson Flame Demon Lava Cave because I have the skills. What are you going for? To feed the demon beasts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"You're reckless and ignorant!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo covered his chubby little forehead with his hands, feeling aggrieved, "But, but Brother Sun, you were gone for so long this time, you were missing for a full seven days." Sun Lingtong's expression darkened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After recovering from his injuries, he would sneak into the Crimson Flame Demon Lava Cave every so often to search for his master's whereabouts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">There were no results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This time, the tunnel he entered collapsed midway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Fortunately, Sun Lingtong was on his way back at the time and decisively used the Void Traversing Technique continuously, narrowly escaping through the collapsed section and saving his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">However, finding the Lava Immortal Palace next would not be easy; he would need to re-explore and find a correct path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Of course, there was no need to share these worries with a two-year-old child.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Sun Lingtong patted his chest and smiled at Ning Zhuo, "You have to trust me, your brother is very strong!" "How about this, from now on, let's agree on ten days." "Within ten days, I will definitely come back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"So, as long as it's not more than ten days, don't worry. I'll be fine." Ning Zhuo weakly responded, "I understand." "Did you find your master this time in the tunnel?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun Lingtong: "Although I didn't see my master, I left some talismans in the passage. If my master leaves the palace, he should be able to sense them. Ahem." Sun Lingtong's breath weakened, "I got internal injuries this time. Please brew some medicinal decoction for me. Here's the prescription, I urgently need to replenish my qi." Ning Zhuo looked at the prescription and found that some medicinal ingredients were missing, so he went out to buy some.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">After Sun Lingtong checked, he found that many of them were fake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He asked Ning Zhuo about the whole process of buying the medicine, shook his head helplessly, and instructed, "You're just a child, buying from street vendors with your face covered, anyone would know something's wrong." "Next time, go to a big pharmacy openly and show your Ning family waist token." "Pretend you're buying medicine for an elder at home, no one will give you a hard time, and they'll give you genuine medicinal ingredients." "You're smart, but you lack experience in handling things!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Someone from the Ning family came.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The visitor smiled warmly and spoke gently to Ning Zhuo, trying to coax him into signing a contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong had already anticipated this and had told Ning Zhuo how to handle it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Following the plan, Ning Zhuo brought in his uncle, Ning Gui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo's face was as cold as ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He personally stepped forward, sternly reprimanding and thwarting the intruder's schemes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">However, afterward, he couldn't restrain Wang Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The latter stormed into the Ancestral Hall, causing a huge commotion, leaving the elders embarrassed and disgraced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo said to Sun Lingtong, "With such a big commotion, I'm afraid I will soon have to live with my uncle. Sigh, I really don't want to do that." Sun Lingtong patted his shoulder, comforting him, "Don't worry, your household registration transfer won't succeed. Your uncle will have to stay here for a long time." Ning Zhuo was curious, "Why?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Sun Lingtong explained, "On the surface, the elder of the Ancestral Hall was removed from his position, but he is still an elder, coming from the main branch with deep connections. It's just a temporary facade; he will surely be reinstated in the future. Your aunt's commotion caused a significant loss of face for the Ancestral Hall. However, the Ning family's branch doesn't have strong figures or factions to urge the Ancestral Hall to change its ways. Therefore, the Ancestral Hall is likely to remain obstinate, testing the reaction of the Ning family branch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"If the reaction isn't intense, they will detain your household registration as a warning to others. Although you will eventually be transferred to your uncle's house, they will delay it as long as possible. Your aunt mishandled this matter. But... she might not have done it unintentionally." Ning Zhuo's mouth slightly opened, listening in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong looked at his dumbfounded expression and patted his shoulder, "This is the adult world. You are too young, only two years old. Although you are very smart, adults are cunning. You have a lot to learn."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"For example, do you know the differences between gangs, families, sects, and nations? Do you understand how these forces operate?" Ning Zhuo could only shake his head, puzzled, "Are these important?" Sun Lingtong's face was serious, "Very important!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He then smiled, "Come, let me explain it to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong's teachings about the forces were vivid and memorable, as if they had happened just yesterday.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Gangs, for the most part, prioritize profit. The first-generation leader of the Monkey Head Gang had immense personal charisma, but he is now dead. The second-generation leader, Yuan Er, struggles to command respect, especially after Yuan Dasheng's death. Externally, old enemies harboring grudges wait for an opportunity to seek revenge. Internally, powerful elders covet Yuan Er's position as gang leader. Yuan Er faces both internal and external threats!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"There's no response from Boss Sun yet, so I'll start arranging my forces."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">While waiting for Sun Lingtong's reply, Ning Zhuo controlled the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng, attempting to infiltrate the Monkey Head Gang's base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He was already quite familiar with the Monkey Head Gang's base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">As a result, with a slight attempt, he succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He commanded the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng, smoothly entering the inner perimeter of the base, getting very close to Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Who would have thought the defenses at the Monkey Head Gang's base would be so lax!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"After the disastrous defeat at the Fire Persimmon Festival and the death of Yuan Dasheng, the entire Monkey Head Gang's prestige has plummeted, and the morale of its members has vanished."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"The hearts of the people are so scattered that even the main base's defenses are this poor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"No, something's not right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Perhaps this isn't just pure negligence; it's very likely that an elder has intervened and deliberately set it up this way." Ning Zhuo analyzed for a moment and thought of a possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The more he pondered, the more he felt this possibility was quite high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"If the gang's elders colluded with old enemies to assassinate Yuan Er, then I wouldn't need to trouble Boss Sun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"This way, it would save me a lot of trouble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Black Market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Sun Lingtong's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Inside the main house, the atmosphere was eerie and cold, filling the entire hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The investigating judge, like a deity statue in a temple, had eyes as sharp as knives, piercing through Sun Lingtong's soul, scouring his memories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo gradually grew up, reached the appropriate age, and after being tested, was found to have a spiritual root and went to the academy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He stayed at his uncle's house, living a repressed life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong, relying on the Void Sect's techniques, secretly met with him from time to time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">This was the brightest light in Ning Zhuo's dark life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun Lingtong stared at Ning Zhuo's exam results, his gaze sharp: "Little Zhuo, why are your grades so good this time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Have you forgotten what your mother told you before she passed away?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"You must hide your talents, you must conceal yourself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo lowered his head: "But the academy elder is a good person, he often encourages me and hopes I do well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"And those classmates, they always laugh at my poor grades, don't play with me, and think I'm stupid."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"But I'm clearly much smarter than them!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"I just wanted to show a bit of my strength and make them look at me differently!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong sighed inwardly: "Little Zhuo is smart enough, but as a child, he can't suppress his nature and is easily provoked."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"How should I persuade him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"No matter how I persuade, it's not reliable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Sun Lingtong thought for a moment and decided to use intimidation: "Little Zhuo, you're not far from death."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo was immediately frightened: "Ah?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sun Lingtong, with a grim face, listed many examples, telling him that many geniuses were killed out of jealousy, turned into pills, or used in artifact refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Your performance at the academy is too conspicuous; it could very well attract suspicion, leading them to judge your talent and kill you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo's face turned pale with fear, cold sweat covering his forehead. "B-but Ning Xiaohui also has talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Hmph, she is from the main branch, while you are from a side branch. Her grandmother is an elder of the family, and you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Have you forgotten what I taught you about cultivation families? Have you forgotten the current state of the Ning family that I analyzed for you?" Ning Zhuo shook his head repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Come, let's have a spar." Sun Lingtong thought for a moment, still not reassured, and decided to administer another strong dose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Following the content of the academy exam, Sun Lingtong performed everything in front of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Naturally, the results were outstanding, leaving Ning Zhuo far behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Sun Lingtong said, "I am only one year older than you. Look at my results. Am I proud? Am I complacent?" Ning Zhuo's face was pale, as if he had lost his soul, and he slowly shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sun Lingtong patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder. "Your Ning family has too few members, ranking last among the cultivation families in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Compared to your classmates, you might be quite excellent. But how do you compare to all the children in the entire Immortal City?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Fire Persimmon Immortal City is just a corner of the world, a new city built in the past century in the Southern Bean Immortal Kingdom. How do you compare to the children of the old cities?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Think about it, this is just the Southern Bean Kingdom. What about other countries?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Can you rank among the top in these countries?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Sun Lingtong shook his finger decisively, "No! You can't even compare to me, so don't get complacent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"I tell you, even in the Southern Bean Kingdom, I am only this much!" Sun Lingtong pinched the very tip of his little finger, belittling himself madly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo's face was pale, his forehead covered in cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Seeing the effect, Sun Lingtong patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder with satisfaction. "You must understand, there are always people better than you, and there is always a higher sky. Arrogant and conceited people are fools!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"You must always remain humble, open-minded, and keep a low profile to see reality clearly, to accept new knowledge faster, and to grow more quickly." At this point, Sun Lingtong had already made up his mind: from now on, he would personally spar with Ning Zhuo from time to time to keep him from becoming arrogant and impatient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo was silent for a long time before finally looking up at Sun Lingtong, his voice hoarse. "Brother Sun, I was wrong! My mother, before she passed away, actually always told me this too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Sun Lingtong sighed. "What I just said was actually taught to me by my master." The two looked at each other, and for a moment, they both fell into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
