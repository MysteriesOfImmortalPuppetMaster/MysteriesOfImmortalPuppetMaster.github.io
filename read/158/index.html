<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Once he collaborates with the Zhou and Zheng families, how will our clan view him?" "They will undoubtedly see him as a traitor to the family!!" "By then, his reputation will be ruined."<br/>
<br/>
"The key is, as his closest relatives, we will also be implicated. If Ji'er performs well in the future and has a chance to advance to higher levels, he will be eliminated solely because he is Ning Zhuo's cousin. Do you understand?!"<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan gasped, her face showing a look of panic, and she nodded repeatedly in nervousness: "I understand, head of the family, I understand!" "I will do my utmost to persuade Ning Zhuo to return to the reformation team!" "Even if, even if it means sacrificing my..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Ze was startled, then heard Wang Lan's words: "...sacrificing my dignity, I will kneel and beg him to return!" Ning Gui finally breathed a sigh of relief and added: "If you kneel, you must do it publicly; he won't be able to withstand it!" "And most importantly, don't be stingy with money when necessary. As long as I come out, there is hope, and we can recover everything we've lost." Wang Lan nodded repeatedly: "I understand, I understand, head of the family, I'm going!" "It must succeed." "Understood!"<br/>
<br/>
Watching Wang Lan's departing figure, Ning Gui, still uneasy, added another sentence: "If it doesn't succeed, we can think of another way, but don't do anything foolish." Wang Lan turned back, forcing a smile: "Head of the family, don't worry." Seeing Wang Lan's desolate expression, Ning Gui felt even more uneasy and worried.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren received a detailed report in his study.<br/>
<br/>
The report meticulously recorded the conversation between Ning Gui and Wang Lan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren nodded slightly, feeling satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of whether Wang Lan's persuasion succeeded or not, it would severely damage Ning Zhuo's reputation.<br/>
<br/>
At present, what truly restrained Ning Xiaoren from taking action was Ning Zhuo's reputation.<br/>
<br/>
As a victim of unfair treatment, he garnered immense empathy from the Ning family's branches!<br/>
<br/>
"If Ning Zhuo despises Ning Ze's family and develops a rebellious mindset, truly collaborating with the Zheng or Zhou families, that would be a fatal flaw." Ning Xiaoren's eyes gleamed with cold light, and he looked forward to it.<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan carefully prepared her appearance, waiting for the moment when Ning Zhuo was demonstrating spells to his classmates, the time when there were the most people.<br/>
<br/>
She barged into the courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo." She walked straight towards Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others curiously cast their gazes.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stopped casting his spell: "Aunt, do you have something to discuss?"<br/>
<br/>
Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Wang Lan walked up to Ning Zhuo, then suddenly knelt down, crying out: "Little Zhuo, your aunt is kneeling to you, begging you!" "Please save your uncle!"<br/>
<br/>
"He is your blood uncle, your only relative in this world."<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in the courtyard was shocked.<br/>
<br/>
Pa.<br/>
<br/>
Before anyone could react, Ning Zhuo also knelt down.<br/>
<br/>
He knelt on both knees, emotionally saying to Wang Lan: "Aunt, please get up! How can I accept such a grand gesture from you!" "Although we are not related by blood, you raised me to adulthood. I owe you a great debt and must repay it." "Although uncle embezzled my cultivation resources for over ten years, he is still my uncle." "If his life is in danger, I will do everything in my power to save him!" "Ning Chen, Ning Yong!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shouted in a low voice.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen and Ning Yong immediately stepped out from the crowd, lifting Wang Lan up from both sides.<br/>
<br/>
After Wang Lan stood up, Ning Zhuo also stood up.<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan cried: "Little Zhuo, you have wronged your uncle. He never embezzled or withheld any of your cultivation resources. That was a lie from the young clan leader, Ning Xiaoren!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed: "Aunt, what do you mean by this?"<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in the courtyard was puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan's next words gradually made everyone understand the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan said: "It was all Ning Xiaoren's scheme. He learned of your talent and wanted to recruit you, so he deliberately framed your uncle, accusing him of embezzling a large amount of cultivation resources.<br/>
<br/>
"But the truth is, he never gave any resources over the past ten years. He just wanted to drive a wedge between you and your uncle, so he could take advantage of the situation and win your favor." "He wants you to believe that he is the only one who treats you well in this world, to gain your endless gratitude and make you serve him in the future!" "What?!" Ning Zhuo was shocked, "Aunt, you can't say such things lightly..."<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan shook her head, her attitude firm: "This is indeed true, but our family didn't dare to speak out before because of Ning Xiaoren's power." "But this time, he has gone too far!"<br/>
<br/>
"He is using your uncle's life to threaten me, forcing me to use our family ties to pressure you, to make you return to the reformation team and accept all the unfair treatment." "I can't take it anymore, and neither can your uncle! He secretly contacted me, asking me to do this." "Because Ning Xiaoren's actions are pushing you and our family to a dead end." Everyone was stunned by these words, looking at each other in shock.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo lowered his head, furrowing his brows deeply, thinking for a long time before slowly raising his head: "Aunt, is everything you said true?" "Honestly, I am very hesitant right now because I don't know who to believe!"<br/>
<br/>
Wang Lan was prepared, gritting her teeth: "Ning Xiaoren framed your uncle and fabricated a lot of false evidence. I have collected quite a bit, and you should have some as well." "He hastily tried to drive a wedge between you and your uncle, so there must be many flaws in the false evidence!" "And another thing, if Ning Xiaoren had been providing you with resources for over ten years, there would definitely be traces left, it couldn't be completely empty." "You just need to investigate, and you can prove everything!" "Alright." Ning Zhuo shouted, "Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and fellow classmates." "I ask for your help to thoroughly investigate this matter before tonight!" The classmates, having received many favors and not being on a battlefield, did not hesitate and all responded.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren's initial framing of Ning Ze was indeed rushed and could not withstand such meticulous scrutiny.<br/>
<br/>
As the small flaws were pieced together, the truth gradually became clear to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
"The young clan leader actually did such a thing!"<br/>
<br/>
"He was never a good person. I remember my grandfather's pension was also withheld by him."<br/>
<br/>
"With him around, our clan can never have fair rewards and punishments. Look at Little Zhuo, he has talent and ability, and we admire him greatly. If such a talented person is treated like this, what about us?" For a moment, the crowd was in an uproar.<br/>
<br/>
"The time is ripe." Ning Zhuo thought to himself.<br/>
<br/>
He decisively made a request, hoping everyone would help spread the news, letting as many people know as possible.<br/>
<br/>
"This is intolerable!"<br/>
<br/>
"Does Ning Xiaoren really deserve to be the young clan leader?"<br/>
<br/>
"I want to go to the clan's ancestral hall and demand an explanation!" Ning Zhuo raised his arm and shouted.<br/>
<br/>
The others responded: "Let's go, let's go!"</div>
