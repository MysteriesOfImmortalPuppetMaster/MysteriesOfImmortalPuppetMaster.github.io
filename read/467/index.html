<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 467: Ning Zhuo, I Want to Dual Cultivate With You Even More!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Upon seeing Ning Zhuo’s reaction, Liu Er felt greatly satisfied in his heart and secretly thought: “Indeed, I have seen through this noble young master Ning Zhuo. My words have stirred his righteous indignation and sense of justice!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo clenched his fist and immediately helped Liu Er devise a plan: “General, if you wish to seek marriage with General Mulan, you will inevitably have to face Sun Gan and Shuang Jing.”<br/>
<br/>
“In that case, the Three Generals Camp is likely to suffer difficulties and suppression.”<br/>
<br/>
“And that would not even be the worst.”<br/>
<br/>
“Once our army is deployed to the front line, both Sun Gan and Shuang Jing hold positions far above ours. They might use their influence from higher up to issue military orders that we cannot refuse, yet are exceedingly arduous!”<br/>
<br/>
“Moreover, Generals Guan Hong and Zhang Hei are very resentful and disgusted with how the Red Flower Camp previously threw their enemy onto our side.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt slightly surprised at sensing Liu Er’s confidence, and this made him grow suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er immediately waved his hand: “Leave Second Brother and Third Brother to me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Even if I must face off against Shuang Jing and Sun Gan, I will still fight!”<br/>
<br/>
“I never expected Liu Er would also chase after Mulan.”<br/>
<br/>
“What love at first sight, what admiration? Nonsense!”<br/>
<br/>
“He must be aiming to get his hands on the Grand Marshal’s Seal!”<br/>
<br/>
“Yet his confidence is quite abundant. Why? What trump card does he hold?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s thoughts drifted; the more he pondered, the deeper he went.<br/>
<br/>
He even thought that Liu Er’s participation in this battle, organizing an army, might have, apart from establishing meritorious deeds, one main goal: approaching Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
“If Liu Er has a trump card and prepared early on to approach Mulan, then there must be a force behind him, and that force is no small matter.”<br/>
<br/>
“I had only just secretly discussed matters with Zhang Zhongyi not long ago, and Liu Er already learned of it. Could it be that the military camp is not safe, and Liu Er possesses some ability to obtain intelligence?”<br/>
<br/>
After discussing with Liu Er for a while, Ning Zhuo took on the mission of stepping forward on Liu Er’s behalf to express his intentions to Mulan’s side.<br/>
<br/>
Because the situation was tense, Liu Er worried that Mulan might be pressured into agreeing to either Shuang Jing or Sun Gan, so he urged Ning Zhuo to act as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then left the Three Generals Camp and went to Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The situation had become more complicated.<br/>
<br/>
Not only Ning Zhuo himself, but even Sun Gan, Shuang Jing, and Liu Er all aimed for the Grand Marshal’s Seal.<br/>
<br/>
“But here is a key issue—”<br/>
<br/>
“Even if one dual cultivated with Mulan and obtained the status of a Dao partner, it would not necessarily represent a marriage contract, let alone grant the Grand Marshal’s Seal.”<br/>
<br/>
“In fact, even Mulan herself, as the sole heir of the Grand Marshal’s Residence, does not currently hold the Grand Marshal’s Seal.”<br/>
<br/>
It was precisely because of this that Ning Zhuo had refused Zhang Zhongyi’s proposal for dual cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
If at that time he had taken advantage of the situation to propose becoming Dao partners, it would certainly have drawn the resentment of Zhang Zhongyi and Mulan, making them think he was a petty scoundrel who seized the opportunity when others were in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
“Therefore, this matter cannot be rushed.”<br/>
<br/>
“Shuang Jing and Sun Gan, as well as Liu Er, cannot be unaware of the differences between dual cultivation and the Grand Marshal’s Seal. Yet they still did it. This can only mean that they have follow-up methods to further utilize their connection with Mulan and obtain the official positions they desire!”<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo pondered, he sent a flying message to Zhang Zhongyi.<br/>
<br/>
After receiving the letter, Zhang Zhongyi also welcomed Ning Zhuo into the military camp.<br/>
<br/>
This time, inside Zhang Zhongyi’s tent, Ning Zhuo directly met with Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was in the midst of treating her injuries.<br/>
<br/>
She looked at Ning Zhuo: “Family-inherited cultivation methods indeed cannot be leaked casually. But if you and I dual cultivate and become Dao partners, that restriction will no longer apply.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: “I have already explained this to Lord Zhang.”<br/>
<br/>
“A person cannot stand without trust.”<br/>
<br/>
“And General Mulan devotes herself to the Grand Marshal’s Residence, while I am also working hard for the Ning family. General Mulan should sympathize with my determination.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan gave a cold snort.<br/>
<br/>
She became increasingly irritated in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
Her looks were by no means inferior, and she was born into the Grand Marshal’s Residence. Moreover, she was a Golden Core-level warrior maiden of a military family. Yet in asking an unfamiliar man to dual cultivate —and not just once, but multiple times —she was repeatedly refused!<br/>
<br/>
This was a situation she had never anticipated.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan looked expressionlessly at Ning Zhuo: “Young Master Ning, can your family compare to my Grand Marshal’s Residence?”<br/>
<br/>
“If you became my Dao partner, you could move the Ning family to Twin Rivers Kingdom.”<br/>
<br/>
“I believe that with the status of the Grand Marshal’s Residence, it would certainly bring more development opportunities for your Ning family.”<br/>
<br/>
“Compared to marrying a female member of the Zhu Family’s imperial clan, wouldn’t it be better to board the great ship of the Grand Marshal’s Residence? The difference between the two is obvious, is it not?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: “General Mulan, your words are mistaken!”<br/>
<br/>
“No matter how small the Ning family may be, it is still the place where I was born and raised.”<br/>
<br/>
“The ancestors’ vision and experience are richer than mine, and their decision to migrate to Southern Bean Kingdom was not solely the will of my family’s Golden Core forefather.”<br/>
<br/>
“Back then, when they passed through Twin Rivers Kingdom on their journey to Southern Bean Kingdom, they must have considered many factors.”<br/>
<br/>
“Today, the Ning family has already taken root in Lava Immortal City and is developing splendidly. How could I, for my own sake, burden the family with another migration and disrupt its promising prospects?”<br/>
<br/>
“If I truly did that, how would I face the relatives who died during the migration, and those who are striving tirelessly in Lava Immortal City?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: “I would have no face to meet them!”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan fell into silence.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi looked at Ning Zhuo with even greater admiration in his eyes, and sincerely praised: “Young Master Ning Zhuo is indeed a dragon among men, a gentleman of utmost sincerity, and truly loyal and filial!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cupped his hands: “Lord Zhang overpraises me. This junior has come today because I have orders to carry out.”<br/>
<br/>
“In fact, our Lord Liu saw General Mulan at first sight and…”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo conveyed Liu Er’s statements to Mulan and Zhang Zhongyi.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan and Zhang Zhongyi exchanged glances.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi’s expression was complicated, and he fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan let out a cold laugh and said, “I never thought that once I, Mulan, lost one battle, I would fall into such decline and allow the entire Grand Marshal’s Residence to be so greatly belittled. And now, a mere human-demon half-blood actually dares to covet the Grand Marshal’s Seal!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly stated that General Mulan had misunderstood. General Liu Er truly had sincere intentions, and at present, he definitely counted as an excellent choice.<br/>
<br/>
These words caused Mulan to lapse into silence.<br/>
<br/>
According to her personality, she would never yield to Sun Gan or Shuang Jing. Otherwise, it would be more straightforward to just kill her.<br/>
<br/>
Yet now Mulan’s injuries had not recovered, her personal combat strength had plummeted, and Red Flower Camp could barely protect itself, unable to offer any aid.<br/>
<br/>
With the military pay running low, both Mulan and this army were forced to the edge of a cliff; one more step forward and there would be an abyss of no return!<br/>
<br/>
From Mulan’s inner feelings, Liu Er did seem more pleasing to the eye than Sun Gan and Shuang Jing.<br/>
<br/>
And yet more pleasing than these three was Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
Regrettably, Ning Zhuo had no such thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was not someone who gave up easily. She fixed her gaze on Ning Zhuo’s eyes, raised her chin slightly, and said in a forceful, domineering tone, “I want to dual cultivate with you even more! Whatever conditions you want, just state them. My Grand Marshal’s Residence still has its own foundation.”</div>
