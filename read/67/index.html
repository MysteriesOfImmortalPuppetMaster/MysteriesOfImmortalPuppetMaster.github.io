<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 67: Explosion</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The moment the fire persimmon was crushed, it immediately exploded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Yuan Dasheng had been placing all its attention on Yuan Er, the thousand-year fire persimmons, and the surrounding explosive fire monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Not once had it considered that it could make a mistake!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Such a thing was simply impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">After picking fire persimmons for so many years, the necessary motions had already been engraved into its instincts. How could it make a mistake?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">But the reality was that it indeed made a mistake!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">At that moment, the ape‚Äôs eyes widened in fury. It stared helplessly as the fire persimmon in its hand exploded, setting off a chain reaction of devastating explosions all across Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This was the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At the moment of life and death, Yuan Dasheng suddenly remembered that Yuan Er was still in the forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Without hesitation, it rushed back toward Yuan Er to protect him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Then, with Yuan Er in its arms, it tried to flee Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But Fei Si wouldn‚Äôt allow it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Fire Persimmon Forest was the basis of Fire Persimmon Immortal City‚Äôs most important industry. This harvest was his responsibility, and the crowning achievement of Sir City Lord‚Äôs tenure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Every section of Fire Persimmon Forest was isolated by formations to prevent any chain explosions from destroying the entire forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The moment the explosion started, this section of the Fire Persimmon Forest was locked down, sealing Yuan Dasheng and Yuan Er inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">BOOM BOOM BOOM...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The chain explosions began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Yuan Er trembled uncontrollably, his whole body shaking like a leaf. His eyes were shut tight and he was gripping Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs fur, screaming, ‚ÄúUncle Monkey, Uncle Monkey! I‚Äôm going to die! We‚Äôre going to die!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Yuan Dasheng held him in its arms, turning its back to protect him from the exploding Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The whole forest erupted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Fire soared to the sky, surging like a colossal crimson lotus blooming in the world and giving rise to endless heat that could melt all metal and iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Terrifying flames and shockwaves swept everywhere, filling all the space enclosed by the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Under this crushing pressure and at the moment of life and death, Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs face distorted in pain. All of its instincts screamed at it to use the Demonic Pollution Blood Muscle Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">But a thought flickered through its mind, and it hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">On the mountainside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs face was filled with shock, and the flames from the explosion illuminated his youthful face in red. However, there was an inerasable chill in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">‚ÄúSuccess!‚Äù His heart pounded, and joy flooded his whole body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He had truly wracked his brain to design this trap and kill Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Under this terrifying explosion, Yuan Dasheng would be in real danger. It would have to go all out for just a sliver of a chance at survival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">But could it really go all out? Could it possibly expose its Demonic Pollution Blood Muscle Technique?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">If it did, it was guaranteed to be hunted down!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After all, that was a bona fide demonic technique. If it were in secret, there might be some leniency. But after exposing it in full view, which righteous path figure would dare to shield the ape?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">As of right now, the four great forces were unaware of the help Yuan Dasheng could provide them in regard to exploring the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">They had joined together to fully focus on hunting the black shadow demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">If someone suddenly used a demonic technique at this moment, how would they react?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Time seemed to slow to a crawl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The red flames of the terrifying explosion gradually swallowed up Yuan Dasheng and Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Yuan Dasheng clutched Yuan Er tightly in its arms. Falling into a daze, it seemed to see Yuan Yi‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Yuan Yi ran over joyfully, holding Yuan Er up in front of Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">‚ÄúDa Sheng, look! This is my child! My son!‚Äù Yuan Yi was overjoyed. ‚ÄúI have a son now. I have a descendant in this world!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Yuan Dasheng grinned, genuinely happy for its friend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Yuan Yi handed the child straight to Yuan Dasheng, who looked overwhelmed as it hurriedly received him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Yuan Dasheng carefully held the tiny baby in its palm. Despite the swaddling cloth separating them, it could feel the baby‚Äôs warmth and fragility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">All of this touched something deep inside it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Yuan Yi smiled at Yuan Dasheng. ‚ÄúYou like him too, huh? That‚Äôs great‚Äîcough cough cough!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Before he could finish speaking, Yuan Yi began coughing up blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Yuan Dasheng quickly looked up at him, crying out with concern in its eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yuan Yi casually waved his hand. ‚ÄúMy old injuries, you know how it goes.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He wiped the blood from his lips and spat out another mouthful of blood. Ignoring the piercing pain in his body, he smiled. ‚ÄúWe climbed up from the bottom and killed our way to our current height. Of course there‚Äôd be a price to pay. Right, Da Sheng?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The ape gave a few low chuckles. The scars all over its body were the best answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Yuan Yi stretched out his arms and took a deep breath. ‚ÄúThis life has been worth it!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Then, in a calm voice, he said, ‚ÄúI did it, in the end. This kid‚Äôs mother is no longer alive. Hmph, that woman thought she could act all high and mighty just because she gave birth to a son. Now that she‚Äôs gone, her family‚Äôs people and assets all belong to us!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">‚ÄúI told you that I‚Äôd make her regret it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">‚ÄúI told you that I‚Äôd pay back the humiliation I suffered tenfold. I didn‚Äôt lie, did I, Da Sheng?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The ape nodded, and its expression as it looked at the baby grew noticeably gentler.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yuan Yi also looked at the baby and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm naming him Yuan Er. Da Sheng, my lifespan isn‚Äôt as long as yours.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">‚ÄúWhen the day comes that I‚Äôm gone‚Ä¶ let Yuan Er take Yuan Yi‚Äôs place[^1] and stay by your side.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Yuan Er started crying from hunger. In order to feed him, Yuan Dasheng squeezed some juice from a peach the size of a washbasin. In the end, Yuan Er was drenched like a drowned rat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Yuan Er fell ill. That night, Yuan Dasheng dashed through the immortal city like the wind, charging into a clinic and grabbing the doctor by the neck. It bounded along with the doctor in its hands as screams shattered the silence of the moonlit night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Yuan Er started learning to climb. He clung to Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs thick fur as if challenging mountain peaks. Each time he fell, Yuan Dasheng‚Äôs palm caught him perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Yuan Er gradually grew up. Yuan Yi, on the other hand, grew weaker by the day, and was bedridden for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">In the end‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yuan Yi looked at his ape friend. With his final flash of life, he shouted, ‚ÄúDa Sheng! I, I‚Ä¶‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Yuan Dasheng cried out in response, but unlike before, it could no longer hear Yuan Yi‚Äôs next words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Yuan Yi lay on the bed, eyes wide open and mouth agape. There was no more vitality in his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The ape stood silently, like a stone statue. Its face showed no expression, but there seemed to be thunder from the heavens raging in its ears, filling its mind with deafening booms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">BOOM!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The roar of the explosion seemed to shake the heavens. The terrifying blast was like a primordial beast that instantly devoured Yuan Dasheng and Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Then, the explosion was halted by the formation. Blinding crimson light flooded the entire formation zone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Just a few breaths later, the firelight faded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The onlookers people could see inside the formation again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The once lush Fire Persimmon Forest had nearly vanished, replaced by scorched earth and a field of desolation as far as the eye could see. Only a scant few persimmon trees remained standing, their trunks reduced to pitch-black charcoal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The next moment, as hot wind swept through, the charred trunks cracked apart and scattered across the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Yuan Dasheng was half-kneeling on the ground like a statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">As Yuan Er stirred in its arms, the ape suddenly collapsed to the ground with a dull thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Its flesh was torn and mangled, and its back was destroyed to the point that its white spine was visible. All its fur was gone, with its skin blackened and scorched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Its eyes were tightly shut and its teeth were bared. Its face was set with searing agony and the strain of giving everything it had.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Yuan Er‚Äôs expression was blank with shock. He slowly turned his head, taking in his surroundings in a daze. Then, he shuddered and suddenly snapped to his senses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He quickly checked himself and realized he had only suffered some minor injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">It was a miracle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Yuan Er could hardly believe it. The moment the explosion occurred, he thought he was dead for sure! He never imagined he would survive, let alone in such good condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">[^1]: Reminder that Yuan Yi is ‚ÄúYuan One‚Äù and Yuan Er is ‚ÄúYuan Two‚Äù.</paragraph><br/><br/>
