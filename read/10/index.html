<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 10: The Volcanic Cave</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The lake of lava was like a golden glass bead, gorgeous and eye-catching at the center of the field of red rock. Reddish-golden lava churned slowly in the lake, with huge bubbles occasionally rising to the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Waves of hot air spread out from the lake, rolling across the rocky field before impacting the crater walls. At that point, the heat rushed along the walls up to the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo and Ning Yong stood at the edge of the volcano‚Äôs mouth, their bodies trembling violently at the waves of heat buffeting their faces. Although Ning Zhuo guarded his mouth and nose with magical power, the heat still singed the tips of his hair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhanji glanced at the embarrassing state of the newcomers, and calmly ordered: ‚ÄúGive them each a set of magic robes[^1].‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">His subordinates immediately tossed the two some spare robes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo took a look at the set of robes and found that it was extremely comprehensive. There was a helmet, a top, pants, outer robes, outer armor, boots, etc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The robes were also covered in talisman runes, most of which were frost-type.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">‚ÄúA talisman treasure.‚Äù This thought flashed in Ning Zhuo‚Äôs mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Talisman treasures were different from magic artifacts. They were consumable items that would wear out after many uses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The advantage of talisman treasures was that they were cheap. As long as some talismans were added on top of a base material, anything could become a valuable talisman treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The small wooden hammer that Ning Zhuo had designed for himself was also a talisman treasure. This had allowed him to easily refine the petroleum mud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Currently, all the cultivators in the Ning Clan‚Äôs exploration team were wearing these magic robes. Obviously, the Ning Clan had specially designed this equipment for the sake of obtaining the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After putting on the robes, Ning Zhuo immediately felt that the heat in his surroundings had returned to normal levels. Moreover, the smell of sulfur had also disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">There were several hanging platforms jutting out from the crater walls, each populated with city guards. On the one hand, they were there to guard the crater; on the other, they were for collecting fees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhanji chose a hanging platform and led the team to officially step into the volcanic crater.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Yong was jumping in excitement, full of curiosity as he looked around. Ning Zhuo‚Äôs face also showed a mixture of excitement and anxiety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhanji‚Äôs target was nothing other than the lava lake at the center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Their team of over 50 cultivators immediately attracted attention. Aside from Ning Zhuo‚Äôs group, there were several other teams and even many solo cultivators scattered around in the crater.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">From time to time, even more cultivators came down from atop the crater walls. Some people went through the official hanging platforms, but most would use ropes to climb down by themselves. However, these cultivators generally found descending difficult due to being constantly buffeted by waves of hot air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Nevertheless, the ones who climbed down by themselves could avoid paying fees on the hanging platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The city guards could see these cultivators bypassing the platforms, but they didn‚Äôt move to stop them; rather, they turned a blind eye and remained indifferent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo gradually approached the lake of lava. As he neared, he discovered that there was actually biological activity going on inside the lava lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">When lava bubbles burst, red-furred fire velvet rats would jump up and soar on the rising hot air to hunt in the sky among the white smoke. If they succeeded, the rats would come back down holding smoke larks and smash them on the rocks below. Thanks to the constant waves of hot air rising into the sky, the fire velvet rats could easily land without hurting themselves every time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Some cultivators would wait for these fire velvet rats to land, then use special artifacts to capture them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs thoughts turned slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">‚ÄúFire velvet rats are resistant to heat and can swim in magma. They prey on birds, and their most valuable part is their fur. If you collect hundreds of pelts and sew them together, you can make a fur robe with strong fire resistance.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">At that moment, at the front of the team, Ning Zhanji suddenly stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">In front of him was one of the holes that led into the cavern. Compared to the other entrances nearby, there was nothing special about this one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">However, Ning Zhanji‚Äôs expression was certain. He whispered: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs here. Get ready to enter.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The cultivators in the team silently obeyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">One cultivator in the lead formed hand seals and pushed his palms forward, causing a wave of snowy mist to burst out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This snowy mist poured into the hole, immediately covering the tunnel walls with a layer of frost. Rumbling sounds echoed out as cold energy sank deeper and deeper into the cavern, and in the end, huge globs of mud spurted out from the hole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The mud geysered into the sky, catching on fire and blooming like fireworks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo knew that this extra-flammable substance was petroleum mud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">After all the mud was expelled, Ning Zhanji immediately jumped into the hole. The rest of the cultivator followed closely behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Chen, Ning Yong, Ning Zhuo, and the other newcomers were led by the veterans to jump in one by one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">In the moment he jumped into the hole, Ning Zhuo shivered from the chilly air surrounding him. But the deeper he went, the higher the temperature rose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">By the time he was halfway down the tunnel, the surroundings had become extremely hot. As he slid along the walls, Ning Zhuo carefully sensed the changes in the tunnel walls around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">At first, the tunnel walls were covered in frost, but by the halfway point, any frost had long disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">When he finally landed with his feet on the ground, Ning Zhuo looked around and found himself in an underground world full of fire and rocks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The rocky ground beneath his feet was somewhat soft, and the orange-yellow cavern walls around him gave off endless waves of heat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Yong curiously reached out to touch the rocky walls of the cavern. In an instant, one third of the talisman runes on his glove melted away, scaring him into immediately retracting his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Fortunately, another Ning Clan cultivator quickly took action, bringing out a jade bottle and releasing an ethereal mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The mist condensed into bluish-white ribbons that floated in the air, surrounding the team and keeping the pervasive heat at bay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhanji arranged for Ning Zhuo and the other newcomers to stay at the center of the team, then led them to continue forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Once the novelty wore off, the scenery of the Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern quickly grew monotonous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Yong kept muttering to himself, wondering when the monster beasts would show up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Chen‚Äôs initial alertness gradually relaxed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">As for Ning Zhuo, he secretly marveled at the density of the spirit energy here, which was the highest out of everywhere he had ever been.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">‚ÄúNo wonder many powerful cultivators seclude themselves in remote and dangerous places.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">‚ÄúUnfortunately, my current magical power is frost-type magical power. The spirit energy here is aligned with the fire element, and contains a lot of fire poison. It‚Äôs an unsuitable environment for me.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The path in this underground cavern was sometimes wide and sometimes narrow, leading ever downward. There wasn‚Äôt only a single passage; Ning Zhuo saw many forks in the path as they walked. However, the Ning Clan cultivators were obviously familiar with the route, choosing a direction without hesitation every time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">‚ÄúFire crystal grass. Rooted in rocks, its leaves are translucent like crystals. It constantly absorbs heat from the earth and exudes firelight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">‚ÄúFlame shadow flower. It absorbs magma and poison, and its stalk is a purplish black. Its leaves are as thin as cicada wings, and the flower doesn‚Äôt move at all; however, its shadow dances like flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">‚ÄúVigor ginseng. It grows by absorbing the energy of the earth, and undergoes a qualitative transformation every 130 years. This kind of ginseng has long and thin whiskers, and is blessed with the innate ability to escape through the earth.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Along the way, Ning Zhuo saw several kinds of spirit plants. When the team passed by, some people would be assigned to pick them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhanji glanced imperceptibly at Ning Zhuo, then waved to the newcomers and asked: ‚ÄúDo you know why we‚Äôre picking all these spirit plants?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">[^1]: Magic robes ‚Äì Ê≥ïË°£ ‚Äì This word actually refers to a Buddhist monk‚Äôs robes. The character Ê≥ï in this case would mean ‚ÄúDharma‚Äù. However, Ê≥ï can also mean ‚Äúmagic‚Äù (as in ‚Äúmagical power‚Äù) and these guys aren‚Äôt Buddhists, so I‚Äôm rendering it as ‚Äúmagic robes‚Äù.</paragraph><br/><br/>
