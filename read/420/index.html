<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 420: Sworn Brotherhood in the Pear Orchard</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Seeing that Ning Zhuo and his companion had left the camp, Zhang Zhongyi immediately called a servant boy: "Go and fetch General Mu Lan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Before long, a female general lifted the curtain of the tent and walked in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">She had a dignified and heroic appearance, with distinct facial features. Her sharply defined jawline exuded a determined temperament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Her gaze was firm and sharp, with a high nose bridge and beautifully shaped lips that were slightly pressed together, revealing an undeniable resolve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The female general had her jet-black long hair tied up high into a ponytail, with a few strands left at her forehead, appearing valiant and spirited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">She was tall and fit, with tight and well-proportioned muscles, showcasing the results of years of training and combat. Especially notable were her long, strong legs; every step she took was decisive and forceful, exuding strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">She wore a set of simple bronze armor and draped a bright red cloak over her shoulders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Her hands were clad in black leather gloves, reinforced with brass at the palms and fingertips. She wore black leather high boots that were both durable and non-slip, with thick brass plates on the soles, uppers, and around the calves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Uncle Zhang, you wanted to see me?" General Mu Lan immediately spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhang Zhongyi nodded. "Mu Lan, a young hero just came by, tirelessly seeking medical help for a friend."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"This person has considerable strength and a deep background. Despite only being at the Foundation Establishment stage, he possesses Golden Core combat power. He could be a strong ally for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo had revealed his Buddhist healer, Meng Yaoyin â€”a mechanical puppet undoubtedly at the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He also demonstrated the ability to find an Earth-element Grandmaster cultivator, indicating deep connections and a wide network.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">A Dao injury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Could an ordinary person sustain such an injury without venturing into extraordinary places?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">General Mu Lan showed a slight wry smile. "Uncle Zhang, as the saying goes, 'All is fair in love and war.' You've only heard about him, but as a commander, I can't take things lightly. I need to investigate and confirm Ning Zhuo's identity and so on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zhang Zhongyi became anxious. "Niece Mu Lan, you've joined the army in place of your father, but you have too few reliable people by your side."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Old General Mu has been bedridden for a long time. Many at court covet the position of Grand General."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"You now hold the Grand General's military seal but are only at the Golden Core stage yourself. You really need support. The tasks assigned by the court are arranged for the Nascent Soul level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Celestial City of Green Forest is in the rear, yet you're being ostracized and targeted here. The White Jade Camp set up right opposite the Red Flower Camp, deliberately doubling their recruitment fees â€”full of malice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Recently, our recruitment efforts have been ineffective. The cultivation levels and numbers of the soldiers we've attracted are declining."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"A young man like Ning Zhuo is truly a rare find. If other camps discover his potential, they'll surely compete to recruit him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"After all, he can be considered to have Golden Core combat power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Mu Lan was silent for a moment, then showed a resolute expression. "Uncle Zhang, what you say is reasonable. But that's not my way of doing things."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"My achievements and fame should be earned by me personally, using my own bow and horse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"This is my way of warfare!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The female general spoke decisively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhang Zhongyi was momentarily stunned, then sighed. "You and your father are carved from the same mold in temperament."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"But you have to understand, times have changed..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Just as Zhang Zhongyi was about to persuade her further, Mu Lan cupped her hands and interrupted, "Uncle Zhang, if there's nothing else, I'll return to the main tent. I have a lot of military affairs to handle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">After saying this, Mu Lan turned around without looking back and walked straight out of the medical camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo sat on the second floor of a tavern, looking out the window directly at the city gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The city walls were built with massive bluestones, wide enough for two war chariots to pass side by side. On both sides of the gate stood towering towers equipped with mechanical crossbow carts, manned by soldiers. Small patrol squads came and went from time to time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The city gate was a huge wooden door, black as ink, with clear growth rings. The bluestone ground under the gate had been worn smooth by countless footsteps, even slightly sunken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Inside the gate, along both sides, many notices were posted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Among them, the largest and most conspicuous was the "Recruitment of Worthies" notice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73"><div style=" padding: 8px; font-style: italic;">"Demons and evils run rampant in the Thousand Peaks Forest, disturbing the people's hearts. Now, a grand army is organized to sweep away the wicked and restore clarity to the land.<br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Therefore, we specially recruit heroes from all over the world to eliminate the demons and uphold the righteous way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Any aspiring person may sign up to join the army. The monarch swears by the fate of the Two Noted Nation: rewards will be based on military merit, fair and impartial!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Foundation Establishment cultivators who join the army will receive the rank of squad leader; Golden Core cultivators will be directly appointed as Roving Generals. Other positions will be awarded according to merit. Those with achievements will be granted noble titles, benefiting their wives and children, with glory for generations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"This is a grand event of the righteous way, to sweep away all evil and restore peace to our land. May talented individuals respond, contribute to the nation, achieve great deeds, and return the world to brightness and clarity."</paragraph></div></paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Below was the seal of the monarch of the Two Noted Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Naturally, the cultivators reading this recruitment notice were the most numerous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo was also at the second-floor window, silently observing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He overheard the discussions among nearby patrons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"If you're going to join the army, naturally you should choose the one with the highest pay. General Shuangjing's White Jade Camp is the first choice!" said a cultivator with small, shrewd eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Hmph," another cultivator with thick hair and rabbit ears shook his head. "There are too many young masters in the White Jade Camp. If you want a good atmosphere, General Xu Dali's Barbarian Demon Camp is fairer."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">These words immediately drew rebuttals from others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Although the Barbarian Demon Camp has many people, they're just a rabble. They're useful for easy battles or cleaning up the battlefield. If you really want to achieve merit, you have to go to General Lu Chi's Fire Cloud Camp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">A bald cultivator shouted loudly, "As long as you have some fire-element spells, after joining, you can attack the battlefield from afar, killing countless enemiesâ€”not only safe but also easily gaining lots of military merits!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Hmph! A bunch of greedy people," a young cultivator with a black mole at the corner of his mouth said indignantly, standing up and looking around as he raised his arms to shout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"If you really want to join the army, the best choice is the Red Flower Camp!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Not to mention anything else, just that the Red Flower Camp was established by Old General Mu, who has made countless meritorious contributions to the kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Right now, Old General Mu is bedridden; General Mu Lan has joined the army in place of her father and needs us heroes to fully assist her. Joining the army is to serve the country, not just to think about rewards and merits. Such cultivators â€”we are ashamed to be associated with!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Such provocative words immediately aroused the displeasure of the surrounding patrons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">A quarrel broke out immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Several groups each chose their preferred camps and cursed at each other. Among them, the small-eyed man, the one with big buck teeth, the bald man, and the young man with the mole were the representatives, arguing until their faces were red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Just then, a local cultivator appeared from the city gate area. He was seven feet six inches tall, had four ears, and arms that reached past his knees. He came to the recruitment notice next to the inner city gate, looked at it for a long time, and sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">In the crowd, a burly man was displeased. "What are you sighing about? A real man should just join the army!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The local cultivator turned back to look at the speaker, seeing that he was eight feet tall, had a short neck, and a face full of black beard like steel needles. His aura was surging, reaching the Golden Core stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The local cultivator asked, "May I ask your name, hero?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Heh!" The black-bearded man laughed. "My surname is Zhang, given name Hei, courtesy name Feisheng. I have recently moved to Celestial City of Green Forest and enjoy making friends with heroes. Seeing you sighing at the notice, I spoke up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The local cultivator sighed. "I am originally a royal kinsman of the Blood Remnant Dynasty, surname Liu, ranking sixth among siblings, so I am called Liu Er."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Now, seeing that the kingdom wishes to conquer the Thousand Peaks Forest, I aspire to defeat the rebels and bring peace to the people but hate that I am alone and powerless. Thus, I sighed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhang Hei laughed heartily. "I have considerable wealth, and my cultivation has reached the Golden Core stage. Although you conceal your aura, you should be at the same level. Why don't we join together and undertake great deeds?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Liu Er was delighted upon hearing this and immediately invited Zhang Hei. "Brother Zhang, you have a keen eye. Come, let's eat and talk."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">With that, he led Zhang Hei into the nearest tavern to drink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The two entered the hall, went up the stairs, passing the second floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The quarrelling voices of the small-eyed man, big buck-teeth, bald man, and the young man with the mole naturally diminished due to the arrival of the two Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Liu Er and Zhang Hei reached the third floor, found a table to sit at, eating and talking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">During their conversation, a big man, travel-worn and dusty, flew directly in through the third-floor window, shouting, "Waiter, quickly get me some wine. I'm hurrying to go outside the city to join the army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Liu Er saw that this big man had a Golden Core aura, was nine feet tall, with a beard eight feet long that nearly reached his feet, and a face glowing redâ€”quite majestic. He invited, "This hero, we two are also going to join the army. Since we are on the same path, why not come and drink with us first?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Golden Core big man saw this, glanced at the two, and readily agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After sitting down, he introduced himself, "My surname is Guan, given name Hong, courtesy name Maicheng. I usually enjoy the 'Spring and Autumn Annals of Military Strategy' and have studied it extensively. This time, hearing that the Two Noted Nation is raising a grand army to start a war, I came to enlist and test my military strategies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Although the three had just met, the more they talked, the more congenial they felt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">After several rounds of drinking, the atmosphere among the three became even more enthusiastic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">At this moment, Ning Zhuo took out some White Jade Wine and approached them proactively. "Three seniors, I am Ning Zhuo from the Ning family of Huoshi Immortal City in the Southern Bean Nation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"By coincidence, I also wish to join the army to avenge my family's enmity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Years ago, the Six Cave Sect of Thousand Peaks Forest betrayed an agreement and schemed against my clan, almost leading to our annihilation. I am small and weak and was considering which camp to join. Seeing the three of you full of heroic spirit, clearly not ordinary Golden Core cultivators, I wish to attach myself to you and humbly ask you to accept me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Liu Er, Zhang Hei, and Guan Hong looked at each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">They had originally intended to join together and enlist in a camp, but from Ning Zhuo's words, it seemed he thought they wanted to set up their own faction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Life hangs by a thread!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Eh?" Ning Zhuo's heart trembled silently. The 'Life Hanging by a Thread' technique landed on Zhang Hei and Guan Hong's heads but missed Liu Er's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He tried again, but it deviated once more. Ning Zhuo quickly withdrew his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Heart Demon Seal of the Buddha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He secretly influenced Zhang Hei and Guan Hong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Guan Hong stroked his beard and pondered, "According to the recruitment notice, if we Golden Core cultivators join the army, we'll all be given the position of Roving General."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Although it's a miscellaneous titled general, it does allow us to command an army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo smiled and interjected, "The three generals are full of heroic spirit and grand aura. Even just seeing you once, I deeply believe that commanding an army independently befits your abilities!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Zhang Hei laughed heartily. "Well said! If we three work together and command an army, we can look after each other and be relatively free, not too constrained. On the battlefield, we can act according to our wishes, advance and retreat freely, and gain more military merits!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Liu Er pondered silently without speaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo said, "Three generals, why not drink while talking? This is the White Jade Wine unique to my family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Fine wine matches heroes; White Jade Wine has an icy and refreshing taste, which complements your heroic spirit perfectly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Please allow me to pour wine for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Liu Er hesitated, Guan Hong was self-assured, but Zhang Hei laughed heartily. "Kid, if the wine is good, we'll take you in!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo proceeded to pour wine for the three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The White Jade Wine was indeed unique; after tasting it, the three Golden Core cultivators all nodded in approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">They continued their conversation, with Ning Zhuo standing by, occasionally pouring wine and interjecting, pushing the atmosphere to new heights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Under Ning Zhuo's assistance, the three felt that the more they drank, the more congenial they became, regretting not having met sooner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Zhang Hei said, "I have an estate in Celestial City of Green Forest. Behind it is a pear orchard, and the pear blossoms are in full bloom now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Why don't we three go to the pear orchard, offer sacrifices to heaven and earth, become sworn brothers from now on, work together with one heart, and then accomplish great things."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Liu Er and Guan Hong said in unison, "Good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo clapped his hands. "Such a grand and elegant affair! Please allow me to witness it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"You speak nicely, so we'll bring you along," Zhang Hei nodded, grabbed Ning Zhuo by the collar, took big strides, and flew out of the window.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Guan Hong followed closely behind. Liu Er was the last to leave and, before departing, placed some spirit stones on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The three arrived at the pear orchard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Zhang Hei immediately had servants prepare black oxen, white horses, and other sacrificial offerings, then lit incense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Seeing Ning Zhuo standing by in white robes, Zhang Hei became more enthusiastic. "You kid, I like the look of you. Why not join us in the worship today and become brothers too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo's heart skipped a beat, but he showed a look of joy on his face. Just as he was about to speak, Liu Er coughed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Guan Hong gave Ning Zhuo a sideways, contemptuous glance. "A mere Foundation Establishment cultivatorâ€”how can he be on par with us Golden Cores?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Seeing that the two were displeased, Zhang Hei laughed awkwardly and waved his hand at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo secretly breathed a sigh of relief but appeared very disappointed on the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Then, Liu, Guan, and Zhang knelt together and swore, "Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei, though of different surnames, now become brothers. We will work together with one heart, help those in distress; serve the country above, bring peace to the people below. We do not seek to be born in the same year, month, and day but only wish to die in the same year, month, and day. Heaven and Earth, witness this heart. If we betray righteousness and forget kindness, may both heaven and man strike us down!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">After the oath took effect, the three looked at each other and laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Zhang Hei said, "Although we are brothers, we should determine who is elder and who is younger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The three arranged for Ning Zhuo to wait outside and went into the training ground to spar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">After a short while, they emerged from the training ground, having determined the outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Liu Er was the eldest brother, Guan Hong the second, and Zhang Hei the third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Liu Er looked troubled and proactively suggested, "Now, we need to consider recruiting soldiers and buying horses. But I am alone and have little wealth; we three brothers might as well pool our resources."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Zhang Hei laughed heartily, pointing around. "I have considerable wealth; let me contribute. How much can mere recruitment cost?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Guan Hong stroked his beard and reported a figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Zhang Hei's expression immediately froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo stepped forward. "Three generals, I come from the Ning family and am willing to offer precious materials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Saying this, he took out Xuanhuang Mother Stone, Blood Fiend Demon Stone, and Netherworld Black Soil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">These were precious materials obtained from the corpse of the Old Stone Monster, each at the Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"I have considerable wealth... hmm?" Zhang Hei was about to refuse, not believing that a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator like Ning Zhuo could offer anything valuable. But upon seeing the items, his eyes bulged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Guan Hong's beard-stroking hand froze mid-action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Liu Er was also greatly shocked, looking at Ning Zhuo with new respect and beginning to regret not having included him in their brotherhood earlier!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
