<paragraph index="1">Sun Lie’s mouth was slightly agape after hearing this. A while later, he shook his head. “Extremely few. So as it turns out, the real treasure of the Lava Immortal Palace isn’t the mechanical arts inheritance? Instead, it’s the techniques that allow you to establish a foundation with three paths and three dantians?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Fei Si nodded. “Sir City Lord is wise and far-sighted. How could we randomly guess at his thoughts?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Mechanical arts has always been niche among the hundred arts of cultivation. What’s so good about the inheritance?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“The triple foundation techniques are the truly valuable treasures!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Sun Lie nodded and sighed. “So that’s how it is.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Meng Chong clenched his fists, full of fighting spirit. “I’m going to obtain the techniques of the three schools and cultivate the upper, middle, and lower dantians at the same time!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“I can’t wait. Old Sun, quick, tell me how to use my Ferocious Rushing Thunder to disperse my power!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sun Lie laughed. “It’s very simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“At this point, you should be able to actively control your Ferocious Rushing Thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“When you disperse your power, just activate the Ferocious Rushing Thunder at the same time to speed up the process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Ferocious Rushing Thunder is a talent with a wide array of usages. It’s not only useful for dispersing power; it can also improve the rate at which you accumulate magical power later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“In the heat of battle, it can bless you with the power of thunder and counter yin-aligned opponents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“If an ordinary cultivator wants to learn a divine ability, they have to start with a lifebound spell. But your Ferocious Rushing Thunder immortal talent is equivalent to the seed of a divine ability. If you continue to strengthen and improve it, it will eventually turn into a true divine ability!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“There are other applications as well. You’ll slowly learn about them in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“But you should remember that this talent consumes your three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit. You mustn’t use it excessively.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Meng Chong made a noise of acknowledgment and cupped his fists in gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lie looked at Fei Si again. “Han Ming has repeatedly come to attack me, and is completely obsessed with the Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Considering her identity as a disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect, I tolerated her and didn’t pursue her transgressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“But today, she actually tried to kill me! She and I are henceforth mortal enemies!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Those six Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellets all have an odorless medicinal fragrance I added. Let me concoct a pill for you; once you take it, you’ll be able to smell the medicinal fragrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Follow the medicinal fragrance, and you’ll find the Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellets! Even if they’ve already been taken, as long as the fragrance hasn’t been detected and cleansed, you can still track them down for a few months.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Although Sun Lie was a rough person, he had lived in the world of cultivation for so many years already. He wasn’t some harmless herbivore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He had cleverly arranged a situation to stimulate Meng Chong’s nature. How could such a person lack in schemes?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Fei Si nodded and changed his attitude. “As expected of a master alchemist. I misunderstood you previously. Please forgive me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He was a Golden Core cultivator. His politeness toward someone in the Foundation Establishment stage won some respect from Sun Lie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun Lie was also an old hand, so he nodded slightly and no longer mocked Fei Si, instead giving praise in a meaningful voice. “Sir City Lord has a good subordinate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">After dividing the spoils, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo, in the guise of Hanging-Hair Traveler, said their farewells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo’s voice was hoarse and his expression was inscrutable. “Boss Sun, thanks for your help. I will remember this favor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Sun Lingtong chuckled and said, “In that case, why don’t you reconsider my proposal from last time?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Join the Spaceless Sect?” Ning Zhuo shook his head. “Not interested.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo was a member of the Ning Clan, a faction of the righteous path, and he was currently invested in plotting against the Lava Immortal Palace. Why would he give up his current good life and join the demonic path?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Well, strictly speaking, the Spaceless Sect was not a sect of the demonic path. However, it was definitely a heterodox faction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong shook his head as well. “Too bad, you’re an excellent prospect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This suddenly gave Ning Zhuo pause.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">In the Lava Immortal Palace, he had guessed that he might have a hidden innate talent, and that this innate talent was better than his Early Wisdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Thinking of this now, Ning Zhuo probed, “I heard that the Spaceless Sect likes recruiting cultivators with innate talents related to the hands. For example, the Snatching Fragrance Stealing Jade Hand, Void Dislocation Hand, Flowing Light Weaving Shadow Hand, Seven Skillful Hand, Cloud Piercing Hand, and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Boss Sun, do I have this kind of innate talent? Is that why you think so highly of me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong shook his head. “I’m not the guiding elder who brings people into the sect, how should I know?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“I just feel like you’re born to be a man of the demonic path.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo’s voice sank. “Don’t make such jokes in the future.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong glared and shouted, “You don’t believe me? You should know, my eyes are the best when it comes to judging people, I-”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Enough.” Ning Zhuo interrupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Sun Lingtong chuckled. “Fine, whatever. What should we do with these stolen pills?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo said, “My real goal was to capture Han Ming alive. These pills are too hot to handle, so let’s just throw them away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Sun Lie suffered Han Ming’s harassment for so long; I won’t believe it if you tell me he didn’t tamper with the pills somehow.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Sun Lingtong gave a thumbs up. “Brother, you’re still as cautious as ever. But isn’t it a pity to just get rid of them like this?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“With my Spaceless Sect’s methods, as long as you give me some time, even the most secretive tampering can be undone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"After all, Sun Lie is only at the peak of Foundation Establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo shook his head. “I don’t think you should do that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“We accidentally ran into Meng Chong this time. He’s the grandson of a Nascent Soul cultivator, and our actions might be interpreted as someone plotting against him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“By now, Fei Si has probably already started investigating us.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“There’s not enough time to check the pills. To be safe, you should deal with them right away!” Ning Zhuo said with emphasis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Sun Lingtong patted his chest and nodded. “You’re right, I still want to stay in this Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“But, how should we deal with these pills?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo snorted coldly. “Isn’t it simple? Just toss them into Fire Persimmon Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong was stunned, then his eyes lit up. He clapped his hands and spoke words of praise. “Great idea, amazing idea!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">After parting with Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo took his spoils and returned to the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">In a dark underground prison cell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A basin of cold water was splashed on Han Ming’s face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Han Ming’s head was lowered and her eyes were closed. She didn’t move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In the guise of Hanging-Hair Traveler, Ning Zhuo laughed mockingly in a hoarse voice. “Han Ming, stop faking it. You woke up five minutes ago.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Han Ming gritted her teeth and suddenly opened her eyes, not concealing her hatred and killing intent in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“How dare you turn on me?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“I am a disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect. If you want to kill me, think about the consequences first!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo sighed internally. All he wanted to do was work hard in secret and pursue the Lava Immortal Palace while hiding himself. Not once had he thought of offending any demonic sects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But he had no choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">In his current situation, he could only grit his teeth and move forward. If he took a step back – no, if he so much as slowed down – he would fall into an endless abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Even a rabbit forced into a corner will bite, let alone a person.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">However, there was no need to broadcast his internal helplessness to the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo looked at Han Ming and stared at her silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">His gaze struck terror into Han Ming’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Gradually, she misunderstood something, and her expression softened. She adopted a helpless and weak attitude, speaking with the tone of someone agreeing to a compromise for the sake of survival. “Alright, I admit defeat. As long as you let me go, I’ll do anything you ask.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
