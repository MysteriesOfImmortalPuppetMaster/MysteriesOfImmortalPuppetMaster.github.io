<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Green Stone Cave Residence</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo sat at the head of the table, raising his wine cup to the invited cultivators. "Our victory over Ban Ji was entirely due to our united efforts and unwavering cooperation. Come, let's raise another glass!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Upon returning from Green Bamboo Peak, Ning Zhuo had immediately invited the other eleven cultivators who had successfully passed the trials. Some Golden Core cultivators declined, either due to their upcoming competitive relationships or simply out of reluctance. In the end, only five accepted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo invited these five to his cave residence, where Old Chef prepared a lavish Spirit Food banquet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Spirit Valley Wine was rich and mellow, the Golden Thread Gill Fish crackled with savory aroma, and the braised Hundred Treasures Mushroom was so succulent it nearly made one's tongue fall off. Chilled Jade Marrow Fruit offered a refreshing sweetness with a unique, cooling flavor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"That Ban Ji may be from the Ban Clan, but his actions are no different from those of a Demonic Cultivator," a young cultivator remarked. "He'll snatch any exceptional mechanical construct he lays eyes on. I've despised him for ages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The speaker was a young cultivator with curly, yellowish hair and numerous burn scars and gunpowder stains on his face and hands. His nickname was Firecracker, and those close to him called him A'Huo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He favored crafting explosive mechanical constructs and harbored a deep hatred for evil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Hei Gezi Chen San chimed in, "Heh, I've heard some rumors. The cultivation art Ban Ji practices isn't the Ban Clan's standard technique. They say it's a demonic art!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo immediately nodded. "I know it. It's the Greedy Machine Demonic Heart Art. The art claims: 'Feed the demon with greed, and the demon's strength fuels the machine's ferocity; seize the machine to nourish greed, and the demon's frenzy intensifies.'</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"That's why Ban Ji's demonic thoughts are so troublesome. You all must have experienced that firsthand, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Wang Ai seized the opportunity, immediately sharing intelligence he had acquired at great expense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">His words resonated deeply with the group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Huo Cuoer burst into hearty laughter, nodding repeatedly. "Of course, of course! Ban Ji's divine sense is a nightmare to deal with!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Zhang Xiaodan's voice rumbled, "Indeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He was a stout man with broad shoulders and a thick waist, his skin gleaming like polished iron. His burly frame and somewhat wooden demeanor gave him an air of sturdiness, and his speech was gruff and mechanical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yet his divine sense was surprisingly "soft and pliable," proving to be the most stubborn and resilient among the many divine senses surrounding Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">As the conversation shifted to their common enemy and shared battle experiences, the atmosphere at the banquet grew colder and more intense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">One of the male cultivators turned to Zi Lei and asked directly how his feud with Ban Ji had begun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zi Lei glanced at you gratefully before offering a bitter smile. He sighed and said, "If I told you that today's Great Xingyun Tournament was the first time I've ever seen Ban Ji in person, would you all believe me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">With that, he retrieved a letter from his Storage Belt and passed it around for everyone to examine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The letter was naturally the one Ban Ji had sent earlier, proposing a friendly exchange of techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">As the others read, Zi Lei continued, "However, I do have some theories and evidence regarding my conflict with Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"I sent a subordinate to personally deliver my reply to Ban Ji. At the time, he was drinking and laughing with Pi Fujie...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"And Pi Fujie and I happen to have a history of conflict."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zi Lei had been invited by Wang Ai, but the Shen Clan of Four Palaces Immortal City and the Pi Family were sworn enemies. Consequently, Pi Fujie harbored hatred for Zi Lei as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">When Pi Fujie provoked him, Zi Lei refused to back down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"In the end, I directly killed one of my newly recruited Demon Cultivator subordinates."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Please observe," Zi Lei said, retrieving the tiger pelt and deliberately pointing out the locations of the Thousand-Layer Scale Talisman and the Bloodstained Surge Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Before this explanation, the crowd's perception of Zi Lei had subtly shifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"I never imagined Zi Lei would be associated with Ning Zhuo, Lin Jinglong, and Situ Xing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">While they knew little about Zi Lei himself, they had heard rumors about Wang Ai and the other seven. Since Wang Ai could associate with them, Zi Lei's reputation immediately rose to their level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"If that Tiger Demon was so powerful in life, and possessed two major demonic talismans, yet Zi Lei still managed to kill it..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Da Shan may have lacked strong divine sense, but his combat prowess was undeniable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"His mechanical constructs can kill Tiger Demons and withstand Banji Kai Gang's attacks - they must be extraordinary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"What kind of backing does he have? His connections must run deep!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Patch Sun glanced at Zi Lei, his expression worried. "The Pi Family started as a group of true Demonic Cultivators. They only switched to the Righteous Path after bribing high-ranking officials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"The Pi Family's reputation is spotless!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Young Master Ning, you must be extremely cautious in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Patchy Sun” was Ning Zhuo's nickname. He was an old man with a huge axe strapped to his back, deep wrinkles like furrows on his face, always looking worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He wore a faded, patched coarse shirt and carried a patched basket larger than himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">At the banquet, that basket sat in a corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhang Xiaodan sighed, "The Ban Clan is the most renowned family of mechanists in our nation. Who would have thought that their current generation would produce a heretic like Ban Ji?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As he spoke, Ning Zhuo sensed a hint of pity in his tone toward the Ban Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The young female cultivator Jiang Dabian snorted coldly. "Pi Fudong and Ban Ji - they're clearly no good. Birds of a feather flock together!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zi Lei nodded inwardly, adding silently, "Exactly. That's precisely the case."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">By this point, Ning Zhuo had already achieved more than half of his purpose in hosting this banquet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In Zi Lei's eyes, Ban Ji had one fatal weakness: he was a Demonic Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">As a Demonic Cultivator, his reputation would inevitably be tarnished, making him an easy target for encirclement and attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">In comparison, Zi Lei, though lacking a renowned reputation, was at least not entirely negative like Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Thus, during Qingfuzi's first Great Xingyun Tournament, Zi Lei exploited this advantage to successfully divide a small group of cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ban Ji's own frenzied and aggressive fighting style further aided Zi Lei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">After all, most people knew Ban Ji and harbored a deep-seated fear of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">As for whether ganging up on him was unfair?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Of course not! What fairness could one expect when dealing with a Demonic Cultivator? Everyone just had to band together!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Through his subsequent speeches, Zi Lei repeatedly reinforced this narrative: Ban Ji was a Demonic Cultivator, while Zi Lei represented the Righteous Path. "They are the villains," he declared, "and uniting against Ban Ji is a righteous act!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">To support his claims, Zi Lei presented numerous pieces of evidence, convincing the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Bai Kuizi Chen Ba turned to Wang Ai. "Young Master Ning, you must be extra cautious. Are you accompanied by any elders from your family?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Whether it's Pi Fujie or Ban Ji's clan, their influence extends far and wide across our nation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Chen Ba was lean and wiry, with pale skin and sharp eyes that held a hint of shrewdness and wariness. Under the guise of concern, he was actually probing Zi Lei's background.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">In this world, connections and backing matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zi Lei smiled faintly. "To be honest, this is my first time at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main gate. I'm new here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"I believe in treating others with kindness and never intended to offend anyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"But let's be clear: offending villains like Pi Fudong and Ban Ji is no loss at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"My elder, Jian, didn't scold me. He simply warned me to be more cautious!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Zi Lei didn't reveal any explicit information, but the eyes of the others flickered subtly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The fact that Zi Lei's elders maintained such a firm stance against the Pi and Ban Clans hinted at Wang Ai's formidable backing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Changing his tone to a more conciliatory one, Zi Lei said, "Once the Flying Cloud Grand Assembly concludes, you'll officially become members of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"If Ban Ji and Pi Fudong also succeed in joining, we'll be fellow sect members. Any conflicts between us can then be resolved fairly through the Martial Arts Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Knowing we're all members of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, we'll have even less reason to fear them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zi Lei's optimistic outlook and forward-thinking approach immediately resonated with the group, successfully shifting the conversation to a more positive direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">These seven cultivators had come to the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main gate with the intention of joining the sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">According to Zi Lei's recent conversation with them, all seven of were rogue cultivators, each specializing in different aspects of Mechanism arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">For instance, Patch Sun excelled at repairs and modifications, while Zhang Xiaodan was a master artificer, specializing in heavy mechanisms. Huo Ba'er, on the other hand, had extensive experience with explosive mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect? It's both difficult and not difficult!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"If you were to inherit Qingjiuzi's legacy, would that guarantee your admission to the Myriad Manifestations Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Absolutely not. Haven't you heard? Qingjiuzi's legacy even includes the Peak Lord's Token for Green Bamboo Peak!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Since they all shared the same goal, the conversation flowed freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zi Lei listened for a while, frequently interjecting with his own thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Someone brought up the Primer of Primordial Sounds, and the discussion shifted to the punishment for the Great Qinghuangzi Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Including Zi Lei, there were seventeen victors in total, each awarded a copy of the Primer of Primordial Sounds and the Tooth Tablet Book.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Zhang Xiaodan expressed his concern: "I know nothing about music theory. I'm afraid I'll fare poorly in the subsequent trials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Huo Cuoer raised an eyebrow. "What's there to fear? At worst, you'll just lose a round."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Chen Bazhe turned to Jiang Dabian, a male cultivator. "You think Fellow Daoist Jiang has the least chance?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Jiang Dabian, a young-looking cultivator with a long braid, had a sallow complexion and thin frame. His hair was dry and yellow, always tied into a small bun at the front of his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Several bamboo slips hung from his waist, often emitting the chirping of insects that had been kept in cold windows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Jiang Dabian specialized in crafting intricate insect-based mechanisms using Spirit Insects as his primary material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">During battles, he would open his bamboo slips and release swarms of Mechanical Great Insects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Since the number of insects was limited, he couldn't control them individually with strands of spiritual energy. Instead, he played an insect flute, using its sound to command the various Mechanical Great Insects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Music played a crucial role in Qing Huangzi's mechanical arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Book of Primal Resonance Reeds was a classic text on mechanism crafting, detailing the creation of mechanical components. It described seventy different types of reeds, each capable of producing a unique primordial sound. Conversely, cultivators could emit these primordial sounds to resonate with specific reeds, thereby manipulating mechanical constructs from the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Jiang Dabian: "Speaking of which, I've already skimmed through the Primer of Primordial Sounds."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"There's a passage that caught my attention: 'West Mountain Refined Copper forged into clear-sounding teeth, their hidden arrangement echoing through the empty valleys. Bathed in the Heavenly Rain of the Seven-Four period, when the rain forms rainbows, the teeth become as clear as ice.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Crystal. Place it at the navel, drawing in wind and harmonizing Qi. When vibrated, it purifies the four corners of the world." How do you interpret this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The group's discussion immediately focused on that passage, each member offering their own interpretation, which only deepened the confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Zi Lei participated throughout, a smile playing on his lips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Though he didn't gain any deeper understanding, he deliberately concealed his ignorance in this setting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">It was crucial to showcase his strengths. Ban Ji hadn't been eliminated yet, and in the upcoming Great Xingyun Tournament hosted by Qing Huangzi, Zi Lei's true opponents weren't the other eleven participants, but rather the seven present in the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Despite his young age, Zi Lei was remarkably mature, showing no trace of youthful arrogance or the need to flaunt his intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">After a brief exchange of conflicting opinions, the group began to argue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zi Lei immediately intervened, restoring order: "Fellow cultivators, allow me to offer a suggestion. Shall we temporarily set aside our discussion of the Primordial Sound Tooth Tablet Book? We can each face the upcoming Great Qingjiuzi Trial according to our own interpretations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"And let's make one thing clear: whoever ultimately inherits the legacy of the Grand Envoy must treat us all to a feast!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"We're not like Ban Ji and his ilk. Our meeting here is a matter of fate, wouldn't you agree?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Wang Ai, as the host and a figure of considerable status, proposed the toast, which was immediately met with unanimous approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Zhang Xiaodan hadn't anticipated being the first to leave. "Even if you only obtain that one classic text, it would still be a significant achievement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Patch Sun reassured Zhang Xiaodan, "In fact, Senior Qingjiuzi was also a rogue cultivator, just like us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"While my mastery of mechanisms is unique, it's still not quite first-rate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"That's right," Chen Ba nodded. "Within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, there's an extremely prestigious family of mechanists. It's the Meng Clan of Shen Tai Peak!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Zi Lei's heart stirred slightly at this mention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">This wasn't the first time he'd heard of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Zi Lei had learned about the Meng Clan from Song Fuli.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">When Zi Lei arrived at the Myriad Manifestations Sect and gathered intelligence, he also found information related to the Meng Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Although my mother's surname is Meng, she has no connection to that Meng Clan," Zi Lei said. "If there were any relation, she would have told me long ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Still, this is for the best," Chen Ba continued. "Shen Chou Peak is extremely powerful. If you were entangled in their affairs through family ties, you'd likely be trapped in the sect's deepest and most treacherous internal power struggles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Who knows? You might die without even realizing how!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Chen Ba added, "The Meng Clan cultivators of Shen Tai Peak are hosting the Great Xingyun Tournament. I'll break my head trying to participate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"It's a pity the Meng Clan has kept such a low profile these past years, showing little outward activity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"They'll likely maintain their secretive stance at this upcoming Great Cloud Gathering."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The banquet concluded with mutual satisfaction, the guests and hosts parting with lingering reluctance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Wang Ai retreated to solitude, retrieving the Jade Slip containing The Book of Primal Resonance Reeds to study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Reflecting on the conversations and introductions he had heard, he inwardly assessed:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Patch Sun is trapped by 'form,' seeking its 'function.' Chen Ba excels at 'transformation,' neglecting 'purity.' Zhang Xiaodan clings to 'orthodoxy,' fixating on 'structure.' Jiang Dabian grasps 'life,' yet remains bewildered by 'spirit.' Firecracker sees only 'application,' blind to its 'mystery.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"In truth, the poetic metaphors of 'Heavenly Rain,' 'Seven-Four,' and 'Ice Crystal Clarity' offer threefold guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"First, they distinguish between clarity and turbidity: Heavenly Rain need not be outwardly manifest; its essence lies in perfect purity. Second, they reveal the laws of the cosmos: Seven-Four is not a fixed number, but the cyclical rhythm of pure sound's emergence. Third, they illuminate the pinnacle of spiritual nature: Ice Crystal Clarity does not describe mere appearance, but evokes a sound like cold springs cleansing the soul..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">For Wang Ai, this classic text was straightforward and easily understood. After reading it through several times, he had no further doubts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">To be on the safe side, I used the Intentional Brush, drawing upon the Luoshu pages, to "see" it all again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">This time, I gained no unexpected new insights.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
