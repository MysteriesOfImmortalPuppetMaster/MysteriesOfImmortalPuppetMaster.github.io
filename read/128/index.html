<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Three-year-old Ning Zhuo moved out a small furnace and refined a new material for Sun Lingtong on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Sun Lingtong sneered, "I don't even need a pill furnace, just watch." He extended his hand, igniting a flame from his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He successively threw medicinal herbs into the fire, quickly obtaining a brand-new material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"How about it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">After inspecting, Ning Zhuo clapped repeatedly, "Brother Sun, you're amazing! You don't need a pill furnace and can do it barehanded. You did it faster and better than me!" Sun Lingtong shook his head, "This is nothing, you must stay humble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo nodded heavily in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Four-year-old Ning Zhuo held a talisman brush, drawing runes on talisman paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">It came naturally, succeeding in one go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lingtong was slightly surprised, knowing he had to be faster and make better runes than Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He appeared nonchalant, deliberately yawning, his eyelids drooping, casually holding the brush, but in reality, he was fully focused, completing it in one breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After comparing, Ning Zhuo gave a heartfelt thumbs up, "Brother Sun, you're awesome! Compared to you, I'm really not good. You're truly incredible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Sun Lingtong sighed, "There are countless geniuses, compared to them, I'm as insignificant as an ant. Little Zhuo, you must stay humble." Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly, "I know, I'll remember!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Five-year-old Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and began setting up a formation on a blank formation disk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Three hours later, he wiped the sweat off his forehead, somewhat embarrassed, "Brother Sun, I failed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong witnessed the entire process, feeling a deep admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo gave his all, and although he failed, his formation skills far exceeded the standard for his age!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong appeared calm, "Not bad, now watch me." He quickly set up the formation, completing it in just one hour.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo inspected the formation disk, utterly convinced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sun Lingtong wiped the sweat from his forehead, thinking, "Formations aren't my strong suit, luckily I tampered with the formation disk last night." He said to Ning Zhuo, "This is nothing, there's still much room for improvement." Ning Zhuo strongly agreed, quickly pointing out many flaws in the formation disk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In the end, he proactively told Sun Lingtong, "Brother Sun, I will continue to work hard, don't worry, I won't be complacent or arrogant!" "That's good, that's good," Sun Lingtong nodded, filled with gratification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Inwardly, he felt deeply uneasy: "He's only five years old, what will I do next year?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After this incident, he decided to secretly carve out time to meticulously study the myriad arts of cultivation to better handle the increasingly formidable Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The content of the competition at six years old was beast taming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo was full of fighting spirit and confidence: "Brother Sun, my Fiery Majestic General is very strong. At the beginning of the school year, I personally hatched it and have been nurturing it since it was young. For this school exam, I sealed more than half of its power in advance, and it still easily made it to the fifth place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong nodded, expressionless: "It seems your fighting rooster is indeed formidable. Mine is not as good, I've only had it for a little over a month." He secretly chuckled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">In reality, more than a year ago, he realized he couldn't suppress Ning Zhuo anymore, so he specifically investigated the exam topics of previous years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He also inquired in advance and confirmed this year's exam content.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Therefore, he had been secretly training his fighting rooster for far longer than Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo released his Fiery Majestic General, while Sun Lingtong released his Little Blackie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The General launched the first attack, spreading its wings like blades, swooping towards its opponent with a whistling wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Little Blackie nimbly dodged and quickly counterattacked, using its sharp beak and claws to strike at the opponent's chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The two roosters fought fiercely, the battle growing more intense, feathers flying and blood splattering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo gave it his all, occasionally casting spells to protect his Fiery Majestic General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But in the end, the General's full-force strike was dodged by Little Blackie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The latter leaped into the air, tearing the General's comb, securing the victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The General fell to the ground, barely breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Little Blackie also staggered, having fought to its limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo panted heavily, his face flushed, filled with disappointment, his eyes dull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He paused, then hurriedly ran to the field, placing his hands on the General, activating healing spells to treat it with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The General's injuries quickly stabilized, its breathing became steady, and it fell into a deep sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">After a while, Ning Zhuo finally looked up, his voice low: "Brother Sun, I lost again." He couldn't hide his dejection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong's tense mood gradually eased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He originally thought he had a significant advantage, but he didn't expect this roosterfight to be so closely matched, with the outcome only decided at the last moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He knew his victory was not honorable, having secretly invested much more into Little Blackie than Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Lingtong felt guilty and sincerely praised: "You performed very well. If you had gone all out, your General would definitely be the top of the school."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo shook his head: "What's the point of being the top of the school? Compared to the entire Fire Persimmon City, I'm nothing. In the whole Southern Bean Country, I don't even rank. Not to mention, there are other cultivation nations. I've always been inferior to Brother Sun, I always lose..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth, trying to console him: "I almost lost just now." "Really."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"You used a mechanism technique in your final move, didn't you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo nodded, "Yes, I usually use the Puppet String Technique to train General. Later, I referenced some cultivation techniques and designed a few commands. As long as I say them, General will soar down and strike the enemy. At the same time, it will activate the talismans hidden deep within General's feathers, greatly enhancing his attack power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sun Lingtong was momentarily stunned and sincerely praised, "Incredible! You've already started using various methods to train your fighting rooster. You haven't confined yourself to the teachings of the academy elders. You're innovating, and most importantly, the practical results are excellent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo remained humble, "Brother Sun, thank you for your praise, but please don't comfort me. I understand! I still need to work harder. This battle exposed many of my shortcomings. I really am nothing compared to you all. I must work even harder to make up for my lack of talent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Sun Lingtong fell silent, pondering whether he had been too harsh over the years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The competition at the age of seven had made Sun Lingtong furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Little Zhuo, what's going on? Over the past year, although you've made some progress in the myriad arts of cultivation, it's not much. What have you been doing? Have you been studying seriously?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo lowered his head, admitting his mistake, and told Sun Lingtong that he and his classmates had been indulging in pellet games.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Sun Lingtong inquired carefully about what pellet games were and found the content dull and tasteless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He was heartbroken, "You actually got addicted to this, it's simply a waste of time!" He sternly reprimanded Ning Zhuo for a full incense stick's time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo, with tears in his eyes, said, "Brother Sun, I won't do it again. I will study hard! I know I'm very lacking and have many shortcomings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Hearing this, Sun Lingtong was taken aback and couldn't help but think: Have I been suppressing Ning Zhuo's achievements too much, distorting his perception, making him lack a sense of accomplishment and confidence, thereby losing the motivation for self-improvement?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Actually..." Sun Lingtong adjusted his tone, "Little Zhuo, you've already done very well before. Don't belittle yourself too much." Ning Zhuo replied, "I know, Brother Sun. You don't have to comfort me! I understand." Sun Lingtong: "..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">In the Kindness Garden, Li Leifeng was holding a puppet show.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong sneaked in, stealing the cultivators' personal belongings to use as resources for his daily cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After Li Leifeng's performance ended, he went to the private room to thank the Zhou family elder for his generous donation during the show.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The elder of the Jian family also wanted to befriend Li Leifeng and asked about his methods of teaching children during their conversation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Under your guidance, Elder Li, the orphans in the Kindness Garden are all well-behaved, sensible, and hardworking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Sigh, my son Zhou Zeshen is so mischievous and hates school. He has no interest in learning at all. It's really giving me a headache!" Li Leifeng inquired a few questions, learned the truth, and smiled, "Old Xi's suggestion is to let him play."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The elder of the Jian family was puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Li Leifeng then said, "From your description, I understand that your esteemed son is actually under strict supervision. Besides attending classes at school, he has numerous extra lessons at home and very little time for himself to play. It's precisely because he plays too little that even a blade of grass, a pen, or a cloud in the sky can captivate him, making him daydream and get distracted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"You must know: no matter how smart a child is, they all have a child's heart. Playing is their nature and an essential part of their growth. Only by playing continuously can they find joy and happiness. When they play enough, a blade of grass or a pen will no longer tempt them. This is exactly what they need for their growth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sun Lingtong, who was hiding nearby, listened intently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">From then on, he never stole money from the Ci You Yuan again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong excitedly found Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"You've really hit the jackpot running into me, kid." His abrupt words left Ning Zhuo feeling bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Come on, I'll take you out to play!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Six-year-old Ning Zhuo was incredulous, his eyes filled with joy, "Really, really?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Of course!" Sun Lingtong raised his head, grabbed Ning Zhuo's arm, and traversed the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">In a dark alley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun Lingtong "encouraged" Ning Zhuo, "See that unpleasant guy? Just use the method I just taught you and steal something for fun!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo hesitated, "Isn't it bad to steal people's things?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"What are you afraid of? Listen to your Brother Sun, I won't harm you." Sun Lingtong patted his chest and kept urging, "It's very thrilling, especially the first time, it will make you feel very excited!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Under his guidance, Ning Zhuo chose a local ruffian and stole his money pouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The ruffian frantically searched, almost stripping himself naked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo hid in the dark, laughing heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Before leaving, he even seemed to throw the money pouch back at the ruffian's feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder, "How was it? Feels thrilling, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Yeah! It was quite fun," Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Lingtong sighed, "Sometimes, when I'm in a bad mood, I wander around the streets. If I see someone unpleasant, I steal their things. Hahaha, every time I steal, I feel much better!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo hesitated, "Brother Sun, it's better not to do this. The school teaches us to walk the right path and do the right things. Stealing is not a good behavior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes and then smiled slyly, "What the school elders say makes sense. What I'm teaching you is actually the same thing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo stared, expressing confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong said, "Don't you understand the principle of punishing evil and promoting good? Punishing these evil people is accumulating good deeds, it's an act of justice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"The ruffian you just taught a lesson to usually bullies the honest and kind-hearted poor. In the end, you only gave him a scare without causing any real loss. You really let him off easy!" Ning Zhuo squinted his eyes, "Then I'll go back and steal from him again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Sun Lingtong nodded, "Alright, I'll go with you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"This time, I'll teach you a new method of stealing. Try it out; it feels different from the previous one."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
