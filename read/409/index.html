<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 409: Does Ning Zhuo Have a Royal Mandate?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji didn't say much, but Ning Zhuo understood that the Southern Bean Kingdom was also involved in Two Notes Kingdom, placing heavy bets on Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo pondered silently: "The implication is that he wants me to assist Thousand Peaks Forest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"But the Six Caves Sect is a faction within Thousand Peaks Forest's territory, perhaps they've also received secret support from the Southern Bean royal family?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">His family elder, Ning Jiufan, had instructed him to teach the Six Caves Sect a lesson if the situation called for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Yet Zhu Xuanji was subtly suggesting that Ning Zhuo should assist the forces within Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The conflicting wishes made Ning Zhuo feel somewhat troubled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After some thought, Ning Zhuo nodded to Zhu Xuanji, indicating that he would act according to the situation and help if possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo then asked Zhu Xuanji for assistance in obtaining the Millennium Fire Essence for the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Great Detective, the Millennium Fire Essence is of great significance to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"The Mechanical Wandering Dragon consumes considerable spiritual power and requires Nascent Soul to operate. If I had the Millennium Fire Essence, it could greatly alleviate this predicament."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Zhu Xuanji directly shook his head, indicating he couldn't help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"During the previous negotiation at the Linglong Mirror Wall, Elder Shen clearly stated that the royal family cannot interfere arbitrarily in Fire Persimmon Immortal City's internal affairs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"After all, Meng Ying is the current city lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Unless there's a valid prior reason, arbitrary interference in city matters would be equivalent to our royal Zhu family encroaching on the Meng family's interests. This would greatly damage the tacit understanding within our court, cause our royal family to lose popular support, and arouse the vigilance of other senior officials, potentially leading to collective opposition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Although such losses were intangible, anyone with even slight political acumen would understand their enormous magnitude!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It was like how Linghu Jiu was willing to compensate Ning Zhuo with the Judicial Maps of Fire and Metal Elements to salvage Myriad Medicine Sect's reputation and prestige.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Such reputation and prestige, though seemingly insubstantial, actually influence people's hearts and affect the choices of many talented individuals and forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">When these choices accumulate, they form a tremendous momentum that has an impact beyond ordinary imagination on the main body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"It's precisely because of this that our Zhu family strongly supports your Ning family and the Zhou family," Zhu Xuanji shook his head, indicating that the royal family would absolutely not interfere arbitrarily in this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The royal family's concerns were also reflected in this multi-party cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">On the surface, the alliance only involved the Ning family and Myriad Medicine Sect, with no apparent involvement of the royal family. In reality, the Zhu family played an extremely important key role, providing guarantees to the Ning family and Myriad Medicine Sect, as well as the strongest external supervision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It must be said that Ning Zhuo's introduction of the Zhu family's power was an extremely clever move!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Seeing that his final effort had failed, Ning Zhuo turned to make another request: "Regarding the Millennium Fire Essence, it would be best to obtain it from Fire Persimmon Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"If that's not possible, could I purchase it from the royal family?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zhu Xuanji chuckled and pointed at Ning Zhuo: "You rascal, this was your real request all along, wasn't it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Having spent time with Ning Zhuo, he had figured out many of his social tactics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly: "Indeed, we do have Millennium Fire Essence in our royal treasury. However, the spirituality of these fire essences is far inferior to the one in Fire Persimmon Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Everyone had seen the relevant intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhu Xuanji: "You, who possess the Fire Luminescence Prajna Spirit-Understanding Scripture, know better than anyone how important spirituality is."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Millennium Fire Essence with insufficient spirituality takes a much longer time to self-absorb and recover."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Therefore, your best option is still to capture the one in the mountain. Since you have the Ten Thousand Li Wandering Dragon, why not return to your family at the crucial moment and lend a hand?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Regarding this question, Ning Zhuo had actually already considered it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He firmly shook his head: "Great Detective, you also know the true purpose of my world travels."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"It's to replenish the spirituality for my mother's mechanism, for healing purposes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The Millennium Fire Essence isn't essential for me. The urgent priority is to do everything possible to quickly replenish my mother's spirituality."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Other matters must be arranged later."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zhu Xuanji nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Back then, in the Magma Immortal Palace, he had used his Golden Eyes along with the Root-Tracing Decision to see two instances of Meng Yaoyin using the Golden Furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">At the final moment of the struggle for the Magma Immortal Palace, he was present and personally witnessed how the Buddhist Heart Demon Seal "actively" embraced Ning Zhuo, how Ning Zhuo burned the throne to replenish his mother's spirituality, and finally Ning Zhuo's clever move - inviting Meng Yan to be the city lord!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">It could be said that he knew more of Ning Zhuo's secrets than anyone, even more than Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly: "So, you plan to burn the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo nodded, frankly admitting it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">This was something easily deducible for someone of the Great Detective's capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">After all, Ning Zhuo's previous use of the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat for embryo nurturing could be found in Myriad Medicine Sect's sect records.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat was a sect's inherited treasure, benefiting all members. Its applications would all be carefully planned and recorded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Zhu Xuanji had already suspected Ning Zhuo's intentions when he proposed borrowing the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat in the alliance. For this reason, he had secretly helped Ning Zhuo during the specifics of the alliance treaty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Lin Bufan had wanted to add some clauses to ensure the safety of inherited treasures like the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, prohibiting intentional damage, and including punishments for loss or damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">These clauses were all blocked by Zhu Xuanji, who said at the time that mere treasures like the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat and Spirit-Concealing Willow, though important for power management, were insignificant compared to the Linglong Mirror Wall. He believed everyone would cherish them and not deliberately damage them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He also said: These restrictive and punitive clauses, when designed, wouldn't provide much protection. Instead, if one day things went wrong and enemies destroyed the inherited treasures, these punitive clauses would cause hidden conflicts within the alliance and internal contradictions, so it was better not to design them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Lin Bufan had no idea that Ning Zhuo was "outwardly crazy," having coveted the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat long before coming to Myriad Medicine Sect, planning to burn it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Lin Bufan didn't know about Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's injuries, nor did he know that Ning Zhuo possessed the Fire Luminescence Prajna Spirit-Understanding Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Since Zhu Xuanji spoke this way, he thought deeply at the time and felt that Zhu Xuanji, being worthy of his position as Great Detective and important member of the Souhtern Bean royal family, had great vision and made very reasonable points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Lin Bufan thus agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Therefore, when Ning Zhuo would later cremate the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, there would be no alliance restrictions, giving him great convenience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo was a clever child, and Zhu Xuanji's help at that time made him realize that Zhu Xuanji had secretly assisted him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">At this moment, Ning Zhuo bowed deeply to Zhu Xuanji: "Thank you, Great Detective, for your concern and secret assistance. I am deeply grateful and will certainly remember this kindness and repay it in the future!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">However, Zhu Xuanji stepped aside to avoid the bow: "Don't keep bowing, and don't keep making promises. Don't you know these things affect destiny?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"We talk about oral seals, mind seals, and body seals helping with spellcasting, but their inner meaning is much more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Everything we say is an oral seal. Every decision and thought we make is a mind seal. Every actual action we take is a body seal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"These seals leave their mark, affecting us and changing our fate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"I won't accept your bow, and you don't need to repay me. I just saw how hard you're working, shouldering alone the heavy responsibility of saving your mother, and I understand your inner urgency and torment. Such pure filial piety naturally inspires others to help."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"However, although your combat power is remarkable, and your Five Elements realm is now profound, beyond my reach, this path forward may not have ideal results."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Have you considered this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo fell into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Of course he had thought about this question, but he couldn't accept the consequences of failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Seeing the big-headed youth before him fall silent, Zhu Xuanji frowned slightly: "In this world, eight or nine out of ten things don't go as wished. If it weren't so, 'may everything go as you wish' wouldn't be a blessing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth: "I only know that I will give it my all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhu Xuanji sighed and waved his hand, only saying: "Set off then."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo bowed to Zhu Xuanji in thanks, stepped forward, entered the Ten Thousand Li Wandering Dragon, and left Medicine Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">As if sensing something, Linghu Jiu, who was fighting in the Linglong Mirror Wall, momentarily hesitated and was immediately pressed into a disadvantage by the monster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">In the chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Xiaoju watched Lin Shanshan pacing in the room: "Young Miss, Young Master Ning Zhuo is about to set off. Are you really not going to see him off?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Lin Shanshan, who had been hesitating, became resolute after this prompting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Forget it, I won't go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">She sat at the round table, staring intently at the mist orchid in the vase on the table, murmuring: "Everything that needed to be said was already said at the farewell banquet. It's not like I'll never see him again?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"This silly big head is so capable, he could even kidnap me, and has talent surpassing Senior Brother's. His reputation will surely grow greater and greater in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Plus with the cooperation between our Myriad Medicine Sect and the Ning family, and his promise to write to me, it's fine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">These words seemed to be directed at Xiaoju, but were actually Lin Shanshan convincing herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Young Miss..." Xiaoju looked worriedly at Lin Shanshan but didn't press further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">On the mountain peak, watching the Ten Thousand Li Wandering Dragon disappear, the golden light in Zhu Xuanji's eyes slowly dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Shen Lingshu approached, seemingly unhurried but actually quick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zhu Xuanji glanced at Shen Lingshu: "Elder, I now finally understand why our lord wanted me to maintain constant contact with Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"This destiny-bearing child is extraordinary!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"The abundance of his destiny numbers and the mysteriousness of his opportunities are beyond prediction. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe his Five Elements realm had far surpassed mine, and that he had made such progress in Five Elements sorcery."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Our mighty Zhu family, ruling a country, has also benefited because of him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"The Linglong Mirror Wall... such a quasi-immortal tool, how many practical talents it can cultivate for our Zhu family!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Zhu Xuanji had previously wanted to stay far away from Ning Zhuo, the farther the better, but after this incident, he found it was actually quite good!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Zhu Xuanji then asked: "Elder, how were the calculations this time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Is Ning Zhuo's immortal talent truly a royal mandate?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Or has he mastered the divine ability of Life Hanging by a Thread?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Southern Bean royal family sent Shen Lingshu over not just to support Zhu Xuanji. He actually carried a more important mission from the Southern Bean lord - to investigate Ning Zhuo and thoroughly check his background!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Royal mandates are classified into different categories, each different. But regardless of type, they are all supreme talents, namely immortal talents!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">As for major secrets like the divine ability of Life Hanging by a Thread, Shen Lingshu, as a member of the royal family, was also informed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">If Ning Zhuo had a royal mandate, then the Souhtern Bean's Zhu family would need to be fully on guard and find ways to expel the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Yet on this point, the Five Elements Divine Lord was extremely reticent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">If there was the divine ability of Life Hanging by a Thread, the royal family's reaction would be even more intense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">It could be said that the Southern Bean royal family's true attitude toward Ning Zhuo would depend on Shen Lingshu's investigation results.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
