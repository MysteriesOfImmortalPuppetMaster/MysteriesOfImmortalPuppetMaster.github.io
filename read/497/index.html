<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
A squad of cultivators was climbing to the mountain summit.<br/>
<br/>
At the head was the Golden Core cultivator, Gao Cuo. He could not help but look back once more, gazing toward Bikun Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
His deputy said admiringly, “Master Gao, this is already the ninth time you’ve looked back at Bikun Mountain since we withdrew.”<br/>
<br/>
“This shows just how deep your feelings for Bikun Mountain truly run!”<br/>
<br/>
“You only took over here half a year ago, yet you’re so attached. Previously, when news arrived that a massive enemy army was bearing down, you were also the first to advocate holding our ground.”<br/>
<br/>
“Your courage, your sense of responsibility —both are abundantly clear. Alas, it is we who were blind and failed to see your worth. Since you took over, we’ve often paid you lip service while secretly disobeying —truly, we shouldn’t have!”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo glanced at his deputy and sighed. “Bikun Mountain has been abandoned. I believe this is a grave error made by those above!”<br/>
<br/>
“Unfortunately, though I am Golden Core level, I’m not among the upper ranks of Thousand Peaks Forest. My hands are tied.”<br/>
<br/>
The deputy hesitated briefly but spoke anyway: “Master Gao, according to orders from above, we were supposed to destroy all the crystals under the lake before we left.”<br/>
<br/>
“But in actual fact, you did not do so.”<br/>
<br/>
“If the lake-bottom crystals benefit the enemy, that’s considered a serious offense.”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo shook his head. “Don’t worry about that.”<br/>
<br/>
“Before I took over, the previous mountain lord had already carried away any empty crystals that could be mined.”<br/>
<br/>
“What remains now hasn’t taken form. If you dig them out directly, these unformed empty crystals would instantly dissipate.”<br/>
<br/>
“You all personally witnessed it before we left, did you not?”<br/>
<br/>
The deputy and the others were persuaded by these words and nodded repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo stared at the Bikun Mountain summit, while inwardly asking, “Sword Elder, do you think our disguise will be detected?”<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, a sharp, hoary voice sounded within his mind: “Rest assured. The spell I taught you is extremely versatile.”<br/>
<br/>
“Unless you run into the rare few who have extraordinary gifts or divine abilities, normal detection spells have almost no chance of breaking it.”<br/>
<br/>
That old voice paused, then continued: “Even if someone does see through it, very few people can pierce the barrier of the void. It’s far too difficult to excavate what’s inside!”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo nodded. “That’s good.”<br/>
<br/>
“After all, that empty crystal deposit isn’t ordinary —it’s hiding an Evil God Bone, deeply concealed, so even the last mountain lord didn’t notice it.”<br/>
<br/>
“If not for your reminder, Sword Elder, I would have missed it.”<br/>
<br/>
“When this war quiets down, we’ll move to retrieve it.”<br/>
<br/>
Sword Elder agreed: “That’s right. This Evil God Bone itself is at the Nascent Soul level —an extremely rare precious material. Its marrow is even at the Soul Formation level, containing the logic of the void.”<br/>
<br/>
“When you craft your life-bound flying sword in the future, if you refine this bone marrow into it, even at merely Golden Core level, you can temporarily traverse the void in bodily form through man-and-sword-as-one.”<br/>
<br/>
“That’s something most Nascent Soul cultivators can’t even manage!”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo sighed inwardly once more. “Sigh! It’s all because of that Du Tiechuan —of all the places he could attack, he just had to send his army here.”<br/>
<br/>
“And blame falls on the alliance of Thousand Peaks Forest for ordering the retreat.”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo shook his head helplessly, then turned around and continued forward.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, a brilliant, translucent beam of starlight, like a single thin thread, descended from the heavens and struck precisely at the summit of Bikun Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo’s expression changed drastically. “That place is Bikun Pool!”<br/>
<br/>
“An attack of this magnitude… it’s already reached the Soul Formation level.”<br/>
<br/>
“What in the world is going on?”<br/>
<br/>
“What happened over at Bikun Pool?!”<br/>
<br/>
All at once, Gao Cuo felt something ominous in his heart, like he had lost a treasure that was crucial to his entire life.<br/>
<br/>
One stick of incense earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Ning had arrived at Bikun Pool.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo only saw fragments of empty crystals at the bottom of the lake, but Sun Lingtong discovered a rare formed section.<br/>
<br/>
Even with guidance, Ning Zhuo was unable to see it.<br/>
<br/>
He tried various detection methods, but none worked.<br/>
<br/>
“How strange. Even though it’s right in front of me, I still can’t sense it,” Ning Zhuo sighed. “Boss, it looks like this thing is destined for you.”<br/>
<br/>
“Is that so?” Sun Lingtong propped his head on one hand and giggled.<br/>
<br/>
“These spiritual eyes of mine are best at spotting treasure.”<br/>
<br/>
“Since you can’t see it, let me do the digging.”<br/>
<br/>
But no matter how Sun Lingtong tried —using all sorts of spells, magical tools, etc. —once they touched the surface of the formed empty crystal, it was as though they passed through air, bypassing it entirely.<br/>
<br/>
It was as though that formed empty crystal was merely an illusory dream.<br/>
<br/>
“How bizarre!” Sun Lingtong was thoroughly baffled. “Even my Thieving Technique is useless. This formed empty crystal is out of the ordinary. There’s definitely something profound inside. Even my spiritual eyes can’t see any clue.”<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong ruffled his own hair.<br/>
<br/>
For him, this was an unbearable feeling!<br/>
<br/>
Treasure right before his eyes, but no way to get it with his current methods.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, who was effectively blind to it, tried as well but achieved nothing.<br/>
<br/>
“Then let’s pull out. We gain nothing by staying. After all, this is enemy territory,” Ning Zhuo said calmly.<br/>
<br/>
He urged Sun Lingtong: “Boss, since we already know this place exists, let’s come back when we’re stronger.”<br/>
<br/>
“All the other formed empty crystals have been taken away, and only you’ve discovered this secret. I still don’t sense anything unusual at all.”<br/>
<br/>
“Chances are everyone else is also in the dark.”<br/>
<br/>
“We can come back another time, and those empty crystals might still be here.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sighed. “What you say isn’t wrong.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shrugged. “Even if it is wrong, we can’t just linger here. Let’s go, let’s go.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong followed Ning Zhuo, head hanging in disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
But the next moment, a star became visible in broad daylight!<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon around Ning Zhuo’s waist suddenly glowed with a cluster of starlight.<br/>
<br/>
Although it wasn’t dazzling, it immediately resonated with the star in the clear daytime sky.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, far away in Wooden Wheel Town—<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling stood upon a ritual platform. Her eyes suddenly widened, revealing a vicious, excited expression: “Finally, finally, I’ve found you!”<br/>
<br/>
“You old monster sealed in stone!!!”<br/>
<br/>
“For daring to take what’s mine, you will die!”<br/>
<br/>
Divine ability incantation —Starfall Heavenly Punishment.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, drops of starlight gathered in the high skies, then hurtled down toward Ning Zhuo, who wore the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon around his waist.<br/>
<br/>
A trail of starlight extended into a straight line above.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt impending doom!<br/>
<br/>
“Quick, hide in the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, and we’ll slip through the void,” Sun Lingtong shouted in alarm.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also intended to do just that, but the moment he tried to act, the trap mechanism ring on his finger abruptly tightened.<br/>
<br/>
A warning!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo became suspicious: “Does it mean that even if I hide in the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and take shelter in the void, I’ll still be shot dead by this starlight?”<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, he was entirely uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo frozen in place, Sun Lingtong panicked, rushed to his side, grabbed his arm, and tried to pull him into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, Ning Zhuo communicated via divine sense, informing Sun Lingtong of the ring’s warning and his speculation.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong paused where he was.<br/>
<br/>
On a nearby mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The squad of cultivators who had once guarded Bikun Mountain all wore shocked expressions as they watched the starlight fall, leaving a perfectly straight, thin line.<br/>
<br/>
“What spell is that?”<br/>
<br/>
“Who could be attacking?!”<br/>
<br/>
“Good thing we left here in advance. Otherwise, that attack would have hit us.”<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators were amazed but also deeply relieved.<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo felt a hollow sense of dread and relayed this feeling at once to Sword Elder: “I want to go back and check!”<br/>
<br/>
Sword Elder immediately refused. “You cannot go!”<br/>
<br/>
“This starlight’s aura is incredibly concentrated, and you’ve gravely underestimated its power.”<br/>
<br/>
“Not even a hundred of you could withstand it.”<br/>
<br/>
Gao Cuo’s heart pounded. “What?!”<br/>
<br/>
Sword Elder snorted. “Kid Gao, you’re still too young to see it.”<br/>
<br/>
“This attack contains the aura of a principle, yet it remains a spell—likely a divine ability incantation.”<br/>
<br/>
“It being a divine ability incantation wouldn’t matter so much, except that it carries the mighty national power of Two Note Nation —and two streams of it at that!”<br/>
<br/>
At this, Gao Cuo’s expression shifted abruptly. “What?!”<br/>
<br/>
Military power exerts influence only in the vicinity of that army.<br/>
<br/>
But national power can act anywhere within its borders.<br/>
<br/>
By rights of law, Thousand Peaks Forest was part of Two Note Nation’s territory, and thus it was being ravaged by the national power of Two Note Nation!<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, the threat of death enveloped Ning Zhuo’s mind.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suddenly let go, no longer focusing on Ning Zhuo. He seized the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and fled through the void.<br/>
<br/>
“Boss!” Ning Zhuo’s face changed color.<br/>
<br/>
He knew Sun Lingtong intended to steer the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon away on his own, drawing off the attack so that Ning Zhuo could escape.<br/>
<br/>
However, even though the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon left his body, that starlight had already permeated Ning Zhuo’s entire being, causing radiant beams to shoot from him.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s no use.” Sun Lingtong, in the blink of an eye, returned to the same spot with the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
He was far more adept at controlling it than Ning Zhuo was.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s face was ashen as he communicated via divine sense: “I darted into the void just now, but the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon still radiated starlight. It’s still locked onto us!”<br/>
<br/>
“I have an intensely strong premonition that this starlight can travel through the void as well!”<br/>
<br/>
The void was not safe.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nearly forgot to breathe. Under this overwhelming pressure, his thoughts still moved quickly, icy-cold and clear.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a spark flared in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
He whipped around and looked toward the bottom of Bikun Pool—or, to be precise, that spot where only Sun Lingtong could see a formed empty crystal.<br/>
<br/>
“Our only chance of survival!” The conviction welled up within him.<br/>
<br/>
And when he tried to move toward the bottom of the lake, the trap mechanism ring on his finger abruptly stopped tightening and fell still.<br/>
<br/>
This tangible change was powerful evidence. Ning Zhuo’s spirits soared!<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, let’s hide under that place!” Ning Zhuo took immediate action, diving into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
With the unspoken understanding they had long possessed, Sun Lingtong did not hesitate. He followed Ning Zhuo’s suggestion at once.<br/>
<br/>
They dove to the bottom of the lake, ducking beneath that block of formed empty crystal.<br/>
<br/>
Almost at the same time, the Starfall Heavenly Punishment struck the surface of the lake, penetrating the water and firing deep below.<br/>
<br/>
The formed empty crystal and the Starfall Heavenly Punishment collided!<br/>
<br/>
Yet there was no explosion, no blinding flash, nor any raging shockwave.<br/>
<br/>
The thin line of starlight focused on the empty crystal’s surface, radiating a spherical ball of light that wasn’t particularly dazzling, glowing only about as brightly as a candle flame.<br/>
<br/>
But Sun and Ning both paled.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the dragon’s head cabin, alarms blared frenetically! The alarms screeched more shrilly than ever before!!<br/>
<br/>
In the duel of spear versus shield, only then, by relying on the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, did the two of them glimpse the terrifying power hidden in that beam of starlight.<br/>
<br/>
“This power of water —this familiar aura —it’s the national power of Two Note Nation!” Ning Zhuo gasped out loud.<br/>
<br/>
His mouth went dry, his scalp tingled, and his chest felt tight as if something had seized his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Crack, crack.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning both felt their hearts lurch. They saw cracks forming all over the surface of the empty crystal.<br/>
<br/>
The web of cracks rapidly spread across the entire crystal!<br/>
<br/>
If the crystal couldn’t hold out, the two of them would be doomed.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next instant, a bone appeared from within the empty crystal.<br/>
<br/>
It was a grayish bone, its surface bristling with barbed spikes, radiating a baleful aura.<br/>
<br/>
“This is an Evil God Bone!” Sun Lingtong exclaimed, suddenly enlightened. “So that’s it! A fragment of a void evil god’s bone drifted through the void until one day it fell into Bikun Pool, ultimately hiding in this block of empty crystal and causing something wondrous to occur.”<br/>
<br/>
Despite Sun Lingtong’s natural talent, he still could not observe the Evil God Bone ordinarily.<br/>
<br/>
But at that moment, forced to reveal itself, the Evil God Bone unleashed its tremendous power!<br/>
<br/>
Within the crystal that housed it, multiple overlays suddenly appeared, as if a thicket of empty crystal clusters had suddenly sprouted.<br/>
<br/>
Space fluctuated violently!<br/>
<br/>
“Not good,” Sun and Ning exclaimed, scrambling to control the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and shift through the void.<br/>
<br/>
Space convulsed for no apparent reason, churning like a stormy sea. Innumerable shards of space swept across the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon from every side, slicing it like a death by a thousand cuts!<br/>
<br/>
Within the Starfall, the full might of national power erupted completely.<br/>
<br/>
The starlight penetrated the space, piercing that layer of translucent shell before jabbing into the Evil God Bone.<br/>
<br/>
On the surface of the Evil God Bone, countless sigils emerged —snakelike, wormlike, bending and coiling.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt a wave of intense dizziness just by glancing once. He quickly looked away.<br/>
<br/>
But Sun Lingtong kept his eyes wide, transfixed by these sigils.<br/>
<br/>
Though mysterious and forbidding, the Evil God Bone was ultimately just a remnant. More and more starlight seeped into it, sinking deeper and deeper.<br/>
<br/>
Crack.<br/>
<br/>
A fissure opened across the Evil God Bone.<br/>
<br/>
Space twisted intensely. A marrow as dazzling as starlight began to seep through that fissure.<br/>
<br/>
The starlight flared, unleashing a terrifying brilliance in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
All the national power burst forth, crashing into the bone marrow —but that was taken in, absorbed by layer upon layer of space, an uncountable number of them.<br/>
<br/>
It lasted only a few breaths, but to Sun and Ning, it felt as though years had passed!<br/>
<br/>
All the empty crystals vanished, completely dissolved by the starlight.<br/>
<br/>
The Evil God Bone also melted into the starlight, like snow under the sun.<br/>
<br/>
Only the bone marrow remained, still sparkling as though packed with diamonds —its brilliance entirely unabated, outshining even the starlight.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was corroded by thousands of scattered beams of starlight, punctured by countless pinholes.<br/>
<br/>
Space continued trembling violently. For Sun and Ning, it was like being swept up by a tidal wave! The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon had become a battered ship on the verge of coming apart.<br/>
<br/>
If the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon were destroyed, they would be instantly consumed by the cataclysmic spatial turbulence or annihilated by the starlight. They wouldn’t even have time to scream.<br/>
<br/>
The trap mechanism ring tightened to its utmost, seemingly about to sink into Ning Zhuo’s finger bone.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong cast a glance at Ning Zhuo and bit down hard. “It’s no big deal if I die —but I can’t let Little Zhuo die!”<br/>
<br/>
“The marrow of a void evil god —this is my only chance.”<br/>
<br/>
He had no certainty. He could only gamble everything.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong extended his arm, activating a certain imprint in his Sea of Consciousness.<br/>
<br/>
That imprint was the Void brand!<br/>
<br/>
A miracle occurred.<br/>
<br/>
The Evil God Bone marrow, as though guided, swept into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon like homing swallows, slipped into Sun Lingtong’s Sea of Consciousness, and fused with the Void brand.<br/>
<br/>
In that instant, Sun Lingtong’s eyes opened wide—his mind swelled so severely it felt as if it might explode!<br/>
<br/>
His Thieving Technique’s power skyrocketed!<br/>
<br/>
Led by sudden inspiration, he used the Thieving Technique to augment the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and took the controls in person.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon came alive, maneuvering deftly through the treacherous, ever-shifting void, swiftly distancing itself from the starlight and fleeing for dear life.<br/>
<br/>
“B—Boss!” Ning Zhuo was astonished and overjoyed, hardly able to believe it.<br/>
<br/>
“You’re incredible!”<br/>
<br/>
“How did you manage that?!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong planted his hands on his hips, about to burst out laughing —then, as soon as he opened his mouth, a massive spurt of fresh blood poured out.<br/>
<br/>
As it sprayed forth, his eyes rolled back and he collapsed on the spot.</div>
