<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“Even a mid-section flank attack is no good?!” Upon seeing the Iron Deer Mountain God kneel in defeat, the Purple Jade Mountain God's heart grew unbearably heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Red Sleeve Fairy beside him looked at Him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He sighed and looked back: “Red Sleeve, I have also treated you to several rounds of drinks. Don’t look at me with that kind of gaze —it’s rather creepy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Red Sleeve Fairy’s voice was very delicate, yet her words were very cold: “It’s your turn.” “Once you finish here, my work will be done, and I can go to the Army Commander to claim my reward.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Can you hurry and deliver it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Purple Jade Mountain God was quite speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After several moments of silence, he sighed: “Forget it, you see me off for a while.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Red Sleeve Fairy then laughed and promptly and efficiently displayed her divine skill of moving mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“You also go!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The last of the Purple Jade Giant Wooden Mountains appeared before the Steel Torrent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Mountain God floated in the air atop the mountain, his hands clasped, unfolding his formation, causing the entire Purple Jade Giant Wooden Mountain to emanate a glimmering purple light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The purple radiance enveloped the Steel Torrent, which immediately emitted a piercing hissing sound, and billowing steam rose from the torrent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The power of the Steel Torrent was endless, and soon it shattered the Purple Jade Giant Wooden Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">However, unlike the previous giant wooden mountains, even when the Purple Jade Giant Wooden Mountain collapsed, it only turned into countless Purple Jade light dots, drifting in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Purple Jade Mountain God’s face turned ghastly pale, but with a smile, he reached out and gathered all the Purple Jade light dots into his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Eh?” Many Nascent Soul-level cultivators who witnessed this scene were slightly astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">A gleam flashed in Zhu Xuanji’s eyes: “This Mountain God has some schemes. He actually took advantage of the enemy army’s spearhead to assist his own mountain body’s defense, transforming it into his own divine body foundation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He secretly noted the Purple Jade Mountain God in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Lin Bufan nodded in agreement: “To achieve this step is not simple at all. It seems that the Purple Jade Mountain God very likely is a mountain spirit who has cultivated to become a deity. Or perhaps, a deity has used the soul-snatching technique to use the mountain as its flesh body.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Du Tiechuan also took note of this Purple Jade Mountain God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“He does have some methods.” He, who controlled the entire army, possessed the most extensive and profound perception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Although the heavily armored main force charged through the Purple Jade Mountain Peak, they themselves became covered with many purple light dots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">These light dots quickly expanded among the armor and dark shadows, becoming patches of purple light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Under the scorching of these light patches, the soldiers’ body temperatures rapidly rose, their physical energy was consumed doubly, and their moisture quickly evaporated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Du Tiechuan observed for a while and reached a new understanding: “This must be a kind of light poison!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After consecutively charging down four large mountains —each with its own Mountain God and formation —the momentum of the entire heavily armored main force decreased by 20%.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Among the soldiers, those with weaker foundations were already feeling fatigued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“This will not do.” Du Tiechuan had long memorized the terrain map of the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He knew that the current main force had only charged through 30% of the journey, and had not yet covered even half of the distance to the target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Thus, he rather straightforwardly took out the National Power Brick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He directly tossed the National Power Brick behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The jet-black bricks —more than twenty in total —after being thrown into the jet-black Iron Torrent, immediately melted, transforming into surges of vigorous power that provided increased support to the heavy-armored troops!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Oh oh oh!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The soldiers let out excited shouts, as they felt a surge of vigorous power flowing in, sweeping away their fatigue and reinvigorating their spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Steel Torrent regained its peak might and continued to charge toward the heart of the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Their target is the Dragon King Giant Wooden Mountain; we must not let them succeed!” Lord Long’s face was shrouded in cold frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Beside him, Lu Hongtu’s divine sense transmitted his thoughts, comforting: “Lord Long, be at ease— the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth have already taken their positions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Lord Long did not hesitate and directly said: “Let the two of them act! I hope their performance will be worth their price.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth received the message but did not immediately act; instead, they chose to continue observing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">After not seeing any movement for a long time, Lord Long angrily ordered and sent a message to question them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth sneered and turned a deaf ear until, after Lord Long urged them three times, the White-clad Ghost Cultivator Tian Shuang finally gave a faint smile: “The time has come.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Black-clad Ghost Cultivator Di Hui was even more straightforward: “Act!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The two positioned themselves, one on the left and one on the right, atop two mountain peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Tian Shuang frequently manipulated finger formations with both hands, and eventually crossed his hands over his chest, as his magical power erupted like a flood at that moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">An extremely cold ghostly aura gathered around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He softly chanted, and the incantation echoed on the mountaintop: “Nether Ghost Fire, Tian Shuang Soul Condensation, open my Ghost Gate, unveil the Netherworld.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">In the next moment, the ghostly aura suddenly burned, transforming into a mass of deep blue Ghost Fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Ghost Fire was as large as a city, soaring upward, directly piercing the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">During this process, the Ghost Fire spread, forming the outline of a giant gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">On another mountaintop, Di Hui stomped his feet, and a three-dimensional formation immediately appeared around his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The formation circulated, spitting out countless spectral ghost auras.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He shouted in a deep voice: “Hell’s Phantom Spring, Di Hui Convergence, open my Ghost Gate, grandly welcome the departed souls.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In the next moment, the ghostly aura transformed into countless smoke and dust particles, spreading from the ground, following the traces of the Ghost Fire deployed by Tian Shuang, spreading upward and filling the entire outline of the giant gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The giant gate quickly became distinct, transforming into a tangible entity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Tian Shuang and Di Hui simultaneously invoked their combined-strike divine power, causing the two forces within the giant gate to quickly merge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The two ghost cultivators simultaneously roared: “Heaven and Earth interchanging, Yin and Yang reversing!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Ghost Fire and the spectral dust vanished with a roar, perfectly merging into a brand-new force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">At that moment, the enormous Ghost Gate was completely formed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">On the surface of the Ghost Gate was an immensely gigantic skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The skull had deep eye sockets and a mouth full of fangs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">It emitted a ghostly laugh, opened its mouth, which grew larger and larger until eventually it squeezed away the entire skull face, leaving only that huge mouth, which extended all the way to the door frame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">For a moment, ghostly mists rose and ghostly auras spread, as the nearby battlefield was enveloped in a chillingly cold and deep wintry atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Within the skull’s mouth, a black vortex rapidly spun, transforming into a path leading to the Netherworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Ghost Gate Tower soared into the clouds and was wider than a mountain peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Not good!” Du Tiechuan, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, considered changing the direction of the Steel Torrent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">But the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth cast their spells very quickly, and the Ghost Gate was rapidly formed; coupled with one of the Steel Torrent’s shortcomings —its difficulty in changing direction —this left Du Tiechuan no time to adjust, and he had no choice but to go with the flow, steering the Steel Torrent straight through, breaking into the Ghost Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Hahaha!” Lord Long, upon seeing this scene, turned his anger into joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lu Hongtu smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Many cultivators in the allied army also breathed a sigh of relief and let out deafening cheers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“We won, we won!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Who are these two ghost cultivators?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Obviously, they are the strong ones secretly arranged by Lord Long.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“They were even able to summon such a gigantic Ghost Gate; who on earth are these two ghost cultivators?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“Hahaha, Du Tiechuan, aren’t you capable of charging? Then charge into the Netherworld to kill the enemy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Many of the alliance cultivators lost their composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The grand battle began, and the terrifying might of the Steel Torrent truly frightened many people, leaving almost everyone deeply shocked. Especially upon seeing the Steel Torrent consecutively demolish four divine mountains with its invincible and unstoppable momentum, a shadow fell over everyone’s hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The ingenious tactic of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, like a sword of sunlight, instantly pierced through the heavy shadow in everyone’s hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Since it was impossible to block the Steel Torrent head-on, then open another path —letting them charge elsewhere!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This was the tactic arranged by the Dragon King Temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Lord Long was the one who executed it, and for that, he spared no expense in hiring the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth to assist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Commander, how should we proceed?” a deputy general beside Du Tiechuan asked impatiently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Du Tiechuan snorted coldly, his face full of determination: “Keep charging!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Steel Torrent, without hesitation, carrying a ferocious impact force, collided with the Ghost Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A large amount of the armored torrent in the center charged into the Ghost Gate, stepping from the world of the living into the Netherworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">But the Steel Torrent on both sides continuously crashed against the door frame of the Ghost Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The door frames on both sides immediately emitted crackling sounds, shaking and on the verge of collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The faces of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth changed simultaneously; they expended their foundations, consuming a large amount of treasured materials, and temporarily created the strongest Ghost Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">It can be said that the strength of this Ghost Gate had already broken their personal records —the hardest one ever!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">However, having just endured the impact, it could no longer hold up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The next scene even more startled the two ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The gigantic skull on the Ghost Gate emitted a wailing sound and, surprisingly, began to try hard to close its mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“Swallowing Heaven and Ghost Gods?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth had never seen the ghost god they summoned suffer so painfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">This ghost god was just like a duck, being picked up by the neck and forcibly stuffed with food into its mouth and neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">At this moment, his arrogance dissipated like smoke, as he felt he had eaten too much —swelling as if he were about to explode!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Just when he felt he could no longer sustain it, the Ghost Gate first could not hold up, emitting a muffled roar, then tilting, collapsing into the Steel Torrent, smashing out countless illusory splashes of black ink, and quickly being washed away into rubble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">And the path to the Netherworld, in an instant, became ethereal and elusive, dissipating like clouds and mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The road ahead of the heavy-armored main force once again became incredibly solid, reverting to the mountain path of the living world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth suffered backlash, their auras plummeting. The two were filled with astonishment and doubt, their figures wavering as they immediately activated a small teleportation array to leave the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The Steel Torrent continued to surge, and all the mortal mountains along the way kept collapsing, shaking the heavens and the earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">However, the heavy-armored troops also lost 20% of their forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">They did not perish but instead became lost in the Netherworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">This was the first time since the release of the Iron Flow Levels the Plains military strategy that they suffered a heavy blow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">But such a result could not satisfy the allied army of Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Because the enemy’s main force still remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth were already strong reinforcements beyond their expectations, but the might of the Ghost Gate was not sufficient to suppress the enemy forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“With such might, can we really stand against them?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“This is the greatness of the cultivation realm! Du Tiechuan, one of the top generals —I truly understand the significance of this position today.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“A newly formed army, with such heavy enhancements, has acquired the might of a deity. Sigh…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Seeing that the cultivators’ expressions were dejected and disheartened, Lu Hongtu immediately spoke up, encouragingly: “It doesn’t matter.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“I have long already devised a clever plan to deal with Du Tiechuan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“Next, no matter what choice he makes, he will suffer a heavy blow.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Upon hearing this, everyone’s eyes immediately lit up, all looking toward Lu Hongtu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“Great Cave Master, what is your plan?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“Quick, please tell us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Lu Hongtu smiled: “Just watch and see.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The Steel Torrent charged all the way, rampaging through the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">After the Ghost Gate, they did not encounter any other obstacles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">However, in Du Tiechuan’s heart, there was an increasing sense of foreboding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He silently pondered: “The situation is strange! Given the abilities of Lord Long and Lu Hongtu, there will definitely be other contingencies.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“What could it possibly be?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The two main forces of the national army continuously advanced, gradually spotting a giant wooden mountain with a dragon’s head, towering into the clouds. The surrounding mountains only reached half its height, making it extremely conspicuous like a crane standing among chickens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">“Target acquired!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">“The Dragon King Giant Wooden Mountain, where the Dragon King’s main temple is located!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">“Demolish it, and the enemy’s morale will surely plummet —even the Ginseng-Whisker Dragon King will suffer a loss in strength.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Within the Steel Torrent, the soldiers were all invigorated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">They rushed here wildly, and even with multiple martial strategies bolstering them, they still felt fatigued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo’s condition was generally better than those around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">This was thanks to the Fetal Breathing Spirit Boat, which in a short period of time allowed his physical foundation to leap forward dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Although he participated in the battle, more of his energy was devoted to comprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">He continuously comprehended the "Iron Flow Levels the Plains" military strategy, making great progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">His understanding of the military strategy had become more intuitive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">When the army first started moving, he could only sense over three hundred people around him. But as he actively comprehended it and his understanding increased, he could now sense over five hundred people nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Not only that, he could sense the vague thoughts of over a hundred people around him, and perceive the emotions of more than two hundred people nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">“If I can sense the vague thoughts of all the soldiers in the entire army, I might be able to completely comprehend the Iron Flow Levels the Plains strategy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo vaguely had such an insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">On the side of the allied army of Thousand Peaks Forest, chaos and disarray had already set in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Someone questioned Lu Hongtu: “Strategist, now the enemy has already attacked our main base. What is your plan?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Lu Hongtu laughed heartily: “Precisely at this moment, everyone just watch!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">In the next moment, on the mountain path before them —as if a layer of canvas was unveiled —a military camp suddenly appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Within the camp, the soldiers defended it strictly, and the military flags fluttered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“Ah?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">For a moment, both sides, enemy and ally, were shocked and cried out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">It was because this suddenly appearing camp was none other than the vanguard of the two national armies!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The vanguard of the two national armies, clearly being surrounded by layers of toxic miasma on another battlefield —how could they appear here?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Most of the cultivators in the alliance were extremely puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Du Tiechuan was the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">He sent out scouting cavalry, who ventured deep into the toxic miasma —costing many lives —and only then discovered that the vanguard had consolidated its defense and was temporarily safe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">But now, this army was unexpectedly here!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Even the entire vanguard soldiers were very puzzled and shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">They had always thought that they were defending in place, so how come, all of a sudden, they had changed location and arrived deep in the enemy’s lair?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Without time to even consider this, they soon found themselves in a desperate situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">The Steel Torrent was right before their eyes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">The vanguard said: “Is that Commander Du’s Steel Torrent? Not good, we simply cannot hold it off!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Du Tiechuan’s deputy general was astonished: “Commander! Quickly change direction —ahead is the vanguard, our allies. If we charge through and massacre them, our morale will surely be severely shaken!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">The allied army of Thousand Peaks Forest all exclaimed in shock, and then cheered continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">“Brilliant, what a brilliant tactic!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">“Army Commander, as expected of you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">“A brilliant plan, indeed a brilliant plan!!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
