<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 217: The Spectacle Backfires</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit eavesdropped on the conversation among Zhu Xuanji and the other Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">It hadn't been long before it felt something was amiss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">It clenched its dragon claws into fists and repeatedly pounded on the armrests of its throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"It wasn't the City Lord's Mansion that bombed the Immortal Palace, it was Ning Zhuo! What are you all doing? What are you doing?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gnashed its teeth, its face full of frustration and disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">It desperately wanted to eliminate Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Among all its competitors, Ning Zhuo posed the greatest threat to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Yet, Zhu Xuanji, whom it had high hopes for, had single-handedly misled all the Golden Core ancestors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"What kind of divine constable are you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"What are you even doing? You're a disgrace to the title of divine constable!" However, as the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit continued to listen, it gradually fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Don't say it, just don't say it..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Based on the clues Zhu Xuanji has gathered, his guess actually makes a lot of sense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit put itself in Zhu Xuanji's shoes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">If it were thinking from Zhu Xuanji's perspective, it would indeed suspect the City Lord's Mansion the most.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"But... why did things develop this way?" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit asked itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It quickly found the answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"It's all Ning Zhuo's fault!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"He's too good at pretending, too good at hiding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"But then again, who would have thought that a mere teenager, only sixteen years old, with just the third level of Qi Refining, would dare to bomb the Immortal Palace?" Such behavior was audacious to the extreme, driven by greed to the utmost, and the young man's thin chest harbored ambitions beyond anyone's imagination!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">One must know that the entire Lava Immortal Palace was a legacy left by a Nascent Soul-level powerhouse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It was most reasonable for a Nascent Soul-level cultivator to become the master of the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">A Soul Transformation stage cultivator inheriting the position of the Lava Immortal Palace's master was most suitable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">At the Golden Core stage, it was barely acceptable, but Ning Zhuo wasn't even at these levels; he was just at the Qi Refining stage, the lowest tier in the cultivation world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">This feeling was akin to a small ant trying to eat a tiger or leopard, utterly laughable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">But the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't laugh at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Because it had witnessed Ning Zhuo surviving in the cracks between several major forces, calculating against them, controlling part of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">It had seen how Ning Zhuo's cultivation base swelled and skyrocketed, how he mastered the Life Thread Divine Ability, how he built his own small force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo was quietly, step by step, approaching the throne of the Lava Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">So far, no one had noticed him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Such experiences and characters were enough to be exciting and inspirational, but from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's perspective, it was a completely different feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">It wanted to regain its freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">If Ning Zhuo truly became the palace master, it had no confidence it could escape!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Ning Zhuo is just a little monster." Ning Zhuo was only at the Qi Refining stage, but he brought the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit the most genuine and heavy fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit continued to listen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">When it heard that these Golden Core ancestors planned to use Ning Zhuo as bait to lure the City Lord's Mansion into making a mistake and assassinate Ning Zhuo, it showed a satisfied and delighted expression for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"But... will the City Lord's Mansion really make a move against Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Although the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit eagerly anticipated this scene, reason told it that the possibility was not high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"If the City Lord's Mansion really makes a move, Ning Zhuo won't fare well and might lose his life here. If the City Lord's Mansion doesn't make a move, Zhu Xuanji and the others will sense something amiss, and Ning Zhuo will face more trouble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Realizing this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit understood that no matter the situation, it was beneficial to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It couldn't help but grin and laugh out loud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"No matter what, Ning Zhuo is in big trouble! Hahaha, serves him right!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Who told him to covet the Lava Immortal Palace with such little strength!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Not to mention anything else, just the secret attention of these Golden Core ancestors is enough to prevent Ning Zhuo from freely cultivating as before. In such a situation, he will face heavy surveillance, making it impossible for him to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Seeing Ning Zhuo so unlucky, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was genuinely happy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">It couldn't help but laugh heartily three times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Not long after laughing, it heard the Golden Core cultivators discussing Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">It heard Zhu Xuanji give the order for Ning Xiaohui to strive for the position of the Pavilion Chief of the Historical Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't laugh anymore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">At that moment, it suddenly realized that the unluckiest one was actually itself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Historical Pavilion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">This unique mechanical pavilion recorded all the major and minor events since the creation of the Lava Immortal Palace, along with detailed accounts of each event.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Many records in the Historical Pavilion were extremely valuable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Once Ning Xiaohui became the Pavilion Chief of the Historical Pavilion, she could easily access these records.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">All the small actions, schemes, and escape plans the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had made to free itself would be completely exposed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">It was like being struck at its most vulnerable point, and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit fell into extreme panic and confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"What to do? What to do?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"If Ning Xiaohui takes the position, everything will be known."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"What to do? What to do?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"If Ning Xiaohui takes the position, everything will be known." Yet, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's powers were limited, unable to interfere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">It could only watch helplessly as Ning Xiaohui quickly accumulated merits and smoothly became the Pavilion Chief of the Historical Pavilion in the near future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Xiaohui's success was almost inevitable because no one was competing with her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">On the path to the Immortal Palace, she was the only one with the status of a trial disciple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Xiaohui was now a healer and possessed the innate talent of the Ice Jade Hand, extremely skilled in repairing mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Her speed in accumulating merits far surpassed others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The position of Pavilion Chief of the Historical Pavilion wasn't high in rank, and even if she wasn't the Pavilion Chief, positions like verifier would still allow Ning Xiaohui to access the records in the Historical Pavilion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"What to do? What to do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Zhu Xuanji! You bastard, you're terrible at dealing with Ning Zhuo but hit my weak spot right away when dealing with me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"You're too ruthless, too ruthless! Why target me like this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"And why did the Ning family send Ning Xiaohui's good news at this time, letting Zhu Xuanji discover the Historical Pavilion?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Why am I so unlucky?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit paced anxiously in the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">It had been watching the spectacle, only to suddenly realize that the fire had spread to itself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">It could no longer remain calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Stop it, I must stop Ning Xiaohui!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">However, relying on itself alone was impossible because it was the spirit of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Facing someone with the status of a trial disciple, it couldn't make a move, nor could it casually reveal their information, not even lie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit struggled in the depths of despair, then suddenly paused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Wait a minute!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"I can't do it, but someone else can. Specifically, Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit wanted to use Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Ning Zhuo and I have the same goal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Ning Zhuo bombed the Immortal Palace, and Ning Xiaohui will surely discover this from the Historical Pavilion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Ning Zhuo can help me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit became excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In fact, besides Ning Zhuo, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit didn't dare contact anyone else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">It had previously informed Meng Chong of some key information from the perspective of the Lava Immortal Palace, without revealing its true identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"For now, I can only contact Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had no choice but to take this path to save itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo's Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The overturned house and floor had already been repaired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a mat, slowly healing himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">A group of Foundation Establishment cultivators surrounded him, their faces full of concern, constantly probing about what had happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"This is not something you can know. All of you, leave." Ning Zhuo's face was cold as he slowly closed his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Foundation Establishment cultivators had no choice but to leave the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">They closed the door and exchanged glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Each person's expression was grim, their brows furrowed with worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Under Zhu Xuanji's strong pressure, the force Ning Zhuo had just built showed signs of collapsing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The loyalty of these former stewards to Ning Zhuo was questionable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Moreover, the branch family members who had voluntarily joined Ning Zhuo mostly did so because they saw potential in Ning Zhuo's future, not because they were willing to risk their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Some admired Ning Zhuo's performance and achievements, but most supported him simply because there was no other option in the Ning family branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"What did Ning Zhuo do to make Lord Zhu Xuanji go to such lengths?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"He won't say anything. How can we know?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Keep a close eye on this matter. Something seems off."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Yes, Lord Zhu Xuanji's attitude is clearly unfriendly. Could it be that Ning Zhuo did something wrong?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
