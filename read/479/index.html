<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo returned to the Three Generals Barracks. Without resting, he immediately took out those four pieces of National Power Bricks in his own tent.<br/>
<br/>
The Two Note Kingdom was founded on the element of water. The four pieces of National Power Bricks that Ning Zhuo received as a reward were all as pitch-black as ink.<br/>
<br/>
On the surface of each brick, faint ripples could be seen, resembling dark currents in the depths of the sea.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had already tried drawing upon the nation’s power before to aid his cultivation, and the effects were excellent. Now, he was even more skilled at it. Sitting cross-legged on a meditation mat, with clouds of mist hovering around him, he formally began to absorb the nation’s power.<br/>
<br/>
In his hands, the National Power Bricks did not show any obvious changes. Threads of power seeped into Ning Zhuo’s body.<br/>
<br/>
Tenfold!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could clearly feel that, for the same amount of nation’s power being infused, his cultivation was increasing ten times more than before!<br/>
<br/>
“Now that I’ve become Mu Lan’s husband, these four National Power Bricks are equivalent to forty of them for me.”<br/>
<br/>
He had really struck it big!<br/>
<br/>
Previously, during the ambush battle, Ning Zhuo had indeed put in a lot of effort. He would have to go through this kind of battle nine more times, each time taking the risk of perishing and also earning roughly similar military merits, just to possibly get forty National Power Bricks.<br/>
<br/>
But merely by changing his status, the absorption efficiency of these National Power Bricks skyrocketed to such a degree. It reduced so many risks and saved him so much time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
What was most crucial was that this treatment would last for a long time, until Ning Zhuo and Mu Lan separated.<br/>
<br/>
There was nothing more to say; next, he simply had to keep absorbing National Power Bricks.<br/>
<br/>
A massive amount of national power poured into him, quickly dissolving and converting into Ning Zhuo’s cultivation in the three dantians.<br/>
<br/>
Spirit, Qi, and Essence!<br/>
<br/>
The three great dantians —the Bright Mirror Spirit Light Dantian, the Five Qi Heavenly Pivot Dantian, and the Blood Earth Devil Tendon Dantian —were soon filled to bursting, giving Ning Zhuo a feeling of swelling pain.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly activated the three supreme methods, working to digest the power actively.<br/>
<br/>
Because the transformation via the National Power Bricks was thoroughly direct, Ning Zhuo’s “digestion” speed was extremely fast.<br/>
<br/>
In this way, he repeated the process countless times. By the time dawn arrived the next day, Ning Zhuo had finally absorbed three of the National Power Bricks completely, leaving the remaining one temporarily unused.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, whenever he circulated any of the three supreme methods, he felt a swelling pain coming from the corresponding dantian. Each of the three had temporarily reached a bottleneck, all hitting the limit that those dantians could bear at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
In the upper dantian, heaven and earth appeared like a colossal mirror, inside which countless small mirrors—numbered in the tens of millions—floated calmly.<br/>
<br/>
In the middle dantian, five flows of qi converged like pillars, supporting the sky and stamping the earth, a hundred times thicker and more magnificent than before.<br/>
<br/>
In the lower dantian, powerful blood tendons covered the land. Blood energy coursed through them swiftly, echoing with crashing waves.<br/>
<br/>
“With such progress, I’ve saved at least nine years of cultivation.”<br/>
<br/>
“These National Power Bricks are truly useful!”<br/>
<br/>
“Of course, my status as Mu Lan’s husband played a key role.”<br/>
<br/>
What came next was no longer just about accumulating cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo closed his eyes and entered a meditative state. He sensed the natural pulsation of his three dantians —upper, middle, and lower. This rhythm was filled with a mysterious Dao presence. Each of the three dantians had its own distinct rhythm, but upon closer examination, one could sense their subtle interconnection.<br/>
<br/>
“Next, I need to refine my cultivation and eliminate impurities, so the connection between the three dantians becomes even tighter.”<br/>
<br/>
Cultivation involved both addition and subtraction.<br/>
<br/>
The former was about increasing quantity; the latter was about improving quality.<br/>
<br/>
Such a process spaned a cultivator’s entire life. It was not unique to only the Foundation Establishment stage.<br/>
<br/>
Mirror Platform Spirit-Linking Art!<br/>
<br/>
The body is like the bodhi tree, the heart like a bright mirror stand. At times it must be wiped clean, so that no dust is allowed to cling.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s divine sea cultivation began to drop swiftly. In the Bright Mirror Spirit Light Dantian, countless mirror-like fragments of his divine sense, if any speck of dust or flaw was present, would scatter automatically.<br/>
<br/>
After discarding over a thousand mirror fragments of divine sense, the upper dantian became crystal clear.<br/>
<br/>
Using the same method, Ning Zhuo refined the Five Elements power and the blood essence.<br/>
<br/>
All three dantians’ cultivation decreased significantly, and there was no longer any sense of swelling pain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo began cultivating again. This time, no matter which of the three supreme methods he activated, he could sense a clear and open flow, like a broad, bright sky with no clouds, utterly unimpeded.<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, when he circulated any single method, it elicited a response from the other two dantians.<br/>
<br/>
When he poured in his full strength, the power in the other two dantians would even start to ripple.<br/>
<br/>
It was just that this ripple wasn’t particularly intense.<br/>
<br/>
“I have reached the first stage of Foundation Establishment—‘Opening the Fields Unhindered.’”<br/>
<br/>
At this very moment, Ning Zhuo was certain he had stepped onto the first rung of the Foundation Establishment stage.<br/>
<br/>
Opening the Fields Unhindered!<br/>
<br/>
Cleansing the mind and removing obstacles, opening up the dantians.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators had to clean out impurities in their cultivation, ensuring their dantian land remained free of foreign contaminants and unperturbed. This laid a clear foundation for future cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
To reach this phase, there were two main points.<br/>
<br/>
The first was that one’s cultivation had to reach the upper limit. Only by being unable to advance further could one clearly sense the impurities and conveniently weed them out.<br/>
<br/>
The second was the removal of those impurities. This required excellent methods. Many techniques achieved little in this area. Well-resourced cultivators may rely on a certain skill within the “Hundred Arts of Cultivation,” indirectly achieving impurity removal. Cultivators without those conditions could only muddle through and proceed to the next step, helplessly planting hidden risks for forming their golden core later on.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the National Power Bricks, Ning Zhuo met the first condition.<br/>
<br/>
And, because the three supreme methods he cultivated belonged to the top tier, eliminating impurities was remarkably easy!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took out the only remaining National Power Brick and began another round of absorption.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, he filled the three refined dantians to their limit, then slowly activated his techniques.<br/>
<br/>
This time, when he circulated a technique, the corresponding dantian could no longer advance, but the ripples in the other two dantians became incredibly intense.<br/>
<br/>
Under the intense rippling, the cultivation in those two dantians was drawn out and poured into the dantian where the technique was being used.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Ning Zhuo’s ears thundered. His vision went white, and he sank into an extremely wondrous sensation.<br/>
<br/>
The fusion of essence, qi, and spirit was profoundly stirring, as though he had returned to the time of opening the heavens and earth, molding earth, water, wind, and fire, yin and yang.<br/>
<br/>
When he regained awareness, his cultivation had dropped again by a large margin.<br/>
<br/>
This merging of the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit was not mere depletion; it generated a qualitative change within the corresponding dantian, tiny sprouts began to appear.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, with more merging of the three treasures, these sprouts would gradually grow into clusters of precious herbs.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these herbs compressed an equivalent portion of the three treasures—essence, qi, and spirit —yet each dantian’s herb differed in its composition.<br/>
<br/>
This was another stage in the early Foundation Establishment realm —“Growing Precious Herbs!”<br/>
<br/>
With help from the National Power Bricks, Ning Zhuo leapt past the first stage and was now ascending the second.<br/>
<br/>
After a bit more cultivation, Ning Zhuo used up the last National Power Brick as well.<br/>
<br/>
These newly sprouted “precious herbs” could be seen, from another perspective, as the distilled essence of one’s cultivation. In some sense, they bypassed the dantian’s capacity limit.<br/>
<br/>
Once the herbs matured and were actively absorbed —essentially consuming one’s “inner elixir” —it would cause the dantian’s capacity limit to break through. Most importantly, it would further fuse the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit!<br/>
<br/>
This was the gem of cultivation that the world of cultivation had developed to this day. It had gone through countless generations of refinement to reach this achievement.<br/>
<br/>
The fusion of the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit was the foundational requirement for forging the golden core.<br/>
<br/>
In ancient times, the probability of a cultivator forming a golden core was very low. When the secret of “Growing Precious Herbs” was popularized, it immediately triggered a surge in golden core cultivators at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Today, all new methods havd incorporated this secret, merging it into a unified whole, making it an important process that nearly every Foundation Establishment technique had to undergo.<br/>
<br/>
“I still need more National Power Bricks, and the more the better.” Ning Zhuo opened his eyes, finishing his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Upon reaching the stage of “Growing Precious Herbs,” a cultivator actually ended up spending more time cultivating each day than before.<br/>
<br/>
Some cultivators might train day and night but still never hit their limit.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly how much depended on the cultivator’s aptitude and the techniques they use, among other factors.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, Ning Zhuo was precisely in that situation.<br/>
<br/>
When he circulated the Mirror Platform Spirit-Linking Art, it would draw in the power of the middle dantian and the energy of the lower dantian.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, after one thorough invocation of the Mirror Platform Spirit-Linking Art, more precious herb seeds sprouted in the upper dantian, and the spirit sea, spirit energy, and spirit essence in the three dantians all decreased greatly. Among them, the divine power dropped the most, by ninety percent, while spirit energy and spirit essence each dropped by about thirty percent.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, whenever Ning Zhuo wanted to train his middle dantian, he had to first raise the three dantians’ spirit sea, spirit energy, and spirit essence to their highest levels and then begin.</div>
