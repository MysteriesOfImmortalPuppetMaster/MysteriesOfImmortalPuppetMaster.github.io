<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Xuanyuan Nine-Craft Platform!<br/>
<br/>
Xuanyuan (轩辕): “Xuan” (轩) referred to the ancient carriage with a covering or curtains, symbolizing noble and exalted status, as well as the lofty mandate of heaven and the power of far-reaching travel.<br/>
<br/>
“Yuan” (辕) referred to the two straight wooden beams at the front of the carriage for harnessing livestock, signifying guidance and the source of strength.<br/>
<br/>
“Nine-craft” (九工) represented nine different types of craftsmanship.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the Xuanyuan Nine-Craft Platform contained nine kinds of craftsmanship, serving as a mechanism base for constructing mechanical carriage frames.<br/>
<br/>
The entire base looked like a thick, elongated piece —very simple and empty —completely different from the majority of mechanical platforms, which tended to have strange shapes.<br/>
<br/>
It used a combination of wood and metal. The wood was thousand-year-old ancient Qianyu Elm and Blue Sea Agarwood, displaying a natural grain and a rustic atmosphere. The metal used was Taibai Radiant Gold, ensuring stability and durability.<br/>
<br/>
The platform’s surface was semi-translucent, containing countless talismans. These talismans varied in size —some were very detailed and densely packed, while others were large and occupied their own space.<br/>
<br/>
They emitted a faint arcane glow, gradually shifting over time.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes widened, nearly gleaming with light.<br/>
<br/>
He almost separated from the stone sphere and pounced onto the platform for a heartfelt embrace!<br/>
<br/>
He could not wait to channel his divine sense into it, his expression growing ever more excited.<br/>
<br/>
“Indeed, it’s just as recorded in the books. The nine crafts can each differ, and one can arrange them according to one’s needs.”<br/>
<br/>
“Marvelous, truly marvelous.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo examined it closely and discovered the nine crafts included fine carving, heavenly fire smelting, layered forging, stardust inlay…<br/>
<br/>
“It leaned toward intricate processing.”<br/>
<br/>
What Ning Zhuo needed was rapid manufacturing of mechanical puppets for mass production and large-scale repairs.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, even if it did not match perfectly, having this Xuanyuan Nine-Craft Platform would still boost his efficiency by more than ten times.<br/>
<br/>
Such an increase was already very significant! Ning Zhuo then looked over at the second mechanical platform.<br/>
<br/>
This platform resembled a scaled-down ancient palace, steady in form, its surface decorated with cloud motifs and dragon-shaped rune lines that were elegant and flowing.<br/>
<br/>
The palace’s main body appeared bronze in color, emanating a sense of time-worn age and weighty history.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the palace, the beams and columns were thick and rounded, subtly exquisite without showy workmanship, all of them rotating slowly.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo channeled his divine sense inside, he discovered that the palace-shaped mechanical platform was composed of countless gears and grooves. The structure was extremely intricate, with layer upon layer of tightly packed gears.<br/>
<br/>
“Xuan Palace Gear Platform!” Ning Zhuo immediately recognized it.<br/>
<br/>
“Its main value depends on what the central gear is.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued to probe with his divine sense, and before long, he saw a massive gear at the center, slowly rotating.<br/>
<br/>
“The Left-Right Treading Earth Gear?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt a stir in his heart and continued to observe, soon confirming that his earlier judgment was correct.<br/>
<br/>
The Up-Down Ascending Heaven Gear and the Left-Right Treading Earth Gear were a classic pair of mechanical accessories in mechanism arts.<br/>
<br/>
He then observed the third mechanical platform.<br/>
<br/>
This platform was cylindrical, resembling a large drum.<br/>
<br/>
The drum’s surface was painted red, while along the cylindrical sides was a depiction of an enormous deity. This deity held up the sky and stepped on the earth, with clouds swirling around his knees and shoulders to highlight his colossal figure. His entire body was packed with bulging muscles, conveying a powerful sense of strength at first glance.<br/>
<br/>
“Giant Spirit Shaping Platform!” Ning Zhuo recognized it immediately.<br/>
<br/>
This platform was very easy to identify.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, Ning Zhuo had coveted many platforms like this for a long time. He had only been able to admire them in books and secret records, tucking his fondness away in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Although mechanical platforms were not as expensive as pill furnaces or artifact-refining furnaces, they were still uncommon in the marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
In his more than ten years in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had hardly seen many mechanical platforms for sale.<br/>
<br/>
There was actually another important reason: Fire Persimmon Immortal City was a new city. Since its construction, due to the special circumstances involving the three-sect superiors and others, it could not be fully developed.<br/>
<br/>
Now, although Lava Immortal Palace had emerged, Fire Persimmon Immortal City was embroiled in even fiercer contention, making rapid development impossible.<br/>
<br/>
The function of the Giant Spirit Shaping Platform was to forcibly change the shapes of large materials.<br/>
<br/>
It also differed from most other mechanical platforms.<br/>
<br/>
It contained a ritual of inviting gods.<br/>
<br/>
The summoned god was the Giant Spirit God.<br/>
<br/>
Such a deity was always large and brawny, endowed with great physical power.<br/>
<br/>
This Giant Spirit Shaping Platform was only Golden Core-level, capable of summoning one Giant Spirit God at a time. If it were Nascent Soul-level, it could summon two Giant Spirit Gods, or a Giant Spirit God and a Craft God simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
Without a Craft God, the Giant Spirit Shaping Platform had to incorporate arrays and talismans for heating, lubrication, scorching, fixing, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
One Xuanyuan Nine-Craft Platform, one Xuan Palace Gear Platform, one Giant Spirit Shaping Platform!<br/>
<br/>
“One at Nascent Soul level, two at Golden Core level—three mechanical platforms at once! Who in the army were they planning to give these to?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, pleased as he was, also felt puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
When he wondered about it, the first person who came to mind was Princess of Mechanisms, Shuang Ling.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, in the Twin Rivers armies, only she used mechanical constructs, and she was at Nascent Soul level, wealthy enough to afford them.<br/>
<br/>
“Hehehe.” Sun Lingtong also connected the dots and chuckled slyly. “Little Zhuo, these mechanical platforms are probably all for that Shuang Ling.”<br/>
<br/>
“This time, we’d make her suffer!”<br/>
<br/>
“She was so arrogant at the auction, right? Retribution comes in time—hehe! Now that time had arrived.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, continuing to work alongside Sun Lingtong to control the stone sphere.<br/>
<br/>
“Old Stone Monster” darted around the battlefield, striking repeatedly. While Thousand Peaks Forest and the Twin Rivers Nation fought each other fiercely and bloodily, he made a huge profit.<br/>
<br/>
Stones with a jade-like sheen and dragon-scale patterns on the surface —Dragon Scale Stones.<br/>
<br/>
Dark blue or black in color, reminiscent of the night sky; when waved around, it left a trailing shadow in the air —Night Shadow Copper.<br/>
<br/>
Wood wrapped in bloodstains resembling a python’s coils —Python-Patterned Blood Cedar.<br/>
<br/>
A spiritual liquid that was green on top and blue on the bottom —Azure Sea and Blue Sky.<br/>
<br/>
A four-fingered bird claw seemingly cast in copper, extremely hard —Dead Vulture Claw.<br/>
<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
After stealing so many items, Ning Zhuo gradually caught on.<br/>
<br/>
“These platforms and precious materials appear to be part of the same set, meant for refining a certain mechanical creation…”<br/>
<br/>
“Old Stone Monster” plundered the transport convoy inside and out, front and back, left and right.<br/>
<br/>
The entire convoy fell into misery —if they were not killed, they were left robbed of everything, their morale utterly broken.<br/>
<br/>
A large-scale rout unfolded.<br/>
<br/>
This caused the Twin Rivers Nation’s Nascent Soul cultivators to lose the support of their army, and their combat power immediately fell by a notch.<br/>
<br/>
Floating Cloud Master and Mountain Master joined forces decisively, launching continuous combined strikes to hold off the decline.<br/>
<br/>
“The truly valuable treasures should be in the escorting officer’s storage pouch,” Sun Lingtong said, watching the swirling battle in midair, still quite excited.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then let’s wait and see.”<br/>
<br/>
Storage pouches, storage rings, storage belts, and such all had different carrying capacities; some were stronger, some weaker.<br/>
<br/>
The more, and the higher the grade of items you put inside, the more they consumed that capacity.<br/>
<br/>
Hence many times, transport teams or caravans were still necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of teleportation or high-grade storage equipment, the costs were more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
The escorting officer’s storage pouch held the army’s most precious supplies, but usually in small amounts, because precious items tended to be high grade, which naturally limited how much could be loaded inside.<br/>
<br/>
Boom boom boom!<br/>
<br/>
“Die…!”<br/>
<br/>
“Take this…!”<br/>
<br/>
Pop pop pop!<br/>
<br/>
“What a vicious spell…!”<br/>
<br/>
“Knave, curb your arrogance…!”<br/>
<br/>
Bang bang bang!<br/>
<br/>
“Try our boundless mountain clouds!”<br/>
<br/>
“Hmph, nothing special.”<br/>
<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning hid underground, watching the show with great interest.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Nascent Soul cultivators of the Twin Rivers Nation were few in number and gradually became overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
As the escorting officer defended himself in all directions, the storage pouch at his waist was struck and fell, landing on the ground right above the stone sphere.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng lunged forward, trying to grab the storage pouch.<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, arcane light flickered, and Old Stone Monster emerged, sucking the pouch into his grasp.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng shouted, “Senior Stone, isn’t this going too far?!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded and replied in a hoarse voice, impersonating Old Stone Monster, “Indeed, it is too much.”<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng froze, momentarily hopeful and about to continue pleading, but in the next moment, Sun Lingtong said, “You have worked hard. Better luck next time.”<br/>
<br/>
“I…” Chen Lingfeng nearly cursed aloud.<br/>
<br/>
Right after that, he watched, dumbfounded, as “Old Stone Monster” sank into the ground once more, disappearing from sight.<br/>
<br/>
The storage pouch had sealing methods and could not be opened immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning were patient and not in a hurry, continuing to observe the fierce battle.<br/>
<br/>
Upon seeing that the convoy’s military supplies were gone, the escorting officer felt a stab of pain in his chest and lost his will to fight. After urgently discussing the situation with Floating Cloud Master and Mountain Master, they promptly retreated.<br/>
<br/>
Thousand Peaks Forest’s ambushers gave chase for a while but dared not go too far.<br/>
<br/>
After all, they were in enemy territory, surrounded on every side.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the second ambush ended.<br/>
<br/>
“Hurry and find Old Stone Monster!”<br/>
<br/>
“He’s outrageous! He took almost all our spoils.”<br/>
<br/>
“We risked our lives to ambush that transport, and in the end, Old Stone Monster alone profited. I can’t stand it!”<br/>
<br/>
“Damn him, I hate him so much!! I finally see Old Stone Monster for who he truly is.”<br/>
<br/>
“That fellow used to be so quiet. Who would have thought his nature was like this? How despicable!”<br/>
<br/>
Many Golden Core- and Nascent Soul-level cultivators of Thousand Peaks Forest wore dark expressions.<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning had already used Earth Travel to leave.<br/>
<br/>
The report that the transport convoy had been ambushed and robbed of everything reached Wooden Wheel Town at once.<br/>
<br/>
When Shuang Ling heard the disastrous news, she at first could not believe it. “How could that be? Impossible!”<br/>
<br/>
“Why did such an important transport just happen to be ambushed?”<br/>
<br/>
“My mechanical platforms, and all my precious materials!!!” Shuang Ling was both furious and resentful, grinding her teeth.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually regaining calm, her eyes glinted coldly. “Hmph, Old Stone Monster! You took my belongings. As long as you remain in the Twin Rivers Nation, I can find you!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling produced a large array of machines and set up a ritual altar.<br/>
<br/>
The machines interconnected, inlaid into each other, and combined, forming a mechanical altar.<br/>
<br/>
She immediately stood upon it to perform the ritual.<br/>
<br/>
After the time for one stick of incense, a star appeared in broad daylight!<br/>
<br/>
A supernatural incantation —Stellar Concealed Illumination.<br/>
<br/>
The starlight twinkled, intending to pinpoint the thief’s location and direction.<br/>
<br/>
It failed!<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling’s face changed dramatically; she spat out a mouthful of blood, half-kneeling in place, her energy and spirit sinking.<br/>
<br/>
“How is this possible?”<br/>
<br/>
“Could Old Stone Monster have already left the Twin Rivers Nation?”<br/>
<br/>
The “Old Stone Monster” had already been dispelled. Sun and Ning were piloting the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, traveling through the void.<br/>
<br/>
They were just about to finish their passage back to the surface when Sun Lingtong suddenly cried out, “Wait!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was controlling the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon. He had also been studying the escorting officer’s storage pouch, trying to break through its anti-theft seals, when he saw bright starlight flaring on the pouch.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong reacted at once. “Someone’s tracking us!”<br/>
<br/>
“We absolutely can’t emerge now.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hurry, Little Zhuo —keep us moving through the void.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s prompt warning stopped Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt a jolt in his heart and continued navigating the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon through the void.<br/>
<br/>
During this process, Sun Lingtong repeatedly used thieving techniques on the storage pouch, as well as on all the looted treasures and mechanical platforms.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s hardly working at all.”<br/>
<br/>
“What method did they use? It’s so powerful!”<br/>
<br/>
“No, they must have tampered with these military supplies beforehand, which is why they could investigate and track us.”<br/>
<br/>
After grasping the truth, Sun Lingtong had no way to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
He was only at Foundation Establishment level, and though he cultivated Child’s Skill, it was not yet the mainstream approach in the Unempty Sect.<br/>
<br/>
“Let’s keep wandering around. I don’t believe they can track us endlessly.”<br/>
<br/>
Following Sun Lingtong’s strategy of delay, the two continued to try different things. Finally, the starlight faded completely and did not reappear.<br/>
<br/>
They lingered a bit longer in the void to confirm that the starlight stayed gone, and only then exited the void, returning to the real world.<br/>
<br/>
“Where are we?” Sun and Ning immediately tried to identify their location.<br/>
<br/>
“Azure Sky Mountain?” They soon realized they were in Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
More precisely, at Azure Sky Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
“Where did the defenders here go?”<br/>
<br/>
“There’s not a single soul!” Ning Zhuo wondered.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suddenly cried out, “That’s right, that’s right, Little Zhuo —let’s check the summit. The Azure Sky Pool there produces Air Crystals!”<br/>
<br/>
“With Air Crystals, we could improve the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and reduce the cost of traversing the void.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun and Ning proceeded cautiously up the mountain, finding no enemy presence whatsoever along the way.<br/>
<br/>
It truly was strange!<br/>
<br/>
They steered the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon into the Azure Sky Pool and saw a large area of Air Crystals forming on the lakebed.<br/>
<br/>
“These Air Crystals aren’t that big; most of them haven’t fully formed yet, so we can’t harvest them,” Sun Lingtong said in disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo suddenly grasped the situation. “I think I understand why this place was deserted.”<br/>
<br/>
“We have four armies marching on Thousand Peaks Forest. I know the routes taken by the Three-Generals Camp and the Red Flower Camp.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m not sure about the Barbaric Demon Camp or the Golden Halberd Army, but judging from what we know, I can guess.”<br/>
<br/>
“From Azure Sky Mountain’s position, it’s fairly deep inside Thousand Peaks Forest. It probably lay on the march route of one of the armies, so the defenders withdrew early.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Barbaric Demon Camp suffered heavy losses, so it’s unlikely they could have come this far so soon.”<br/>
<br/>
“That suggests it was likely the Golden Halberd Army!”<br/>
<br/>
“They were probably about to arrive.”<br/>
<br/>
As Sun Lingtong listened to Ning Zhuo’s analysis, he also observed the crystals at the bottom of the lake. “Little Zhuo, quit analyzing. Look at that small patch of Air Crystals—those have fully matured, so we can harvest them.”<br/>
<br/>
“It would be a shame to miss out!”</div>
