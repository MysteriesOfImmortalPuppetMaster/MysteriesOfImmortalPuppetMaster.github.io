<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The second wave of rumors has arrived!<br/>
<br/>
It perfectly followed the previous wave of rumors, stirring up a storm.<br/>
<br/>
In this second wave, many new details were revealed—how Zhu Xuanji, the divine constable, obtained clues about the Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
The rumor mentioned that Zhu Xuanji acquired a Mechanical Demon General.<br/>
<br/>
This mechanical construct possessed Golden Core Stage combat power and was a precious puppet lost from the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The original Demonic Dao Scripture was stored inside the Mechanical Demon General.<br/>
<br/>
After Zhu Xuanji obtained the Mechanical Demon General, he discovered that the scripture was missing.<br/>
<br/>
With his exceptional tracking abilities, he found clues from the Mechanical Demon General and traced them all the way to Yuan Dasheng of the Monkey Head Gang.<br/>
<br/>
He suspected that Yuan Dasheng had come into contact with the Mechanical Demon General in his early years and had stolen the Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
However, Yuan Dasheng had long been dead, and his corpse was obtained by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
This meant that the Demonic Dao Scripture on Yuan Dasheng had already been acquired by Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
The power of the second wave of rumors was far greater than the first.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, it involved Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, a Golden Core Stage cultivator, a member of the royal family, and a divine constable of the Divine Constable Division, had a noble status and immense reputation.<br/>
<br/>
Such a prominent figure being involved naturally sparked a lot of discussion.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the rumor was very detailed and convincing in many aspects.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the rumor spread, some cultivators wanted to visit Zhu Xuanji to confirm its authenticity.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji neither clarified nor denied it.<br/>
<br/>
This subtle attitude led many to ponder deeply and come to their own conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji secretly communicated with the other Golden Core Stage cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
They were also speculating and discussing who might have spread the rumor.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan clenched his fists and said angrily, "Who else could it be? If it's not one of us, it must be the City Lord's Mansion!"<br/>
<br/>
"We retrieved the Mechanical Demon General from the Demon Ape King's Court, and we had informed Meng Kui about this action. Meng Kui, being a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator, likely knows everything that happened in the King's Court," Zheng Shuangjun said with suspicion. "I don't understand. Why announce the matter of the Demonic Dao Scripture like this? If I were the City Lord's Mansion, I would secretly gather intelligence, confirm it, and then send a capable assassin to eliminate Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"Why announce these things? What's the purpose?" Zhou Nongying smiled slightly. "It's obvious—they want to clear their name!"<br/>
<br/>
"Because once Ning Zhuo is assassinated, it will likely be because demonic cultivators, influenced by the rumors, want to seize the Demonic Dao Scripture from Ning Zhuo and take the risk."<br/>
<br/>
"The City Lord's Mansion first muddles the waters and then secretly sends a powerful assassin to take Ning Zhuo's life."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if the assassin is captured and points to the City Lord's Mansion, they can deny it, claiming it was the assassin's personal action and that he is framing them after being caught."<br/>
<br/>
"This is an old trick used by many major forces," Zhou Nongying added.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core Stage ancestors fell into silence.<br/>
<br/>
They all felt an invisible pressure.<br/>
<br/>
"Truly worthy of Fei Si," someone sighed, expressing everyone's thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
In their view, Fei Si clearly realized that there might be a trap around Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
So, what was his approach?<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of whether there was a trap, he first took this step.<br/>
<br/>
He controlled public opinion before even starting to assassinate Ning Zhuo, already working to clear the City Lord's Mansion of suspicion!<br/>
<br/>
Tricky.<br/>
<br/>
Difficult to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
This was Zhu Xuanji's biggest impression from the second wave of rumors and from Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
"Besides clearing suspicion, he has another purpose," Zhu Xuanji's eyes deepened.<br/>
<br/>
He subtly observed the other Golden Core Stage ancestors.<br/>
<br/>
Carefully watching their expressions!<br/>
<br/>
It was clear that among all the Golden Core Stage cultivators, Ning Jiufan's face was the worst.<br/>
<br/>
He was under considerable psychological pressure.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji understood that Ning Jiufan was worried about something.<br/>
<br/>
"If there is a traitor among us, Ning Jiufan is the least likely."<br/>
<br/>
"Not only because he has a handle that threatens his own reputation, but also because Ning Zhuo is a genius cultivator of the Ning family." Zhu Xuanji was concerned about whether the rumor originated from the City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
The other Golden Core Stage cultivators seemed to assume this, but Zhu Xuanji, as a divine constable, never made judgments without evidence.<br/>
<br/>
"If the rumor didn't come from the City Lord's Mansion, then who could it be?" "Who knew I obtained the Mechanical Demon General?"<br/>
<br/>
From Zhu Xuanji's perspective, there were only two groups: the City Lord's Mansion and the alliance of him and the three families.<br/>
<br/>
After some thought, Zhu Xuanji said to the others, "Two waves of rumors in succession clearly indicate a mastermind behind the scenes. The current situation has undoubtedly become very serious."<br/>
<br/>
"We must increase our protection of Ning Zhuo. After all, Ning Zhuo is a genius cultivator of the Ning family. As I told Ning Jiufan before, I will do my utmost to protect his safety."<br/>
<br/>
"So, from now on, we will pair up and take turns guarding Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"All shifts will be arranged by me."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's words made some Golden Core Stage cultivators thoughtful.<br/>
<br/>
Although Zhu Xuanji and the three families' Golden Core cultivators had signed a contract, such constraints were not perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Just like locks and lock-picking techniques, they always evolve alternately.<br/>
<br/>
Contracts and oath-breaking methods are the same.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji didn't directly mention the concern about a traitor.<br/>
<br/>
He divided the six Golden Core cultivators, including himself, into three teams.<br/>
<br/>
Each team had two people.<br/>
<br/>
He ensured that the two Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou and Zheng families were not in the same team.<br/>
<br/>
This was to prevent the risk of a traitor.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's residence.<br/>
<br/>
"What?!"<br/>
<br/>
"There's such a rumor?!!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shouted, unable to sit still, and stood up directly.<br/>
<br/>
His face was pale, trying to stay calm, but he couldn't hide his panic.<br/>
<br/>
The two Ning family Foundation Establishment cultivators who reported to him exchanged glances, feeling that from Ning Zhuo's reaction, the rumor was likely true.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered, and he held onto the desk, lost in thought for a while before coming to his senses and dismissing the two Foundation Establishment cultivators: "Keep a close eye on the rumors. If there are any changes, report to me immediately."<br/>
<br/>
After the two Foundation Establishment cultivators left, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but wipe his forehead.<br/>
<br/>
His forehead was covered in cold sweat.<br/>
<br/>
He swallowed, still feeling parched, and picked up the teapot on the table, drinking a large gulp of cold tea directly from the spout.<br/>
<br/>
He sat down again, opened a drawer, and took out a jade slip, using his divine sense to write.<br/>
<br/>
It was a letter of appeal, addressed to Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
After finishing, Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and took out another jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
It was another letter of appeal, this time addressed to Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
The two letters of appeal were quickly delivered to Ning Jiufan and Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
The content of the letters was roughly the same, expressing Ning Zhuo's innocence, grievances, and fear.<br/>
<br/>
The gist was as follows:<br/>
<br/>
"I really didn't get any Demonic Dao Scripture."<br/>
<br/>
"I am being wronged; I am innocent."<br/>
<br/>
"I am so unlucky to have encountered such a thing. Someone will definitely come to harm me, coveting the Demonic Dao Scripture."<br/>
<br/>
"They will be disappointed. Even if they kill me, they won't get the scripture!"<br/>
<br/>
"But I don't want to die. I am still young, only sixteen years old."<br/>
<br/>
"So, Lord Ning Jiufan (Zhu Xuanji), please save my life. Just clarifying the matter can resolve my crisis!"<br/>
<br/>
After reading the letter, Zhu Xuanji expressionlessly put the jade slip into his pouch.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was not indifferent.<br/>
<br/>
He secretly found Zhu Xuanji and, after some small talk, got to the point: "Lord Zhu, how much do you think Meng Kui knows about our actions in the Demon Ape King's Court?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji replied, "Meng Kui is at the Nascent Soul Stage, his cultivation and combat power far surpass ours."<br/>
<br/>
"Before the action, I specifically informed him so that he could be our backup."<br/>
<br/>
"With his abilities, he must have been aware of our actions in Fire Persimmon Mountain."<br/>
<br/>
"But..."<br/>
<br/>
"To what extent he is aware, I am not sure," Zhu Xuanji said, speaking vaguely.<br/>
<br/>
He also had his difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't directly tell Ning Jiufan that Meng Kui knew everything about what happened to him, could he?<br/>
<br/>
That would only increase Ning Jiufan's psychological pressure.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan sighed and left.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's face turned solemn.<br/>
<br/>
Righteous path confrontations were naturally different from the demonic path, with their own unique charm.<br/>
<br/>
"Regarding the rumors, I have already had a round of confrontation with the City Lord's Mansion."<br/>
<br/>
"Fei Si is indeed formidable."<br/>
<br/>
"Two rumors have already unsettled our formation."<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, a cultivator walked straight to the gate of Ning Zhuo's residence.<br/>
<br/>
His actions immediately drew attention.<br/>
<br/>
"Stop."<br/>
<br/>
"Who goes there?"<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family Foundation Establishment guards immediately intercepted him.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan also secretly focused on the person.<br/>
<br/>
The visitor cupped his hands politely, "I am Su Mo. Apologies for disturbing you, two Foundation Establishment seniors."<br/>
<br/>
"I am just a low-level Qi Refining Stage cultivator, making a living with some tricks."<br/>
<br/>
"I recently arrived at Fire Persimmon Immortal City and heard that the Ning family is renowned for their talisman crafting. And Ning Zhuo is the leading figure among the Ning family's Qi Refining Stage, a young genius."<br/>
<br/>
"So, I came to visit, hoping to exchange talisman crafting techniques with Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
The two Foundation Establishment guards exchanged glances, full of disdain.<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, you come now of all times? You must have ulterior motives."<br/>
<br/>
"Why not be honest? You're here because of the rumor about the Demonic Dao Scripture, aren't you?"<br/>
<br/>
Su Mo smiled slightly, "Seniors, it is indeed late at night, so I am 'coming late.'"<br/>
<br/>
"I don't know about any rumors."<br/>
<br/>
"I only know that I came to challenge Ning Zhuo. If Ning Zhuo doesn't respond, it would tarnish the Ning family's reputation as master talisman crafters."<br/>
<br/>
The two Foundation Establishment guards were even more disdainful.<br/>
<br/>
But this matter couldn't be easily dismissed and needed proper handling.<br/>
<br/>
