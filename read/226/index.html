<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 226: Truly Worthy of Fei Si</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The second wave of rumors has arrived!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">It perfectly followed the previous wave of rumors, stirring up a storm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In this second wave, many new details were revealed—how Zhu Xuanji, the divine constable, obtained clues about the Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The rumor mentioned that Zhu Xuanji acquired a Mechanical Demon General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This mechanical construct possessed Golden Core Stage combat power and was a precious puppet lost from the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The original Demonic Dao Scripture was stored inside the Mechanical Demon General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">After Zhu Xuanji obtained the Mechanical Demon General, he discovered that the scripture was missing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">With his exceptional tracking abilities, he found clues from the Mechanical Demon General and traced them all the way to Yuan Dasheng of the Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He suspected that Yuan Dasheng had come into contact with the Mechanical Demon General in his early years and had stolen the Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">However, Yuan Dasheng had long been dead, and his corpse was obtained by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This meant that the Demonic Dao Scripture on Yuan Dasheng had already been acquired by Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The power of the second wave of rumors was far greater than the first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">On one hand, it involved Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhu Xuanji, a Golden Core Stage cultivator, a member of the royal family, and a divine constable of the Divine Constable Division, had a noble status and immense reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Such a prominent figure being involved naturally sparked a lot of discussion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">On the other hand, the rumor was very detailed and convincing in many aspects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">As soon as the rumor spread, some cultivators wanted to visit Zhu Xuanji to confirm its authenticity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zhu Xuanji neither clarified nor denied it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This subtle attitude led many to ponder deeply and come to their own conclusions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zhu Xuanji secretly communicated with the other Golden Core Stage cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">They were also speculating and discussing who might have spread the rumor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Jiufan clenched his fists and said angrily, "Who else could it be? If it's not one of us, it must be the City Lord's Mansion!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"We retrieved the Mechanical Demon General from the Demon Ape King's Court, and we had informed Meng Kui about this action. Meng Kui, being a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator, likely knows everything that happened in the King's Court," Zheng Shuangjun said with suspicion. "I don't understand. Why announce the matter of the Demonic Dao Scripture like this? If I were the City Lord's Mansion, I would secretly gather intelligence, confirm it, and then send a capable assassin to eliminate Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Why announce these things? What's the purpose?" Zhou Nongying smiled slightly. "It's obvious—they want to clear their name!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Because once Ning Zhuo is assassinated, it will likely be because demonic cultivators, influenced by the rumors, want to seize the Demonic Dao Scripture from Ning Zhuo and take the risk."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"The City Lord's Mansion first muddles the waters and then secretly sends a powerful assassin to take Ning Zhuo's life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Even if the assassin is captured and points to the City Lord's Mansion, they can deny it, claiming it was the assassin's personal action and that he is framing them after being caught."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"This is an old trick used by many major forces," Zhou Nongying added.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Golden Core Stage ancestors fell into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">They all felt an invisible pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Truly worthy of Fei Si," someone sighed, expressing everyone's thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In their view, Fei Si clearly realized that there might be a trap around Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">So, what was his approach?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Regardless of whether there was a trap, he first took this step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He controlled public opinion before even starting to assassinate Ning Zhuo, already working to clear the City Lord's Mansion of suspicion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Tricky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Difficult to deal with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This was Zhu Xuanji's biggest impression from the second wave of rumors and from Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Besides clearing suspicion, he has another purpose," Zhu Xuanji's eyes deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He subtly observed the other Golden Core Stage ancestors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Carefully watching their expressions!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">It was clear that among all the Golden Core Stage cultivators, Ning Jiufan's face was the worst.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He was under considerable psychological pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhu Xuanji understood that Ning Jiufan was worried about something.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"If there is a traitor among us, Ning Jiufan is the least likely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Not only because he has a handle that threatens his own reputation, but also because Ning Zhuo is a genius cultivator of the Ning family." Zhu Xuanji was concerned about whether the rumor originated from the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The other Golden Core Stage cultivators seemed to assume this, but Zhu Xuanji, as a divine constable, never made judgments without evidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"If the rumor didn't come from the City Lord's Mansion, then who could it be?" "Who knew I obtained the Mechanical Demon General?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">From Zhu Xuanji's perspective, there were only two groups: the City Lord's Mansion and the alliance of him and the three families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">After some thought, Zhu Xuanji said to the others, "Two waves of rumors in succession clearly indicate a mastermind behind the scenes. The current situation has undoubtedly become very serious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"We must increase our protection of Ning Zhuo. After all, Ning Zhuo is a genius cultivator of the Ning family. As I told Ning Jiufan before, I will do my utmost to protect his safety."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"So, from now on, we will pair up and take turns guarding Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"All shifts will be arranged by me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zhu Xuanji's words made some Golden Core Stage cultivators thoughtful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Although Zhu Xuanji and the three families' Golden Core cultivators had signed a contract, such constraints were not perfect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Just like locks and lock-picking techniques, they always evolve alternately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Contracts and oath-breaking methods are the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zhu Xuanji didn't directly mention the concern about a traitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He divided the six Golden Core cultivators, including himself, into three teams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Each team had two people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He ensured that the two Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou and Zheng families were not in the same team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">This was to prevent the risk of a traitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"What?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"There's such a rumor?!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo shouted, unable to sit still, and stood up directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">His face was pale, trying to stay calm, but he couldn't hide his panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The two Ning family Foundation Establishment cultivators who reported to him exchanged glances, feeling that from Ning Zhuo's reaction, the rumor was likely true.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered, and he held onto the desk, lost in thought for a while before coming to his senses and dismissing the two Foundation Establishment cultivators: "Keep a close eye on the rumors. If there are any changes, report to me immediately."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After the two Foundation Establishment cultivators left, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but wipe his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">His forehead was covered in cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He swallowed, still feeling parched, and picked up the teapot on the table, drinking a large gulp of cold tea directly from the spout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He sat down again, opened a drawer, and took out a jade slip, using his divine sense to write.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">It was a letter of appeal, addressed to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">After finishing, Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and took out another jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">It was another letter of appeal, this time addressed to Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The two letters of appeal were quickly delivered to Ning Jiufan and Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The content of the letters was roughly the same, expressing Ning Zhuo's innocence, grievances, and fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The gist was as follows:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"I really didn't get any Demonic Dao Scripture."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"I am being wronged; I am innocent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"I am so unlucky to have encountered such a thing. Someone will definitely come to harm me, coveting the Demonic Dao Scripture."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"They will be disappointed. Even if they kill me, they won't get the scripture!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"But I don't want to die. I am still young, only sixteen years old."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"So, Lord Ning Jiufan (Zhu Xuanji), please save my life. Just clarifying the matter can resolve my crisis!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">After reading the letter, Zhu Xuanji expressionlessly put the jade slip into his pouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Jiufan was not indifferent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He secretly found Zhu Xuanji and, after some small talk, got to the point: "Lord Zhu, how much do you think Meng Kui knows about our actions in the Demon Ape King's Court?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Zhu Xuanji replied, "Meng Kui is at the Nascent Soul Stage, his cultivation and combat power far surpass ours."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Before the action, I specifically informed him so that he could be our backup."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"With his abilities, he must have been aware of our actions in Fire Persimmon Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"To what extent he is aware, I am not sure," Zhu Xuanji said, speaking vaguely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He also had his difficulties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He couldn't directly tell Ning Jiufan that Meng Kui knew everything about what happened to him, could he?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">That would only increase Ning Jiufan's psychological pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Jiufan sighed and left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zhu Xuanji's face turned solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Righteous path confrontations were naturally different from the demonic path, with their own unique charm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Regarding the rumors, I have already had a round of confrontation with the City Lord's Mansion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Fei Si is indeed formidable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Two rumors have already unsettled our formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">At this moment, a cultivator walked straight to the gate of Ning Zhuo's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">His actions immediately drew attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Stop."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Who goes there?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The Ning family Foundation Establishment guards immediately intercepted him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan also secretly focused on the person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The visitor cupped his hands politely, "I am Su Mo. Apologies for disturbing you, two Foundation Establishment seniors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"I am just a low-level Qi Refining Stage cultivator, making a living with some tricks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"I recently arrived at Fire Persimmon Immortal City and heard that the Ning family is renowned for their talisman crafting. And Ning Zhuo is the leading figure among the Ning family's Qi Refining Stage, a young genius."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"So, I came to visit, hoping to exchange talisman crafting techniques with Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The two Foundation Establishment guards exchanged glances, full of disdain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Hmph, you come now of all times? You must have ulterior motives."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Why not be honest? You're here because of the rumor about the Demonic Dao Scripture, aren't you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Su Mo smiled slightly, "Seniors, it is indeed late at night, so I am 'coming late.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"I don't know about any rumors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"I only know that I came to challenge Ning Zhuo. If Ning Zhuo doesn't respond, it would tarnish the Ning family's reputation as master talisman crafters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The two Foundation Establishment guards were even more disdainful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">But this matter couldn't be easily dismissed and needed proper handling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Alright, wait here. I'll go report this!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
