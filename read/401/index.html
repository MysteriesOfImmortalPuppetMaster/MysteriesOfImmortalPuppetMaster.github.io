<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 401: "Ning Zhuo is a Monster?!"</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lin Shanshan was startled and quite surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Ning Zhuo's root entanglement technique is much faster than before!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">She had been confined for some time, and although she had seen recordings of Ning Zhuo's battle with Hua Guzi, since then, the two had frequently practiced in the training grounds, and their magical abilities had progressed significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Ah." Linghu Jiu smiled faintly. "Brother Ning Zhuo, you're not the only one who can use wood-element magic."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">However, the ensnared Linghu Jiu suddenly dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">Then, he appeared out of thin air seven steps ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Wood-element magic — Phantom Bamboo Shadow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In the Myriad Medicine Sect, there were dozens of enlightenment diagrams related to the five elements magic. When Ning Zhuo was selecting wood-element diagrams with Lin Shanshan's help, he chose three from more than ten options.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Myriad Medicine Sect dealt with tens of thousands of medicinal herbs and had deep research into five elements magic. This was because using the five elements could modify environments to simulate optimal growing conditions for various herbs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">As the senior disciple of Myriad Medicine Sect, Linghu Jiu was raised and trained by Lin Bufan from childhood, naturally mastering multiple techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Linghu Jiu, sword in hand, continued charging toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo retreated consecutively, his magical power rising as he pushed forward with both palms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">Wood-element magic — Pine Wave Emerald Surge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">The sound of pine trees rose suddenly, and green light surged forward like huge waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">The smile on Linghu Jiu's face slightly faded as his whole body suddenly emitted a jade-like green light, tough and stable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">Wood-element magic — Bamboo Joint Resilience!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">Relying on this technique, Linghu Jiu withstood the pine waves, his entire body like a sharp sword, piercing through the emerald waves while continuing to close the distance with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">He was also familiar with much of Ning Zhuo's information, knowing that the latter excelled at magical attacks, while close combat was only recently developed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">There was no helping it - when Lin Shanshan practiced with Ning Zhuo, she was very enthusiastic and often told these things to her senior brother while bringing him meals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">Although this Linghu Jiu was only an image, it retained many memories of Linghu Jiu's true self.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">Seeing that two consecutive spells couldn't suppress his opponent, Ning Zhuo felt pressured. He quickly calculated that the remaining time and space only allowed for one final spell - how to choose was crucial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">Wood-element magic — Tree Realm Descent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">He still chose his most familiar Tree Realm Descent, a spell that combined both offense and defense, truly his favorite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">The next moment, ancient trees reached toward the sky, rapidly sprouting up one after another, countless branches and vines like snakes and pythons, entangling toward Linghu Jiu from all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">Ning Zhuo stood in an extremely dense tree crown, looking down at Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">The Tree Realm Descent spell was truly practical; with this wood-element magic, he had transformed the battlefield and gained terrain advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Of course, nothing in this world was perfect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">Tree Realm Descent's biggest flaw lay in its magical power consumption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">Compared to the previous two spells, its consumption was fifty times that of Root Entanglement and more than ten times that of Pine Wave Emerald Surge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">Ning Zhuo only had early Foundation Establishment Cultivation, and for ordinary cultivators, maintaining the Tree Realm Descent spell would be extremely difficult, lasting at most a dozen breaths before magical power was exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">But Ning Zhuo's Five Elements Qi Rhythm technique was a top-tier method from the Three Sects, extremely excellent, with clearly distinguished five elements power that could transform between each other. This gave Ning Zhuo the qualification to use this spell in actual combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">"How has this kid Ning Zhuo's combat power grown so much in such a short time?" Zhu Xuanji was shocked as he watched the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">He was also quite familiar with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">In the Magma Immortal Palace contest and the Misty Hidden Mountain battle, he had never seen Ning Zhuo display such powerful wood-element magic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">"Could it be what he learned during his time in the Medicine Valley?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">Zhu Xuanji's gaze flickered: "A child of destiny indeed cannot be judged by normal standards!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Linghu Jiu found himself surrounded in the ancient forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">His charging momentum was finally restrained by countless tree roots and branches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">While defending with his sword, Linghu Jiu circulated his magical power, gathering strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">His sword danced in brilliant patterns, cutting through roots and slicing through branches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">He temporarily broke free from the encirclement, assessed the battlefield, identified Ning Zhuo's direction, and suddenly cast a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Water-element magic — Jade Water Encirclement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">His magical power transformed into green water waves, encircling Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">This spell combined both offense and defense, and could assist Linghu Jiu's movement, carrying him toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">Most of the entangling roots and vines were blocked and deflected by the jade water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">Ning Zhuo naturally wouldn't wait passively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">Wood-element magic — Life-Stealing Bloom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">The next moment, numerous flower buds grew on the vines and tree roots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">These buds expanded in the wind after one breath. After the second breath, they all bloomed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">The vines and tree roots lost their magical power and instantly withered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">But the flowers detached from the tree vines, dancing through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">The petals were extremely sharp, like countless hidden weapons, encompassing Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">This wood-element spell was taught by Hua Guzi. Being able to use it on the foundation of Tree Realm Descent increased combat power several times over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Linghu Jiu recognized the danger and finally didn't dare to directly confront it. He let out a light shout and employed a new technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">The jade water encircling him was infused with magical power, suddenly tripling in volume.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Water-element magic — Triple Wave Turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">The jade water propelled Linghu Jiu, intensifying his momentum, suddenly changing direction toward the ground, avoiding most of the petal rain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with bright light, constantly controlling the petal rain, relentlessly pursuing Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">Countless pink petals flowed endlessly between the brown tree trunks and verdant branches, creating a beautiful sight. Yet the sharp offensive power contained within this beautiful scene made Linghu Jiu struggle to escape and made the watching Lin Shanshan hold her breath in tension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Linghu Jiu, encircled by jade water, crashed into the ground due to his excessive momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Second turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Linghu Jiu's direction abruptly changed, slanting upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">The petal rain behind him shot continuously into the ground, penetrating the entire root area, turning it into a pink deep pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Less than thirty percent of the petals remained, but being at the back, they were preserved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">"Must relocate now." While controlling the petal rain to continue pursuing, Ning Zhuo began to prepare another technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">His practice matches with Hua Guzi had yielded good results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">Now, he could maintain one spell while multitasking to cast another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Wood-element magic — Fragrant Flower Illusion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Ning Zhuo's figure disappeared from his spot, leaving only flower fragrance and some petals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Linghu Jiu missed. But the petal rain came charging through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Third turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">He exhausted his final turn, shooting straight up into the sky, surveying the entire battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">Seeing Ning Zhuo dodge away, Lin Shanshan felt bitter and thought to herself: "How many more spells did Hua Guzi teach Ning Zhuo? She taught him all these signature techniques?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">"They were clearly enemies before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">"Hmph. That fox seductress Hua Guzi! And Ning Zhuo... this blockhead is just too eager to learn!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">She silently assessed the battle situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Linghu Jiu's wood and water element magic combined both offense and defense, excelling in movement. Although Ning Zhuo only displayed single wood attributes, he was similarly capable. Fighting like this between them would inevitably become a battle of attrition and a tug of war.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">It would come down to their magical power reserves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">From this perspective, Linghu Jiu held the advantage. But Ning Zhuo himself had pills, and if he continuously took pills to replenish power, he could also engage in prolonged combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">"Besides this, if either side makes a mistake, it would cause a sudden change in the battle situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">The battle development that Lin Shanshan analyzed was naturally clear to both Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Linghu Jiu, suspended high in the air, called out: "Brother Ning Zhuo, this is a friendly match, not a matter of life and death. We might as well be more direct and unrestrained. Continuing like this wouldn't be elegant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">After all, powerful cultivators like Lin Bufan and Shen Lingshu were watching the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">Ning Zhuo nodded, thinking of his purpose to explore the Linlang Mirror Wall, and this battle with Linghu Jiu was just a prelude. He responded: "Brother's words make sense, this foolish brother will comply."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">Though he spoke, his true form remained hidden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Linghu Jiu laughed heartily: "Brother, take this move!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">The next moment, he spread his arms, extended his fingers, took a deep breath, and his magical power frantically consumed, transforming into a huge wave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Water-element magic — Three Thousand Water Strikes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">The huge wave poured down, flooding into the ancient forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">First strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">Most ancient trees collapsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Ning Zhuo hurriedly urged his power, consuming magical power to make new trees grow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Second strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">The newly grown ancient trees also broke under the water's impact, trunks and broken branches flowing with the waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly, understanding that Linghu Jiu was using force to win, relying on his cultivation advantage to crush him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">He decisively withdrew, stopping his magical power input to avoid an unfavorable magical power confrontation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Third strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">The few remaining ancient trees all fell, and the battlefield transformed into a small lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">Without vegetation cover, Ning Zhuo was forced to reveal himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">The terrain advantage was no longer his; he could modify the battlefield, but so could Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">Ning Zhuo felt emotional: "Compared to wood element, it seems Linghu Jiu is even more skilled in water element."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">"Brother, here I come!" Linghu Jiu dove down from high above, his qi piercing like a rainbow, his momentum fierce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Ning Zhuo's expression slightly changed as he alternately cast five elements magic to resist the attack while retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Linghu Jiu no longer used the Wine Forest Sword technique, but wherever his sword went, it was unstoppable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Ning Zhuo was in a very desperate situation, unable to counterattack. After more than thirty breaths, he had multiple wounds all over his body, bleeding unstoppably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Linghu Jiu snorted coldly: "Brother, what are you thinking? Bring out your mechanical creations!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Lin Bufan also frowned. Ning Zhuo excelled at mechanisms, yet until now he hadn't used them. Facing such a powerful opponent as Linghu Jiu, being so overconfident was unwise!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">But Ning Zhuo suddenly smiled and said: "Brother, was your Three Thousand Water Strikes used like this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Speaking, he pointed at the water flow below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">The next moment, the water flow rose like dragons and pythons, dozens of streams shooting upward toward Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Caught off guard, Linghu Jiu hurriedly wielded his sword light to defend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">First strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">Linghu Jiu retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Second strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Linghu Jiu's sword light scattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">The water flow dispersed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">The third strike ended without happening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">Ning Zhuo's eyes sparkled with excitement: "Oh oh, I was wrong, I got one point wrong. This time, it should be correct!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Water element — Three Thousand Water Strikes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Hundreds of water streams shot toward Linghu Jiu again, forcing him to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Lin Shanshan exclaimed: "This isn't Three Thousand Water Strikes at all, no, wait, this seems to be exactly Three Thousand Water Strikes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The Three Thousand Water Strikes technique was supposed to be three giant waves, surging and powerful. But when Ning Zhuo used it, it was like the earlier root movements, like dragons and pythons. Yet when the dragons and pythons struck together, they still contained the giant force of three strikes. This was still the principle of Three Thousand Water Strikes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Therefore, Lin Shanshan's words seemed contradictory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">All the observers were moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Learning in the midst of battle! How is this possible?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Is Ning Zhuo's comprehension ability really this heaven-defying?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Monster!!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
