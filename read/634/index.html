<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 634: Ning Zhuo's Mother Reforms the Army</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the Underworld, Ning Zhuo slowly descended from the sky. Beside him was Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, while Shadow Blade Night Tiger - Yehu and Heavy Armored Blood Ape - Dasheng flanked him on either side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Netherworld Envoy - Qi Bai, having insufficient spiritual intelligence, had been retracted by Ning Zhuo once again. With Ning Zhuo's Mother now awake, the combat power Qi Bai provided was no longer as valuable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Little Ma, are you alright?" Qing Chi shouted, then barked, "Qing-Jiao Army, annihilate this batch of Underworld Army cavalry!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Riding her Black Blood Paper Horse, wreathed in azure flames, she watched over Ning Zhuo with deep concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo knew she had misunderstood and quickly sent an explanation through his divine sense: "He's one of us, my informant. Much of the intelligence we've received came from him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Qing Chi's eyes widened as she scrutinized Sun Lingtong and his ox cavalry. Trusting Ning Zhuo completely, she immediately reversed her command without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong, his soul temporarily residing in a Paper Puppet, led over a dozen ox cavalrymen charging toward them. As the third wave to enter, they had ended up behind the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Noticing the Qing-Jiao Army's agitation, Sun Lingtong quickly restrained his ox, slowing his advance and maintaining distance. This subtle maneuver showcased his remarkable progress in horsemanship and his growing ability to command a cavalry squadron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After all, Sun Lingtong had been hiding within the Underworld Army for most of this time. In the Two Note Kingdom, he had remained concealed within the Mechanical Dragon, rarely participating personally. This time, however, he was not only joining the fray but also leading a squadron of ox cavalry, which had greatly deepened his understanding and honed his skills as a Military Strategist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Seeing the Qing-Jiao Army lower their guard, Sun Lingtong finally increased his speed, successfully merging with Ning Zhuo and the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">They faced away from the motionless Paper Person army, turning toward the approaching forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The first wave consisted of several Golden Core-level Ghost Generals. The second wave was a vast horde of Headless Ghost Riders. The third and final wave contained only one figure: the severely wounded Bone Tomb Daoist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Sun Lingtong, Qing Chi, and the others stood ready in battle formation. But Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin spoke up: "I'll handle this. Conserve your strength and rest. There's a more critical task that needs your attention."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Qing Chi noticed the Mechanical Puppet beside Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo) and couldn't help but ask curiously, "Eh? Little Ma, where did you get this Mechanical Puppet? It can actually talk like a real person!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong, however, clasped his hands in a respectful salute. "This junior pays his respects to Aunt!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were closer than blood brothers, and Sun Lingtong, being well-informed about the situation, naturally didn't dare to be presumptuous upon seeing Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin awaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Moreover, whenever Sun Lingtong looked at Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, he felt inexplicably weak, and there was a faint ache at the back of his head. He couldn't figure out why.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Qing Chi's curiosity was piqued by someone addressing a Mechanical Puppet so deferentially. "Little Ma, who is he? How do you know him? You're hiding so much from me," she said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo cleared his throat and evaded the question. "With the enemy closing in, I'll explain everything later."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin chuckled, her words carrying a profound meaning. "Later, there will be no need for explanations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">By now, the Ghost Generals had closed the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Paper Giant had been destroyed, and though this place held many mysteries, it was no longer the White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Ghost Generals, their lingering fear replaced by renewed killing intent, regained much of their morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Attack together! Slaughter them all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"This is the Underworld, our home turf!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"No, keep a few alive. They seem to know this place well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Several Golden Core-level Ghost Generals shouted loudly, their apparent conversation a deliberate attempt to intimidate Ning Zhuo and his companions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Seeing the enemy's fierce charge, Qing Chi gritted her teeth and shouted, "All troops, listen..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin reached out to stop her. "Listen to me, girl."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">In the next moment, she gently raised her long-handled scythe toward the charging Golden Core Ghost Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Ghost Generals continued their charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">?!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">But soon, they sensed something amiss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The legs running ahead seem strangely familiar..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Strange... why is my field of vision widening?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Why has the world suddenly flipped upside down?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Their ghostly bodies shattered like fragile porcelain - split in half horizontally or vertically, or their heads simply detached and fell to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Without even a scream, the Golden Core Ghost Generals perished, their ghostly forms dissipating, leaving only their Golden Cores floating in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Hiss...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In that instant, countless people gasped simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">How on earth did she do that?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Shock quickly gave way to terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Countless eyes focused on Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, her figure radiating shock, fervor, reverence, curiosity, and a myriad of other intense emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Behind the Ghost Generals, the Headless Cavalry erupted into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Even for these headless specters, the scene was unbearably terrifying!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">So many Ghost Generals, annihilated in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">What was even more horrifying was that these fierce Ghost Generals hadn't even managed a single move before being completely obliterated. A single, effortless strike from the enemy had wiped them out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">How could they possibly fight?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">How could they even continue?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Though headless, the Ghost Cavalry possessed intelligence and weren't incapable of thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">In the next moment, the charging cavalrymen abruptly scattered, fleeing in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's overwhelming might had frightened off most of the Headless Ghost Riders with a single move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Of course, a few stubborn fools continued their charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Meng Yaoyin murmured softly, "It's convenient when you all come to die together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Now, this is a bit troublesome."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">She shifted her stance, no longer standing upright but crouched slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">She rotated her wrist, holding the Great Serpent Scythe horizontally across her chest, its long handle parallel to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Her expression remained calm, her eyes devoid of joy or sorrow. Under the watchful gaze of the assembled masses, she made an imperceptibly gentle motion - like brushing dust from a scripture table - sweeping the bizarre scythe across the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Strange Path - its compassion was profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Silent and invisible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Where the scythe passed, space remained unbroken, without a sound, light, or shockwave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Yet the charge continued. The Ghost Cavalry closest to her froze instantly, riders and horses alike. In the next instant, their bodies disintegrated into dust, fluttering into the air and dispersing with the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">This sign rapidly spread, engulfing the entire Ghost Rider Legion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Regardless of their dispersion, speed, or protective measures, their fate remained the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">A deathly silence fell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Bone Tomb Daoist's pupils contracted to pinpoints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Where... where did this peerless fiend emerge from?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Why did Military Intelligence fail to detect this?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"With such a being, what hope is there of capturing White Paper Immortal City?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Run! Run! Run!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Bone Tomb Daoist was the farthest away. Seeing his side's overwhelming numbers, he had positioned himself near Ning Zhuo and the others, hoping to reap the rewards of their efforts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But the situation had changed too quickly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">With a single, swift strike, the entire cavalry battalion was annihilated. The previously fierce Ghost Generals were reduced to floating Ghost Path Golden Cores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin had single-handedly overturned the entire battlefield!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Already injured, the Bone Tomb Daoist turned and fled immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">In truth, even at his peak, he would never have dared to confront Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"So powerful! So powerful! Mother's combat strength is definitely Nascent Soul-level. Even ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't block her."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"No wonder..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo was deeply shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin straightened up again, holding her Great Serpent Scythe vertically, her gaze fixed on the fleeing Bone Tomb Daoist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Bone Tomb Daoist's speed was astonishing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">To Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi, he had already shrunk to a tiny dot on the horizon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">It was remarkable that, even with his injuries, he could flee so swiftly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Even the Bone Tomb Daoist was astonished by how effortlessly he had escaped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Just as everyone assumed Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin was too far away to reach him, and the Bone Tomb Daoist began to feel a flicker of relief, Meng Yaoyin raised the Great Serpent Scythe higher and slammed its pommel into the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">There was no sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Yet the swiftly fleeing Bone Tomb Daoist collapsed as if struck by a sudden, invisible blow. His eyes rolled back in his head, and he fell unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">His momentum carried him hundreds of paces across the Underworld's earth, his body tumbling relentlessly like a ragdoll. Only after a violent struggle did he finally come to a stop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The crowd: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Meng Yaoyin spoke softly, "Alright, go retrieve that Daoist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"U-understood," Qing Chi stammered. At her glance, her subordinate spurred their Mad Strategy Black Steed into a gallop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Through divine sense, Meng Yaoyin conveyed her thoughts gently, "Little Zhuo, I deliberately spared this Daoist's life for your use."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"There's a calamity upon you, involving the Soul Devouring Sect. A karmic debt must be settled."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"This is a Super Sect, possessing magic treasures that suppress Qi Luck. You mustn't underestimate them. The sooner you resolve this, the better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Otherwise, the clash of Qi Luck will lead to a covert, yet devastating mutual depletion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo quickly replied, "Mother, did you divine this? The Heaven and Earth Ghosts of the Soul Devouring Sect indeed hold a deep grudge against me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin nodded slightly, continuing to communicate telepathically with Ning Zhuo: "Use this captive to negotiate with the Soul Devouring Sect. Tell them that if they don't resolve this matter, you'll send this Daoist to the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"This alliance between the Soul Devouring Sect and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord to ambush the White Paper Immortal City and the Myriad Manifestations Sect has already escalated into a major friction between Super Sects."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"The Soul Devouring Sect doesn't fear you, but they do fear the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Moreover, this time, they truly broke the rules."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"If the Bone Tomb Daoist falls into the hands of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, it will provide both witness testimony and physical evidence, severely damaging the Soul Devouring Sect's position."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Therefore, this matter is of critical importance to them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Use this bargaining chip to negotiate with the Soul Devouring Sect. What you can achieve and how much you gain will depend entirely on your own efforts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo's spirits soared. "Understood!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He then stroked his chin, pondering. "So, there's a hidden mutual depletion of Qi Luck between entities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"The longevity of Super Sects stems from their possession of treasures that suppress Qi Luck."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"In that case, I'll do my best to avoid karmic entanglements with them in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin shook her head slightly. "This is precisely why it's important to treat others with kindness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"However, you needn't worry too much. The Buddha Heart Demon Seal on you also possesses the miraculous ability to suppress Qi Luck."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Take this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Having communicated through divine sense, Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin handed Ning Zhuo a collection of miscellaneous treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">These were all valuable items, but they were haphazardly gathered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">They had been scattered by the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Before the Paper Giant leaped into the black hole path, it casually scooped them up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Before leaving, my Inspiration touched these items, and I sensed something among them that is crucial for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"But I couldn't discern exactly what it is," Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin explained with concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo eagerly accepted the treasures, nodding vigorously with a charmingly obedient expression. "Mother, I'll cherish and protect these with utmost care."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Their conversation paused. Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin raised her head, her voice soft yet carrying throughout the hall: "Very well. From now on, everyone will follow my commands."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">No one objected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The hall fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Didn't you see Ning Zhuo obediently nodding?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The primary reason for this was the overwhelming combat prowess displayed by Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Everyone listened intently to her instructions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin lowered her head, focusing on her left hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">She continuously counted on her fingers, performing divinations. Soon, she made her arrangements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The assembled forces would split into two groups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">One group, led by her and the Paper Person army, would escort Sun Lingtong to Forgetful River Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The other group, consisting of the Qing-Jiao Army and Ning Zhuo, would charge toward the Sacrificial Altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"This plan has been brewing for years, leveraging the power of the Mystic Ink Scholar," Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin said, glancing at the Paper Person army behind her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">She sighed. "If we fail this time, the power of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord will surge, and he will inevitably invade White Paper Immortal City again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"When that happens, the Immortal Cities of the Living Realm will suffer untold horrors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"I have divined it: though the Sacrificial Altar is far from Forgetful River Immortal City, their secret connection remains strong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"To disrupt the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's grand scheme, we must attack on two fronts simultaneously and coordinate our efforts precisely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">She transmitted her thoughts telepathically, addressing only Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo worried, "Mother, according to your plan, we have to split up?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin nodded. "Trust me, this is the best arrangement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth and looked at Sun Lingtong. "Boss, I'm entrusting Mother to your care!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Sun Lingtong rolled his eyes. "Me? You're asking me to take care of Aunt?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin reassured him. "There's no need to worry. I've absorbed the spiritual energy from the Paper Giant, along with the baleful energy of countless fallen soldiers. This will be sufficient to sustain us through the coming battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"I've just divined that there's a secret method of communication between you two. What is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong exchanged a glance. The former said, "Mother, are you referring to the Divine Ability: Life Hanging by a Thread?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">After his explanation, Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin said approvingly, "Excellent, Little Zhuo. You've actually mastered this Divine Ability."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"And you've deliberately restrained its use, avoiding abuse. This shows remarkable self-discipline and moral character. I'm proud of you, my son."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">She counted on her fingers again, then suddenly turned serious. "You must maintain this good habit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"This habit will be of tremendous benefit to you in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Being praised by his mother, Ning Zhuo felt a genuine joy. "Mother, whenever I use the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, I always retract it immediately after use."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin cast a meaningful glance at Qing Chi. "Especially with her, you must remain steadfast in this practice."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
