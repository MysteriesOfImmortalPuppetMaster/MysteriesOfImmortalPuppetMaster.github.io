<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Southern Bean Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ten Thousand Medicines Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Father, you called for me?" Lin Shanshan asked as she entered the study, a hint of resentment in her voice. "I'm busy preparing for battle. If it weren't urgent..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">After Ning Zhuo left, he entrusted the Spirit Hidden Willow to the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, leaving Hua Guzi to care for the tree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Lin Shanshan and Hua Guzi's relationship had started off rocky, quickly spiraling into intense rivalry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Their clashes began in the training grounds, but as they sparred, a peculiar camaraderie blossomed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The two women became close friends, yet remained fierce rivals, locked in a love-hate dynamic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Driven by their competitive spirit, Lin Shanshan and Hua Guzi had both made remarkable progress in their cultivation, becoming the two most dazzling figures in the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect's training grounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Their win-loss records were nearly even, but in their last match, Lin Shanshan had narrowly lost to Hua Guzi. Determined to redeem herself, she had been training relentlessly, preparing for a rematch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Lin Bufan, her father, was well aware of this situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He couldn't help but feel pleased with this development. After all, his beloved daughter had shown remarkable diligence and rapid progress in her cultivation during their rivalry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Lin Bufan handed a letter to Lin Shanshan, and with a single sentence, he banished the resentful look from his daughter's face: "This is a letter from Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Ah! Ning Zhuo finally wrote to me?!" Lin Shanshan exclaimed, her face lighting up with joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Suppressing his irritation, Lin Bufan shook his head with a cold smile. "It's addressed to me. I just don't have the patience to explain it. Read it yourself first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Lin Shanshan immediately unleashed her divine sense, scanning the letter repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Her initial excitement faded, replaced by a hint of disappointment, though her tone remained cheerful. "I didn't realize Ning Zhuo had already reached the Flying Cloud Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"I wonder what strange customs they have there?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"How did he get so many Golden Cores? And all of them from the Ghost Path?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"These are valuable, Father! Many medicinal formulas require Ghost Path Golden Cores as ingredients."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Seeing his daughter defend Ning Zhuo only deepened Lin Bufan's irritation. He shook his head again. "Many formulas? Can you name ten?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Lin Shanshan rolled her eyes at him. "Father, why are you being so stubborn?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Ning Zhuo wants to reclaim the Spirit Hidden Willow and trade Ghost Path Golden Cores for it. This is a great opportunity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Even if Ghost Path Golden Cores aren't common medicinal ingredients, such a precious material is still exceedingly rare. We could buy it now and resell it later for a profit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Lin Bufan nodded slightly. "Your last point does make sense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Lin Shanshan's face lit up with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"The Spirit Hidden Willow has fully recovered. Ning Zhuo must have an important purpose for wanting it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"We need to secure it as soon as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"If you ask me, we should form a trade caravan, load up with Medicinal Pills, Spirit Stones, and the Spirit Hidden Willow, and set off for the Flying Cloud Kingdom immediately."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Father, the Spirit Hidden Willow is extremely rare and of vital importance. If something were to happen during a long journey, it would be disastrous. I can personally escort it, ensuring its safety every step of the way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Lin Bufan stared at Lin Shanshan, his gaze piercing through her pretense. "You just want to see Ning Zhuo, don't you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Lin Shanshan blushed slightly but stood her ground. "Ning Zhuo is my friend and our ally. Of course I miss my friend."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"I'm sure Eldest Brother misses him too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Father, don't you miss him too?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Lin Bufan shook his head. "My feelings can't possibly compare to yours."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">His brow furrowed. "Didn't I tell you? Ning Zhuo has already settled down in Two Note Kingdom. His wife is none other than Mu Lan, the sole heir to General Mu's Residence!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Lin Shanshan chuckled. "Father, you can keep up the act for a while, but I've already uncovered the truth about Thousand Peaks Forest. Ning Zhuo was forced into marriage with Mu Lan by a series of unfortunate circumstances."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Their marriage is a sham, not genuine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Lin Bufan tapped the table lightly with his knuckles. "And if it were real? I think they make a handsome couple."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Lin Shanshan's face darkened with displeasure. "Father, you're being unfair! If Mother were still alive..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The mention of his deceased wife caused Lin Bufan's expression to falter. Struck at his weak spot, he sighed heavily. "Alright, alright. You know I only want what's best for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Sigh... Take this letter and find Hua Guzi. Before leaving, Ning Zhuo arranged for her to care for the Spirit Hidden Willow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Alright," Lin Shanshan nodded, turning to leave, but paused. "Father, I want to join this trade caravan. You can't refuse me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Lin Bufan's heart stirred. He ventured, "Then what if I leave Hua Guzi behind and only let you join the caravan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Lin Shanshan froze, then gritted her teeth. "That... won't work! Hua Guzi and I are close friends. We agreed to compete fairly... she has to come too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">She forced a bitter smile. "If we move the Spirit Hidden Willow, we can't hide it from her. Knowing her temperament, if we truly exclude her, she might even betray us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Lin Bufan finally smiled, waving Lin Shanshan off. "Discuss it with her first. Forming a trade caravan isn't easy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Ning Zhuo mentioned in his letter that he's also using Ghost Path Golden Cores to trade with Zhu Xuanji. I'll send a letter to inquire about Zhu Xuanji's arrangements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, Southern Bean Zhu Clan, and Fire Persimmon Ning Clan had already forged a secret alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The caravan needed to traverse the Two Note Kingdom and the Northwind Kingdom to reach the Flying Cloud Kingdom, a journey fraught with peril and extreme difficulty. While it wasn't impossible for the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect to accomplish this alone, the cost would be immense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Under these circumstances, Lin Bufan naturally sought out Zhu Xuanji to inquire and discuss the possibility of cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">However, just as Sect Leader Lin finished writing his letter, he received one from Zhu Xuanji himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">It turned out that Ning Zhuo's letter had been relayed through postal stations across various regions until it reached the Southern Bean Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Southern Bean Kingdom was controlled by the Zhu Clan, so the distribution of such letters was naturally restricted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zhu Xuanji had received Ning Zhuo's letter a full day before Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Upon reading Zhu Xuanji's reply, Lin Bufan immediately understood his intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhu Xuanji had agreed to Ning Zhuo's proposal and would accompany the caravan to the Flying Cloud Kingdom, but he would not meet with Ning Zhuo directly. Instead, he instructed Lin Bufan to arrange a suitable representative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Lin Bufan couldn't help but feel puzzled. "Divine Constable Zhu is the Golden Core-level public face of our kingdom's royal family. What urgent mission requires him to personally intervene?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"With him escorting the trade caravan, I can finally rest easy," Lin Bufan thought, immediately penning a reply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Within half a day, the letter reached Zhu Xuanji's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Divine Constable Zhu extended his divine sense to read the message, his expression darkening with concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"I never expected Ning Zhuo to have already reached the Flying Cloud Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Sigh, I'm heading there myself. Fortunately, with the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect acting as our representative, I won't need to meet him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"It's best to maintain distance from the Child of Destiny."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">As for Lin Bufan's inquiry about why Zhu Xuanji was traveling to the Flying Cloud Kingdom, the constable could only maintain secrecy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"This is a covert operation secretly agreed upon long ago between our kingdom and the Flying Cloud Kingdom. I cannot disclose the details to Lin Bufan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Ning Zhuo is at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main headquarters, while I'm heading to Dragon Loach Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"We won't cross paths. There's no chance of us meeting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Southern Bean Royal Family had deliberated extensively before selecting Zhu Xuanji for this mission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhu Xuanji had long anticipated his selection. After all, a Nascent Soul-level cultivator entering another kingdom required a travel permit; otherwise, it would be considered an act of provocation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">However, this particular meeting between the Southern Bean Kingdom and the Flying Cloud Kingdom was not meant to be publicized. Therefore, obtaining a standard travel permit was impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Under these circumstances, Zhu Xuanji, as the strongest Golden Core cultivator without the restrictions of a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, posed no risk of escalating tensions between the two nations even if his presence were revealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">From this perspective alone, Zhu Xuanji was undoubtedly the ideal candidate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Two Note Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Capital City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">General Mu's Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Imperial decree arrives!" An envoy strode into the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"We receive the decree," Old General Mu declared, leading the assembled cultivators in kneeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The envoy slowly unfurled the scroll and began reading aloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Among the cultivators, Mu Lan's expression shifted to surprise halfway through the announcement. "What? I'm to be sent as an envoy to the Flying Cloud Kingdom?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">A thought struck her. "Hmm, this is a good opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Ning Zhuo sent a letter the day before yesterday requesting a trade for Ghost Path Golden Cores. I was just considering organizing a merchant caravan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Now that I'm going myself, it will save a lot of trouble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"I wonder, though, what the true purpose of this mission is?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Prime Minister's Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Kong Zhaoming was in his study, attending to official duties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Judging by his appearance, he was likely between forty-five and fifty years old. His square face featured sharp, angular features, slightly prominent brow bones, and eyes as deep and cold as a winter pond. His nose was straight and high, and his lips were pressed into a firm, unwavering line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Even seated, his tall, upright posture was evident, with broad shoulders and a sturdy back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He exuded an aura of restrained yet profound authority. Approaching him would instinctively cause one to straighten their spine, hold their breath, and focus their mind, daring not to commit the slightest impropriety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">His temples were lightly frosted with gray, and his long hair was meticulously bound by a simple, unadorned black crown - neither gold nor jade - leaving not a single strand out of place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He wore a plain, wide-sleeved robe of unadorned fabric, devoid of elaborate embroidery. Only the collar and cuffs were trimmed with meticulously woven black cloud or geometric patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">A dark jade belt, fastened with an ancient, square buckle, encircled his waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Like the man himself, his temperament was rigid, upright, and deeply rooted in tradition. He adhered strictly to the Rites, holding himself to the same exacting standards he demanded of others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Hmm?" He noticed a letter from his son, Kong Ran.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Someone wants to purchase a method for extracting Early Wisdom Innate Talent at a high price?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"This brat actually wants to agree?" Kong Zhaoming scoffed coldly, his displeasure evident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He mentally rebuked the idea: "With proper cultivation of Innate Talent, one can advance to master Divine Arts. Divine Arts are the standard for Nascent Soul-level cultivators. If a cultivator below that level masters them, they will inevitably possess the ability to challenge opponents far above their rank."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"The method for cultivating Innate Talent is of paramount importance - how could we lightly impart such knowledge?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"What if our enemies gain Nascent Soul-level combatants? What then?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Even if they don't reach Nascent Soul-level, any assistance to Golden Core cultivators is unacceptable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">In the current cultivation world, the Cultivation Nations are actively arming themselves, constantly facing off and guarding against each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Nascent Soul-level cultivators are restricted from freely entering and exiting the nations, but Golden Core cultivators are exempt from these controls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Therefore, even if a Golden Core cultivator obtains this method, it could potentially cause significant trouble for the entire nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"For example, our nation is currently holding secret talks with envoys from various nations on Dragon Loach Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Those attending are likely Golden Core-level cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"During these discussions, mutual sparring and competitions are inevitable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"In other words, the outcomes of Golden Core-level battles will determine our nation's prestige and influence subsequent negotiations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Kong Zhaoming, well-versed in the Rites, was the official responsible for organizing and hosting the secret envoys from various nations for the Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Kong Ran is my eighth son. Though he possesses early wisdom and innate talent, he is ultimately low-grade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"His flaw lies in his impatience and lack of perseverance. He never takes a steady, methodical approach, and his considerations are always incomplete."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"To sell his innate talent for a mere Intent Comprehension Brush? What kind of prodigal son would do such a thing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Absolutely not!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Green Stone Cave Abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo emerged from the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He stretched, and the stone-like skin covering his body peeled away in flakes, revealing his normal flesh beneath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">He glanced down at his arm. The symptoms of soul power suppressing his Physical Body had almost completely vanished. Only upon close inspection could faint shadows and dark spots still be detected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"However, this isn't solely due to the strengthening of my Physical Body's foundation. The weakening of my Soul also plays a role."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo had expended a significant amount of soul power when using the Intent Comprehension Brush earlier. He had deliberately refrained from intervening, allowing his Soul to recover naturally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">After stowing the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, Ning Zhuo resumed studying the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Progress was slow but steady.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Without other opportunities, Ning Zhuo could only continue to grind away diligently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">After a period of contemplation, the agreed-upon time arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo summoned Qing Chi and Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, resuming his instruction in talisman crafting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Time slipped by in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Seeing her reluctance to leave, Ning Zhuo had an idea. "Qing Chi, why don't you stay here and continue training with my Mechanical Puppets?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Qing Chi's face lit up with delight, and she nodded enthusiastically. "Yes, yes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo activated his Five Elements spiritual energy, linking the Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and the Snow Pivot Imperial Guard - Xie, and began sparring with Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Qing Chi was quickly overwhelmed and defeated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Each victory caused the Snow-Colored Maiden Hui to tilt her head slightly upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Qing Chi's combat prowess also improved rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The spiritual energy of the Snow Pivot Imperial Guard - Xie remained dormant. But Ning Zhuo had anticipated this and wasn't concerned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The sparring sessions also deepened Ning Zhuo's understanding of both Mechanisms, allowing him to control them with increasing skill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Gongsun Yan arrived to report the results of his investigation. He presented Ning Zhuo with a Jade Slip containing detailed information about Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"The Ban Clan... a renowned mechanical clan in the Flying Cloud Kingdom!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"Ban Ji possesses Golden Core-level mechanical constructs?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"He doesn't cultivate the Ban Clan's orthodox Method, but a Demonic Art..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"After my polite refusal, he intends to participate in Qing Huangzi's Flying Cloud Minor Trial?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">After reviewing the information, a faint smile curved Ning Zhuo's lips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Qing Huangzi was a Golden Core cultivator and one of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's foremost mechanical cultivators. He had organized the Flying Cloud Minor Trial, attracting cultivators from across the region.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ban Ji's involvement piqued Ning Zhuo's interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Given Ban Ji's relationship with Pi Fuhai, they are enemies, not allies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"I've reviewed his intelligence. Now, I'll confront him directly to verify the information and deepen my understanding."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
