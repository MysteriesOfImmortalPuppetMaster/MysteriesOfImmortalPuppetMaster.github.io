<paragraph index="1">Three days later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Nine Twists Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The morning mist had not yet fully dispersed, yet over a hundred cultivators had already gathered at the entrance of the Nine Twists Corridor Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Most eyes were focused on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">They transmitted their thoughts via divine sense, communicating secretly and incessantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">"Ning Zhuo is here again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">"He couldn't even pass the third twist last time, and it’s only been a few days. He dares to come back?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">"It is said that he has been frantically purchasing formation manuals, formation-breaking artifacts, and magic treasures these past few days. He spent millions of spirit stones alone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">"Hiss... with such financial power, there must be a super faction behind him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">"Hehe. In my opinion, Ning Zhuo is nothing special. Does he really think that just by throwing money around and having a few more formation-breaking artifacts and treasures, he can smoothly break through the Nine Twists Corridor Formation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">"Especially his behavior of buying formation manuals - it’s simply laughably naive! If one could pass the Preliminary Cloud Rising Trial just by making a last-minute effort like him, where would that leave the Myriad Manifestations Sect? Where would that leave us and the countless Flying Cloud Assemblies of the past?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">"Becoming famous at a young age and being valued by major figures like Zhong Dao and Tuoba Huang... it’s quite normal to be a bit frivolous and lack self-awareness. It doesn't matter; letting him bang his head until it bleeds and making a fool of himself will actually be quite beneficial for his future cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">The crowd did not think highly of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">Today, Ning Zhuo had changed into a plain, clean green robe. A storage bag hung at his waist, his expression was calm, and his gaze was clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">The duty cultivator at the entrance saw Ning Zhuo and a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes, but he quickly returned to normal, cupping his hands in greeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly: "Here to try again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">The duty cultivator disapproved internally but smiled, expressing anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">A flying carriage slowly descended, and Shen Xi also arrived at the scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">Today, he still wore a plain green straight gown, covered by a Black Silkworm Cloud-Patterned Cloak. His steps were leisurely, and his bearing was extraordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">Seeing Ning Zhuo, a flash of surprise passed through his eyes, followed by a smile: "Brother Ning, you are here too?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">Ning Zhuo cupped his fists to him, his smile radiating warmth: "Brother Shen, thanks to your guidance and the formation manuals you lent me, I came here to verify what I've learned."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">In his heart, Shen Xi felt Ning Zhuo was being somewhat rash. After all, each person only had three chances to attempt the Nine Twists Corridor Formation. Ning Zhuo had only taken a few days; his progress would be limited, yet he was using his second chance immediately. It seemed overly hasty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">However, in front of so many people, he could not openly dissuade him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">He wanted to send a divine sense transmission to warn Ning Zhuo that "the Dao of Formations is not so easily mastered," but after thinking about it, Shen Xi decided there was no need to be the bad guy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">"Let reality educate Ning Zhuo," Shen Xi decided silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">The entrance to the Nine Twists Corridor Formation slowly opened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">Seed candidates like Ning Zhuo and Shen Xi entered first; no one objected. The strong always received preferential treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">Lights and shadows shifted before the big-headed youth's eyes. When he opened them again, he saw the familiar vermilion pillars, carved beams, and blue-grey tiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">Ning Zhuo stood at the starting point of the First Twist and took a deep breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Last time, he had spent the time of one incense stick here just to find the pattern of the spiritual qi flow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">But this time - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">He closed his eyes, and his divine sense spread out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual was activated to its limit. Dozens of mechanical mirrors flew out from his sleeves, hovering in mid-air, refracting his divine sense at incredible angles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Almost instantly, the trajectory of the surrounding spiritual qi flow surfaced clearly in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">"Clear at a glance." Ning Zhuo opened his eyes, the corners of his mouth rising slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">He didn't wait for an incense stick of time like last time; instead, he stepped forward directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">One step to the left, two steps to the right, three steps forward, four steps back...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">His steps seemed chaotic, but each one landed on the gaps in the spiritual qi flow. The spiritual qi flowed past him without causing the slightest interference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">Thirty steps later, his body felt light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">First Twist, passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Time taken: Thirty breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">Several duty cultivators monitoring Ning Zhuo’s performance revealed looks of amazement upon seeing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">"He passed just like that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">"Such speed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">"It seems Ning Zhuo made ample preparations for this attempt. No wonder he was radiating confidence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">"Let's keep watching. He passed the First Twist before, so he has experience. Being this fast isn't that surprising."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">Second Twist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Forked paths appeared again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">Divine sense was suppressed to a radius of three zhang around his body, but Ning Zhuo showed no panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">He stood in place, closed his eyes, and spread his divine sense again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">The big-headed boy did not use the mechanical mirrors to forcibly expand his detection range this time. Instead, he condensed his divine sense into a thin thread, like a wandering filament, probing deep into the forked paths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">The Formation-Gap Roaming Shuttle glowed faintly in his palm, and the Five Elements Ban-Breaking Silk Ribbon fluttered gently, assisting his divine sense in penetration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Last time, he had used a brute-force running method, taking the time of a cup of tea to barely deduce the pattern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">But this time-</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Ning Zhuo opened his eyes, his gaze like lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">He suddenly stepped forward, walking into the first fork on the left, his movements firm and without the slightest hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Left, left, right, left, left, right, right, left, right...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">When he stepped past the seventeenth fork, his body felt light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Second Twist, passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Time taken: Half a cup of tea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Among the cultivators maintaining the Nine Twists Corridor Formation, someone witnessed Ning Zhuo's performance and couldn't help but let out a soft sound of surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">"Ning Zhuo indeed came prepared!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">"The magic treasures in his hands are excellent; they can assist in divine sense penetration."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">"It seems that after he went back, he figured out the Second Twist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">"Given his current reputation and status, asking some experts in formations for advice would easily get him pointers."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">Third Twist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">The same corridor, the same forked paths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">But this time, Ning Zhuo could not feel any formation fluctuations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Divine sense was suppressed to two zhang around his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Last time, he had been helpless here and could only withdraw dejectedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">But now - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">He extended his hand and drew in the empty air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">No formation base, no formation materials, no spirit stones, no physical items for setting up a formation. He simply used his fingers to lightly sketch in the air, consuming his own divine sense and spiritual energy to outline a miniature formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">He used this temporary formation specifically to probe the Third Twist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Ning Zhuo stopped and started, often pausing to slightly adjust the miniature formation in his palm. The formation constantly transmitted fluctuations, sometimes producing a strange glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Before long, when the strange light flickered for the seventh time, Ning Zhuo stopped and stood his ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">A gleam flashed in his eyes, and his heart shook slightly: "Caught it! It's right here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">He pushed his palm lightly, sending the miniature formation into mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Like a key, the strange light emitted by the miniature formation grew brighter and brighter, melting into the surrounding space and rippling out waves of spatial distortion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">Within the ripples, space was penetrated, and the scene of the Fourth Twist's corridor was revealed directly before Ning Zhuo’s eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Ning Zhuo strode forward, passing through this narrow spatial gate, breaking away from the Third Twist in one fell swoop and entering the Fourth Twist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">And the time taken for this was only slightly more than half a cup of tea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">Such a performance caused the observing duty cultivators to feel bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">"Ning Zhuo's attainments in the Dao of Formations are very deep; he can use formations to break formations. So why did he use clumsy trial-and-error methods in the Second Twist during the last trial, and become helpless at the Third Twist?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">There was a massive gap between Ning Zhuo's previous and current performance standards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">"Could it be that he really improved his strength this much in just a few days? Hehe, how is that possible!" The cultivator who voiced this guess laughed at himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Fourth Twist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">Ning Zhuo stepped into a new stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Divine sense was suppressed to one zhang around his body. The method of using formations to break formations was rendered ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">The difficulty of breaking through was much greater than the sum of the previous three twists.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">Ning Zhuo continuously mobilized various means to probe and sense, but all failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">"Interesting." Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment, then actually dispersed his divine sense, walking forward freely as if letting a horse roam where it pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">With every step he took, he was feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Feeling the blue bricks under his feet, feeling the texture of the corridor pillars, feeling the angle of the sunlight, feeling the direction of the breeze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">He walked and stopped, sometimes fast, sometimes slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Sometimes, he would stop in front of a pillar for a long time, reaching out to stroke the patterns on it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Sometimes, he would crouch down and carefully observe the moss on the blue bricks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Sometimes, he would raise his head and gaze at the sky outside the corridor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Whenever he felt something was wrong, he would stop to observe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Various clues and traces presented themselves one after another, then aggregated in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">A certain crack in a blue brick hinted at the direction of the formation lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">A certain shadow of a pillar hid a formation eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">The angle of the sunlight marked the operation time of the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">The direction of the breeze matched the flow path of certain magical energies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">"Found it." Ning Zhuo stopped under a certain pillar, reached out, and gently stroked the vermilion surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Mobilizing his divine sense and spiritual energy, he forcefully pried at a gap in the formation at the exact correct moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Then, in the next instant, space opened wide. Ning Zhuo stood in place, but he had already arrived at a deeper layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Fourth Twist, passed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">The cultivators on duty found it hard to believe, and many cried out in surprise simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">The commotion attracted more colleagues. Curious, the colleagues asked one after another what had happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">And those who witnessed Ning Zhuo break through the Fourth Twist from start to finish wore expressions of blank confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">"Ning Zhuo broke through the Fourth Twist!" these people continued to exclaim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Those asking didn't understand: "The Fourth Twist is the strictest stage, where traces of the formation's operation are concealed to the minimum. But relying on powerful formation-breaking magic treasures allows for a quick breakthrough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">"It's not like there haven't been people who broke the formation as quickly as Ning Zhuo in the past."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">The cultivators watching Ning Zhuo shook their heads or waved their hands: "No, you don't understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">"Ning Zhuo's method of breaking the formation was very special. No, to be more accurate... very ordinary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">"What do you mean?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">"He... just walked around and looked, then grasped a gap. At the most correct moment, with the most decisive strike, he pried open the gap and successfully sent himself into the next twist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">"Such technique was simply effortless, as if... as if he were a Grandmaster of formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Hearing this answer, the inquiring cultivators frowned: "How is that possible?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"He is so young; could he be a Master-level existence in the Dao of Formations?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Some supreme talents, who are stronger than geniuses, might possibly achieve it. But Ning Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"It's possible for Ning Zhuo too. He has only shown the standard of a first-rate genius so far, but with his subsequent performance, perhaps he can stand out and become the universally recognized supreme talent of this Flying Cloud Assembly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Even if he is a supreme talent, he can't be a Master of formations! The reason is simple: he majors in Mechanical Arts. His time and energy are invested in that field, so how could he have accumulated such depth in the Dao of Formations?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"But the problem is, Ning Zhuo's performance in breaking the formation this time was just like a true Formation Master. He seemed to rely on relevant intuition, keenly detecting every minute flaw. That final move to break the formation - concentrating spiritual energy without the slightest hesitation - his bearing was comparable to a Master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The crowd discussed animatedly, unable to figure it out, drawing even more cultivators into the debate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Let's keep watching. Won't his caliber in the Dao of Formations become clear?" This proposal won widespread approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">More than twenty cultivators managing the formation cast their burning gazes upon Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, was briefly reviewing his performance: "Relying solely on Master-level intuition indeed allows me to break the formation. However, this is also because I broke through three twists in a row earlier, gaining relevant accumulation and a significant understanding of the Nine Twists Corridor Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Relying on intuition to break formations requires a foundational prerequisite."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Next, I should practice using these formation-breaking treasures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Thus, in the Fifth Twist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo began to employ formation-breaking items in large quantities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">He first consumed a Revealing Talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The talisman turned into a golden light and submerged into the formation. A moment later, dozens of light points emerged, indicating the positions of formation eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">His fingers pinched and calculated rapidly, deducing the positions of the formation bases. Then he took out Formation-Fixing Stakes and nailed them into the formation bases one by one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">With each stake driven in, the operation of this corridor stalled a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">When the stagnation accumulated to a certain degree, revealing larger flaws in this twist of the corridor formation, Ning Zhuo decisively took out the Source-Severing Axe. With one chop, he directly severed the connection between the formation eye and the formation source!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">With a loud boom, the Fifth Twist corridor was broken, and Ning Zhuo stepped into the Sixth Twist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The observing cultivators looked at each other, unable to pinpoint Ning Zhuo's standard in the Dao of Formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The big-headed boy had indeed broken through the Fifth Twist quickly, but not by relying on intuition. Instead, he continuously used talismans, magic treasures, and so on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">After a long while, a cultivator spoke up: "It can be confirmed that Ning Zhuo's standard in formations far exceeds his first performance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"As for whether he is Master-level, it is hard to estimate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"His formation-breaking items are excellent; his heavy spending was not in vain. But his standard in formations is definitely not weak either, because using these formation-breaking items well is also established on a correct understanding of the formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"The Nine Twists Corridor Formation... starting from the Sixth Twist is the true difficulty, having stumped countless people. Let's watch further!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Ning Zhuo walked forward while using formation-breaking treasures to continuously probe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"Strange indeed." The big-headed boy revealed a look of doubt; his Master-level formation realm had also encountered a difficult problem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">At the same time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Shen Xi was facing the same difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">But his eyes shone with brilliance as he stared dead at a water basin in front of him. Ripples oscillated in the basin, shaking out patterns of formation lines. Each formation line flashed by in an instant, but Shen Xi became more excited the more he looked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">His spiritual energy was consumed drastically, and his divine sense plummeted like a waterfall. His eyes quickly filled with bloodshot veins as he muttered: "It really is like this, it really is like this! My days of bitter contemplation behind closed doors to excavate the mystery of this twist were not in vain!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Having obtained the correct answer, Shen Xi repeatedly took out rare formation-laying items and began to set up a formation within a formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">His technique in setting up formations was very skilled, though the steps were extremely cumbersome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">This action attracted the attention of the head cultivators, who praised him one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">"Shen Xi is indeed a disciple of the Shen family from Nine Palace Immortal City!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">"To set up a formation within a formation, the difficulty goes without saying. Shen Xi is only a Foundation Establishment cultivator, yet he can achieve this step; it is quite impressive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">"He wants to use a formation to break the formation; this is indeed a good prescription for cracking the Sixth Twist. But under such massive consumption, the subsequent twists will likely be hard to pass."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">"It's already not bad. He found the correct answer on his second trial!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">On the other side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Ning Zhuo suddenly stopped in his tracks. A spiritual light abruptly appeared in his divine sea: "I understand, it's time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">"In the corridor of this twist, the flow of time is sometimes fast, sometimes slow, and sometimes it even flows backward."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
