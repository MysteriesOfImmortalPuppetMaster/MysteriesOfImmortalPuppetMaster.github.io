<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 102: Yuan Dasheng vs. Meng Chong (Second Battle)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo's Bedroom</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The cultivation chamber was now fully constructed. Despite its small size and limited internal space, it was sufficient for Ning Zhuo's needs. Infused with spiritual energy, the Floating Cloud Handkerchief produced clouds of mist. These clouds filled the entire chamber, enveloping Ning Zhuo in a thick fog, where he couldn't see his own hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The double protection left the four Ning family guards powerless. They reported the situation to the young clan leader, Ning Xiaoren, who was unconcerned:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"What secrets could little Ning Zhuo possibly have? Our prior intelligence gathering has already uncovered everything about him. These young people think they still have some secrets. Let him have his delusions, it's quite amusing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">With this thought, Ning Xiaoren decided against ordering a deeper investigation. Being discovered by Ning Zhuo would harm the hard-earned goodwill and relationship he had cultivated. Ning Xiaoren didn't want to take such a risk. This reaction was within Ning Zhuo's expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">His vital energy flowed like small red rivers in his lower dantian, converging at the center. A small pool of vital blood had already formed there, resembling a miniature pond. As the vital energy continued to pour in, the pool suddenly trembled, expanding rapidly to three times its previous size.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He had broken through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">At this moment, Ning Zhuo reached the fourth level of the Essence Refinement stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Accumulated vital blood reaches its limit and increases fourfold. This substantial increase means the vital blood will form blood energy membranes more quickly, saving at least thirty percent of the previous time. Full operation allows for more than double the previous speed in digesting the medicinal power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo quickly grasped the improvements in various aspects. The most delightful surprise was the enhancement in medicinal absorption. Typically, the more advanced the cultivation, the slower the progress, and the Demonic Blood Vein Technique was no exception. However, with the increased speed of medicinal absorption, as long as resources were sufficient, he could maintain his previous rate of progress. This was particularly valuable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"The philosophy of the Three Sects' Masters seems to be 'change comes with the third.' Whether it's the mechanisms in the Lava Immortal Palace or the three cultivation techniques, passing the third level brings a qualitative leap."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo had deduced this pattern because the other two techniques had also recently broken through to new levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This was a natural progression. Previously, all three of his cultivation techniques had reached the peak of the third level, just a step away from the fourth level. After obtaining the subsequent techniques, Ning Zhuo spent a bit of time cultivating and quickly broke through his former limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique reached the fourth level, not only could it accumulate more Five Elements mana, but it could also be freely split and combined. Previously, Ning Zhuo had to concentrate to extract a specific type of mana to perform techniques like Ice Embrace and Fire Grasp. Now, with just a thought, he could easily separate a mixed stream of Five Elements mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Often, it's not a lack of practice but insufficient foundation. It's like a child who needs to jump to touch a windowsill. As they grow, they can reach it by standing on tiptoe. When fully grown, the windowsill is only waist-high, and they can touch it with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Among the three cultivation techniques, the progress in the Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique was the greatest, now reaching the fifth level. Ning Zhuo wasn't sure why this happened. When cultivating the later stages of the Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique, he progressed rapidly and naturally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo sensed that such swift progress in the Buddhist techniques might be related to him grasping the opportunity and obtaining the embryonic form of the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Buddhist techniques emphasize sudden enlightenment. Sometimes, one moment of enlightenment can equal a hundred years of hard work. The embryonic form of the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability I comprehended is closely linked with the Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"The Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique can communicate with all things with spirits. The Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability can forcibly control the target's every move. Coupled with the Heart Seal of my Buddha Heart Demon Seal, which influences thoughts and guides ideas..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo had glimpsed a rough outline of the Three Sects' Masters' methods of mechanism control. When the Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique broke through to the fourth level, it also achieved a qualitative leap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo discovered that the spiritual mirrors formed by the third-level divine sense could merge to create a larger spiritual mirror with a base. Although Ning Zhuo had no opportunity to practice or demonstrate it, he instinctively knew that this larger spiritual mirror's communing ability far surpassed the smaller mirrors from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"At least three times better!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Now, the Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique had reached the fifth level. Compared to the fourth level, the fifth level didn't bring a qualitative change but a quantitative one—the merged spiritual mirror gained an additional face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"What's this?" Ning Zhuo's heart skipped a beat. He sensed movement near the Golden Blood Battle Ape - Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Could it be..." Ning Zhuo immediately stopped the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, activated the Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique, and observed Yuan Dasheng through the large spiritual mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">As he suspected, it was Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Come on, come on, come on!" Meng Chong roared continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He charged recklessly, displaying unparalleled bravery, his puppet body entwined with crackling lightning shadows. In close combat, he was pushing Yuan Dasheng back step by step! Ning Zhuo was shocked and immediately used the Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique to commune with Yuan Dasheng's spirituality, manipulating the spiritual power within Yuan Dasheng to cast the Ice Embrace technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">One moment, Meng Chong was exuberantly roaring and fighting, the next he was engulfed by icy frost. His joints froze, drastically reducing his speed. Yuan Dasheng seized the opportunity to counterattack, his long fist like a spear thrusting directly at Meng Chong's chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Danger! Meng Chong knew his defense was extremely weak; if hit, he would surely lose. "Wild Thunder Sprint!" he roared in his heart. The lightning shadow around him suddenly expanded, transforming into intense electric light that enveloped his entire body. In the next instant, he shot out like lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Yuan Dasheng's fist hit nothing but air, stopping in its tracks, with his posture still facing Meng Chong. Meng Chong crouched in a corner, still shaken. He hadn't expected this mechanical monkey to be capable of casting spells! This revelation doubled the danger level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Failing to take me down with one strike means you've revealed your last trump card. Big monkey, today you are doomed!" Meng Chong regained his composure, his fear completely dissipating in just a few breaths. Once more, his fighting spirit surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The puppet Meng Chong charged again. The crackling lightning shadows accompanied his entire body, making each of his movements accelerate instantly. Yuan Dasheng engaged him in battle once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">However, Meng Chong's speed was far superior. After a few exchanges, Yuan Dasheng fell back into a passive position. This time, Ning Zhuo, observing from afar, saw everything clearly: "Meng Chong has improved again. This time, his mastery of the Wild Thunder Sprint has reached a new level. Although his speed hasn't surpassed his previous limits, his finesse has improved explosively."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">In terms of pure martial skills, Yuan Dasheng still surpassed Meng Chong. But Meng Chong's every movement was much faster than Yuan Dasheng's. As the saying goes, in martial arts, speed is the only unbreakable technique. In a real fight to the death, being a hair faster could be the difference between life and death. Meng Chong was much faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Yuan Dasheng could hold on for so long only because his martial skills had inherited his former expertise, allowing him to counter speed with technique, observing the start of movements to predict the opponent's next actions. "But Meng Chong, if this is all you've got, it's not enough," Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with a fierce light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Next moment... Fire Grasp! The hands of the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Yuan Dasheng, suddenly ignited, each forming a ball of fire. Yuan Dasheng tightly gripped the fireballs as if holding two spheres.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Next, Ning Zhuo silently recited in his heart:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Grasping the fireball like a heart of fire, with the mind and body dancing with strength to victory. Blazing armor rises fiercely, red glow flowing to protect the whole body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Building on the Fire Grasp technique, he cast another spell. Fire Grasp—Flame Bath!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the next moment, Yuan Dasheng lightly squeezed the fireballs, causing them to shatter into countless fiery sparks. The fire blooms, forming molten streams that rapidly flowed over Yuan Dasheng's entire body. Yuan Dasheng was now engulfed in flames, as if clad in fiery armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The flames roared, emitting intense heat. Meng Chong was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He gazed at the towering figure shrouded in roaring flames, then looked at his own wooden puppet body, finally fixing his gaze on the golden bones and red rocky muscles of the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Yuan Dasheng was unafraid of the flames, but Meng Chong could not withstand them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Yuan Dasheng stood still, only extending a finger towards Meng Chong, beckoning him as if to say: "Keep attacking, come and fight me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Dammit!" Meng Chong couldn't help but curse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Suppressing his anger, he gritted his teeth and charged in for another attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Moments later, Meng Chong was covered in flames, burnt into large chunks of charcoal that scattered all over the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
