<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“What? We are to withdraw our troops?” Zhao Xi, still lying on the stretcher, nearly sat up in shock upon hearing the news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He forced himself to hold back and remained lying down, but his eyes were wide open, with his pupils darting about in confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Since the start of the war, our army had maintained the advantage, and the enemy had already suffered a great collapse. This defeat was due to Du Tiechuan - twice he was assassinated by Young Master Sheng Xu; he was simply useless!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Zhao Xi clenched his fists in anger, gritting his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Even the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King did not enter the battle, yet our army still lost.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“My military achievements, my military achievements…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zhao Xi lamented inwardly, knowing that he would have a hard time explaining to the King upon returning because of this defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Previously, he had exercised his authority to supervise the military, seizing power on his own - taking advantage of Du Tiechuan’s power vacuum while he was recuperating, and he had indeed succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">But subsequently, his performance was not particularly outstanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Especially when the likes of Tian Shuang, Di Hui and others forcibly seized the spoils of war from deep underground on the battlefield. Afterwards, during the second grand battle, he voluntarily acted as a deserter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Although his performance was remarkably lifelike, how could it have deceived those with keen eyes?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“No, I must do everything in my power to save myself!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Military achievements - I need military achievements to save my life!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhao Xi’s own merits were obviously insufficient, but he had subordinates under him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">If a leader does not share the credit of his subordinates, is he still a leader?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhao Xi’s first thought was Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“This kid came from the Southern Bean Kingdom, and he deliberately enticed Xiang Yue just now to leave the battlefield. His hidden card was so strong that it could repel the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, Tian Shuang and Di Hui; how strange.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“He might actually be from South Bean Kingdom!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“I must have him come to the capital to report his merits, but that is obviously impossible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zhao Xi then thought of Mu Lan and immediately dismissed the idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Mu Lan’s general’s mansion had a far greater foundation than him, and Mu Lan had many battle achievements, all used to restore the family’s prestige.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">It was far too difficult for Zhao Xi to take credit from Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“The Three Generals Battalion!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">At this thought, Zhao Xi’s pupils dilated slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Hurry and go find Liu, Guan, and Zhang!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Our army is retreating; go find the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang, and tell them that in this battle they fought valiantly and performed outstandingly, and I will make full use of them! I will make full and heavy use of them!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Shuang Jing’s face was ashen, devoid of any color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“My White Jade Battalion is lost again…” He looked upon the chaotic battlefield, with corpses scattered everywhere, nearly brought to tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">In both of the two grand battles, they had twice been defeated by Lord Long. This time, it was even more brutal than the previous ambush. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The White Jade Battalion had fought to the death to protect Shuang Ling’s mortal body. Without the aid of “Gao Sheng’s Writings”, they could only painfully exchange time from Lord Long’s hands with the blood and flesh of their soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Beside Shuang Jing, Shuang Ling consoled him, “Don’t worry, you and I will return to the capital together after the battle; I will mediate for you. In this battle, you gained no merit, but you endured much hardship.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Shuang Jing felt a little comforted, but Shuang Ling’s mood was very low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In this battle, she had not reaped much merit either. Throughout the grand battle, apart from executing several Nascent Soul cultivators in the early stages, during the mid to late stages, she had been like a firefighting team, repeatedly repelling Xiang Yue, Lord Long, Lu Hongtu, and others, suffering the heaviest blows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Damn it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“If not for more than half of my assets being intercepted, I would have been able to exert more battle power and hold out longer; it would not have been impossible to suppress Lord Long and Xiang Yue!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">War is fundamentally a contest of resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The cultivation level of each practitioner was also accumulated from resources such as talent, time, and materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">What is the essence of cultivation? </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Essentially, it is simply a hundred different ways to convert excellent resources into power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In this regard, the art of mechanisms was particularly affected. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Because this skill could integrate multiple arts, combining techniques such as artifact refining, array formation, talisman crafting, and pill refining into one mechanical creation, and even further leverage it with military strategies, the resulting combat power was multiplied higher than any other art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Shuang Ling’s role in this battle was actually very important; if she had not personally taken the field, repeatedly holding off the wild attacks of Xiang Yue, Lord Long, and others, the main battalion of Two Note Nation might have collapsed first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">It would not be an exaggeration to say that Shuang Ling was the backbone of Two Note Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Du Tiechuan had endured for so long, and although he made a move that led to Lord Long’s death, in the end he still could not escape assassination by Young Master Sheng Xu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“And that dog Zhao Xi, clearly possessing the Festival Staff and supported by national techniques, yet unwilling to fight and fleeing at the last moment! When it comes to enjoying the spoils of war, he is always the first to act. Humph! Once we return to the capital, I will definitely give him a good thrashing!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Red Flower Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Although Du Tiechuan had issued the order to retreat, and it had already been conveyed to Mu Lan, the latter was in no hurry, and still ordered the entire army to remain in place for a full rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Zhang Zhongyi stood among the wounded, continuously using his healing arts to turn severe injuries into minor ones, and minor injuries into slight ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He quickly ran out of spiritual energy and, panting, stepped back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">But unlike before, the medical team of the Red Flower Battalion at this moment was no longer solitary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">A squad of cuckoo flower demons immediately entered among the wounded, continuing to cast spells, replacing Zhang Zhongyi and playing an important role.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Coincidentally, Mu Lan came over to inspect, and Zhang Zhongyi then exclaimed to the female general, “Ning Zhuo really did a great thing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“The squad of flower demons he purchased helped me a great deal, and also helped the Red Flower Battalion save many veterans and cure many new soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He held Ning Zhuo in high regard, and truly cared about Mu Lan as a junior; therefore, whenever he had the chance, he made every effort to bring Mu Lan and Ning Zhuo together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Although Mu Lan and Ning Zhuo had already become husband and wife, Zhang Zhongyi knew that there was not much genuine affection between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Mu Lan nodded, her brows slightly furrowing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Seeing her expression, Zhang Zhongyi immediately misunderstood and consoled her, “General Mu Lan, although our army is in retreat, we have twice caused the enemy to collapse in these consecutive grand battles. Moreover, with the Red Flower Battalion having repeatedly achieved merits before, there should be no problem restoring the General’s Mansion, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Mu Lan nodded, “Of course.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Upon the Red Flower Battalion’s return to the capital, Mu Lan gave a rather splendid response. She had achieved her pre-departure objective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yet, there remained much discontent lingering in the heart of this female general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“It is such a pity.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“If Du Tiechuan had not been stabbed, we would have still been the superior side, able to occupy this place and continuously attack the surroundings.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“At the very least, the Dragon King’s Giant Wood Mountain could have been captured!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“This military achievement was quite substantial…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">At the outset, Du Tiechuan had arranged a strategy, deliberately not attacking the Dragon King’s Giant Wood Mountain immediately, but instead relying on this strategic position to lure the allied forces of the Thousand Peak Forest into coming to its rescue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">After the second grand battle ended, miraculously, the Dragon King’s Giant Wood Mountain was preserved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhang Zhongyi then advised, “The Dragon King’s Giant Wood Mountain is right here; it won’t run away. At worst, we can continue attacking the Thousand Peak Forest next time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“In contrast, Ning Zhuo had family matters to attend to; after this battle, he probably would not stay for long.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"General Mu Lan, when the time calls for action, seize every moment to interact with Young Master Ning Zhuo. That's the essence of military strategy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Mu Lan glanced at Zhang Zhongyi, nodding sincerely, “You are absolutely right!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zhang Zhongyi felt greatly encouraged. It was evident that Mu Lan’s attitude toward Ning Zhuo had undergone a tremendous change compared to before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This could be seen from the fact that Mu Lan now referred to Ning Zhuo as “husband” at every turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Toward the end of the great battle, Ning Zhuo had already led Xiang Yue to leave the battlefield ahead of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Zhang Zhongyi learned the secret from Mu Lan, and was no longer worried about Ning Zhuo’s safety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Mu Lan expressed her view of Ning Zhuo, “Although I have restored the family’s prestige this time, my status is still awkward.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“It requires someone like Ning Zhuo, occupying the position of husband, to ward off external covetousness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“This young man is extraordinary; among the geniuses I have seen in my life, he is one of the very best.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Zhang Zhongyi, seeing how highly Mu Lan regarded Ning Zhuo, also became delighted, “Indeed, a person who can battle at the Foundation Establishment Stage with the Power of a Golden Core, and even decapitate Nascent Souls - how many years does it take for such a talent to appear?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“Moreover, he has fought shoulder to shoulder with you many times; this bond forged in battle is unmistakable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Mu Lan sighed, “I know; during the battle against the Cangyue Ancient God, if Ning Zhuo had not come to the rescue in time, the outcome for the Red Flower Battalion would have been grim.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“I also wish to spend more time with him and collaborate more deeply, but alas, our hurried farewell on the battlefield may well be the last time we see each other in the near future.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Zhang Zhongyi was greatly astonished, “Ah? Why is that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">This iron-skinned physician was very sentimental and often lacked strategic calculation, frequently misunderstanding the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Mu Lan then explained, “In the end, Ning Zhuo deliberately let Xiang Yue go; that much was obvious to anyone with eyes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Du Tiechuan was even more aware!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“Previously, when Ning Zhuo repelled Tian Shuang and Di Hui, everyone knew that he possessed a great treasures and a strong hidden card up his sleeve. At that time, Ning Zhuo did not dare to approach our main camp casually.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Now, he has let Xiang Yue go, and the latter was an extremely bountiful military achievement.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“This time, the main reason for the army’s withdrawal was that Du Tiechuan, being inattentive, fell victim to Young Master Sheng Xu’s assassination attempt. As the defeated general, when he returned to the capital, who knows how much blood would have to be shed?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“If he was able to present the head of Xiang Yue, it would be much easier to explain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">At this point, Mu Lan squinted her eyes, “Therefore, Ning Zhuo has now indeed made an enemy of Du Tiechuan. Since he has left the main army, he naturally will not return for the time being.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Upon hearing this, Zhang Zhongyi couldn’t help but open his mouth slightly, his expression filled with astonishment. Only then did he realize that it would be difficult to see Ning Zhuo again in the near future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">In the end, Zhang Zhongyi sighed, “I just saw Ning Zhuo’s figure disappearing into the towering mountains, and I didn’t have a chance to bid him farewell.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“Sigh, the affairs of the world are truly unpredictable. Who would have thought that in the end, Ning Zhuo would end up making an enemy with Du Tiechuan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The main battalion of Two Note Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Countless soldiers were cleaning up the battlefield, dismantling their camps and setting up fortifications.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ding Pi had died, but he had not completely perished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He was surrounded by enraged cultivators, his flesh turned to ash, but his Nascent Soul flitted through the void and escaped in a flash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">As for his disciple, that childlike cultivator, Jia Wan, was tied up with heavy ropes, completely sealed, and brought before Du Tiechuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Du Tiechuan sat on a low stool, surrounded by busy people on the ruined battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Having been stabbed, he looked pale, without a trace of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Upon seeing Jia Wan, Du Tiechuan frowned, “Both of you, master and disciple, already have a dubious reputation. Why were you willing to help the Thousand Peak Forest, taking such a huge risk?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Bah!” Jia Wan spat, “Our Jia family and Two Note Nation are mortal enemies!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Du Tiechuan suddenly realized, “So you are the remnants of Concubine Jia.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">This then involved an old palace affair, concerning Concubine Hu’s rise to power, Concubine Jia’s fall from favor and subsequent revenge, the counterattack and framing by forces related to Concubine Hu, and eventually the secret of a family’s ruin and downfall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Du Tiechuan then looked toward Lei Qingyang, “And how did you discern that these two were traitors?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Lei Qingyang then performed a bow, “Earlier, I went into battle and fought against the Blood Shadow Cave Master. During the fight, inexplicably, I was caught in a blood mist and was once suspended in mid-air.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“After this battle, the more I reviewed the situation, the more something felt off. There was no reason for me to have been hit by that move.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“That led to some other suspicions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Therefore, I refused the healing from others and focused on treating my own injuries, searching for clues in my wounds, and eventually discovered the truth.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“It turned out that the Qi within me was subtly changing, and had been captured by the Blood Shadow Cave Master even before he acted.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“I immediately understood that there was a traitor within the army, and we had been ambushed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“Afterwards, I quietly conducted further investigations. Until I saw Li Jiuqu glaring at Zhao Xi, causing him to bend over and vomit, spewing out a large amount of centipedes and maggots, and he suddenly came to his senses!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“At that time, Zhao Xi and Li Jiuqu were far apart, yet inexplicably, Zhao Xi was hit by some spell.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“This indicated that Zhao Xi’s Qi had long been captured by Li Jiuqu.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“And at the same time, the range of my and Zhao Xi’s potential ambush narrowed significantly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“I continued my investigation and eventually pinpointed the master-disciple pair of Ding Pi and Jia Wan. After all, both Zhao Xi, myself, and the other comrades had consumed a lot of spirit food before the battle, which had greatly enhanced our combat power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“Only unfortunately, it was a step too late - alas, just a little too late…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Lei Qingyang clenched his fists and sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Young Master Sheng Xu was able to carry out the second assassination attempt precisely by taking advantage of the chaos caused by the master-disciple pair Ding Pi and Jia Wan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Had Lei Qingyang exposed them earlier, he very likely would have directly suppressed Ding Pi and Jia Wan, and chaos would not have ensued; Young Master Sheng Xu might not have had a chance to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">And had that been accomplished, Lei Qingyang’s merits would have been enormous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Du Tiechuan listened expressionlessly, then nodded slightly, “Since things have come to this, there is no need to mention it further.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">His tone was flat, with only his slightly contracting fingers betraying the unrest in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Thousand Peak Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Poisoned Pool Giant Wood Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">This was one of Tu Ming’s old lairs, but it had already been washed into ruins, with corpses scattered everywhere and constant wails of despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Tu Ming, the mountain lord, had hidden himself deep underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Shen Qinghe hovered in the high air, her hand continuously emitting the clear and pure poisonous Dharma light. Under the radiance, the poisonous creatures covering the mountain cried out in pain, and the toxic gas gradually dispersed until it vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Even the vast Poisoned Flood Pool was gradually purified into a pool of clear water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Tu Ming felt his heart grow cold, “This ‘Qingling Pure Poison Scripture’ is truly terrifying. How could there be such a method in the world that counters poison techniques so effectively?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">After he joined the battle, he was marked by Shen Qinghe; after several exchanges, he was no match and had to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">That retreat directly caused him to be completely out of the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Shen Qinghe resolutely pursued the kill, chasing all the way to Poisoned Pool Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Tu Ming had initially been glad that one of his old lairs was nearby. However, the arrangements on the mountain were continuously shattered by Shen Qinghe, and his subordinates were repeatedly killed or injured by her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Even he himself dared only to hide, not daring to make any noise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">He had truly been countered too severely!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
