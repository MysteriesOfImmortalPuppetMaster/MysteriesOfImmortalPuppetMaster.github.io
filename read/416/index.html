<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Sun Lingtong was deeply shaken.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, his mind raced as he quickly reviewed everything that had just happened.<br/>
<br/>
"How did I end up falling into this petrification spell?"<br/>
<br/>
His hands were still turning to stone, and Sun Lingtong urgently examined them, confirming that this spell was exceptionally subtle, beyond his ability to fully comprehend.<br/>
<br/>
"This is a trap, deadly and merciless! Before me, who knows how many have already fallen victim to it."<br/>
<br/>
"No, that’s unlikely."<br/>
<br/>
"If that were the case, that group of hooded figures in black robes wouldn’t have been so bold, worshipping at the mountain and performing sacrifices, causing deaths so openly."<br/>
<br/>
"It’s clear that even the group of people didn’t dare enter the cavern, implicitly acknowledging that this godlike existence is still alive."<br/>
<br/>
"I personally inspected each of these materials after extracting and transporting them into the mechanical Dragon."<br/>
<br/>
"These precious materials must have been tampered with!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong analyzed the situation, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.<br/>
<br/>
The petrification spell continued eroding him, and his suppressed mana felt almost like drinking poison to quench thirst. As the spell came in contact with his mana, it only grew stronger.<br/>
<br/>
"No, I must inform Ning Zhuo of the situation immediately!"<br/>
<br/>
"We can’t lose track of those black-robed cultivators; I need to catch them and see what I can extract through severe interrogation."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong quickly began his self-rescue efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Controlling the mechanical Dragon, he immediately left the cave to pursue the departing black-robed cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, he also sent a flying message directly to Ning Zhuo’s room.<br/>
<br/>
After receiving a stern reprimand from Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo had returned to his quarters.<br/>
<br/>
Initially, he remained calm.<br/>
<br/>
Instinctively, he wanted to meditate and cultivate, but he remembered Sun Lingtong forbidding him to do so.<br/>
<br/>
So, he lay down on the bed, intending to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
But closing his eyes, he found himself unable to fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
In theory, given that he was still unhealed, with lingering aftereffects from his recent mishap and both body and mind exhausted, sleep should have come easily.<br/>
<br/>
Yet the reality was the opposite. Ning Zhuo tossed and turned, his eyes constantly moving under his lids.<br/>
<br/>
He took a deep breath, then opened his eyes suddenly.<br/>
<br/>
Staring blankly at the ceiling for a while, he grew agitated and sat up.<br/>
<br/>
After holding that position for only a short while, he rose and sat at the edge of the bed.<br/>
<br/>
After a few breaths, feeling like he was sitting on pins and needles, he had to stand up.<br/>
<br/>
Restlessness.<br/>
<br/>
Frustration.<br/>
<br/>
All sorts of negative emotions began to grow rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Linghu endured so many punishments in isolation, yet he managed to take it -truly remarkable!"<br/>
<br/>
"Elder Sun’s scolding was absolutely correct."<br/>
<br/>
"I can’t even endure a bit of idle time without feeling anxious, as though I'm wasting time."<br/>
<br/>
"My mindset has subtly changed in many ways since before."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt so uncomfortable; reason told him that cultivation and action required balance, but his emotions kept troubling him, making him pace back and forth in the room.<br/>
<br/>
Just then, he heard a knock on the door.<br/>
<br/>
Opening the door, Ning Zhuo saw a flying message slip float into his room, unfolding itself naturally in mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
"Why would Elder Sun be writing to me?"<br/>
<br/>
Curious, Ning Zhuo cast a glance at it.<br/>
<br/>
After reading it once, he understood the situation and his face changed: "Elder Sun is in trouble!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo snapped his fingers, igniting a small flame to burn the message slip.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately began writing a response.<br/>
<br/>
While the mechanical Dragon had a device that could transmit messages directly to Ning Zhuo’s quarters, Sun Lingtong was concerned that the dragon might also be turning to stone, so he had started minimizing its use.<br/>
<br/>
Worried for Ning Zhuo’s safety, he opted to use a flying message to inform him of the situation and instructed Ning Zhuo to burn it and avoid the storage bay and dragon’s head compartment, advising him to keep some distance from Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s reply soon reached Sun Lingtong’s hand.<br/>
<br/>
"At least Ning Zhuo is aware now," Sun Lingtong sighed in relief, quickly reading the response.<br/>
<br/>
In his reply, Ning Zhuo asked about Sun Lingtong’s injuries and suggested deciphering a message sent by the black-robed figures that Sun Lingtong had intercepted at the massive cavern.<br/>
<br/>
But in truth, Sun Lingtong had already started working on that.<br/>
<br/>
The message was soon decoded. In fact, it hadn’t even been encrypted by the sender.<br/>
<br/>
	To Stone-Old Demon:<br/>
<br/>
	We, the Six Caves Sect disciples, have been commanded by the Demon Heart Cavern Lord to deliver this letter, sincerely inviting you to awaken.<br/>
<br/>
	Our Six Caves Sect has long revered your great name, deeply admiring your earth-elemental powers, which shake the world. Now, with the imperial army encircling the Ten Thousand Peaks Forest, the situation is dire, and we urgently request your aid to unleash divine wrath and share in the joy of slaughter.<br/>
<br/>
	Should you consent, the Six Caves Sect will reward you generously!<br/>
<br/>
"So, they really are from the Six Caves Sect?" Sun Lingtong already knew of the Ning family’s grudge against the Six Caves Sect.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong focused on a specific line in the message: "As a member of the Six Caves Sect, the respectful yet equal tone toward Stone-Old Demon and the Demon Heart Cavern Lord…"<br/>
<br/>
"Could it be that Stone-Old Demon was initially a Nascent Soul cultivator, who attempted a breakthrough to a greater realm but failed, leaving him in his current state?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong gathered some critical information, but it was still far from complete.<br/>
<br/>
Under his control, the mechanical Dragon smoothly followed the Six Caves Sect emissaries.<br/>
<br/>
The emissaries quickly descended the mountain and retrieved their mounts —ferocious beasts resembling lions and tigers.<br/>
<br/>
Their faces were filled with worry, brows furrowed deeply, and they exchanged words rather than using spiritual sense as they discussed their options on the journey back.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, this diplomatic mission had ended in failure, placing immense pressure on them.<br/>
<br/>
Life hanging by a thread!<br/>
<br/>
During this time, Ning Zhuo intentionally used a spell to mark the four emissaries with a life-thread spell.<br/>
<br/>
The black-robed cultivators’ mounts moved quickly, soon reaching a base camp halfway up the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Through the teleportation array at the base, the four emissaries departed completely.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, a cultivator could only sigh when reaching this point in pursuit. But Sun Lingtong’s mechanical Dragon was different.<br/>
<br/>
This mechanical creation, at the Nascent Soul level, had the ability to travel through space like a Nascent Soul cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
All teleportation arrays, after all, operated on spatial transmission principles.<br/>
<br/>
So Sun Lingtong decisively guided the mechanical Dragon to dive into the void.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, it’s your turn!" Sun Lingtong communicated through the magical tool.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo responded with a laugh and immediately activated his divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
The upper Dantian —the Vajara Mirror.<br/>
<br/>
His full divine ability, appearing like a lotus with white stems, green leaves, and pink petals, instantly glowed brightly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo opened his mouth wide in surprise; though he could sense the four targets, the sensation in the void was entirely different from the real world.<br/>
<br/>
He felt a disorienting sense of reversal, distance distortion, even a dizzying whirl.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, he didn’t know how to describe it.<br/>
<br/>
The experience of traversing the void was too profound, far beyond his comprehension.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, he and Sun Lingtong had anticipated this; Ning Zhuo simply conveyed his sensory information to the mechanical Dragon, which could then navigate autonomously.<br/>
<br/>
A moment later, the darkness dispersed, and silver light expanded, transitioning back to the real world.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the dragon’s head compartment, Sun Lingtong steadied himself, shouting joyfully, "We did it, hahaha, Ning Zhuo, well done!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had collapsed to his knees, his entire body tingling, and the mirror of his spiritual consciousness almost shattered.<br/>
<br/>
Panting heavily, he felt dizzy and couldn’t move.<br/>
<br/>
The four black-robed cultivators stepped down from the teleportation array.<br/>
<br/>
Cautiously, Sun Lingtong controlled the mechanical Dragon, following the four robed cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Exiting the hall housing the teleportation array, he found himself outside.<br/>
<br/>
There, a forest of stone buildings rose upon the massive sky-pillar tree, mostly black and gray structures of varied height.<br/>
<br/>
A perennial cloud of purple-black poisonous fog obscured the sunlight above.<br/>
<br/>
The four black-robed cultivators wasted no time, ascending the main path quickly toward the peak.<br/>
<br/>
On the way, they encountered other Six Caves Sect disciples, most of whom wore black or gray robes and had cold or fierce expressions. Some had ferocious beasts like lions and tigers at their side, while others handled venomous scorpions or centipedes.<br/>
<br/>
From halfway up the mountain, Sun Lingtong observed a massive martial arena.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the arena, a large group of cultivators fought brutally, blood splattering as onlookers cheered enthusiastically. Occasionally, a cultivator would fall lifeless to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, competition within the Six Caves Sect was far harsher than in the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect!<br/>
<br/>
The four cultivators passed through the gates and stepped into the grand hall atop the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Guards stopped them, with one turning to report to the interior.<br/>
<br/>
Before long, the guards allowed them entry.<br/>
<br/>
The four black-robed cultivators exchanged glances and, steeling themselves, strode up the hall and entered the vast interior.<br/>
<br/>
The hall was vast, with a high dome and walls decorated with various murals. Some murals depicted monstrous mountains, poisonous waters, and evil fog; others illustrated fierce battles among cultivators, and some showed scenes of bloodthirsty rituals. All the figures in the murals shared one trait: whether crying or laughing, they wore fierce expressions.<br/>
<br/>
The floor was paved with black iron, cold and hard.<br/>
<br/>
A faint fragrance filled the air, tainted with a slight nauseating stench.<br/>
<br/>
At the center of the hall stood six black stone pillars, each uniquely shaped.<br/>
<br/>
Each pillar had a hollowed section with a seat or cloud bed carved into it.<br/>
<br/>
The four cultivators bowed deeply in the center of the six stone pillars.<br/>
<br/>
Three of the seats atop the pillars were empty; the remaining three were occupied by cultivators, either sitting or lying down.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these three possessed a powerful Nascent Soul aura and exhibited various mystical traits.<br/>
<br/>
One sat upon a throne, his large frame bare-chested and covered in black-purple scales, his eyes closed and motionless like a statue.<br/>
<br/>
Another sat cross-legged on a blood-drenched cloud, his form obscured by a bloody aura that pulsed like waves.<br/>
<br/>
The third lay on a cloud bed with her back to the hall. She wore a sheer purple gauze, her curves seductive, with a giant scorpion tail extending from her arm. The venomous sting glowed ominously.<br/>
<br/>
The four cultivators bowed in reverence.<br/>
<br/>
Through their conversation, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo quickly deduced the identities of the three Nascent Soul cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
The tall man covered in scales was the Demon Heart Cavern Lord.<br/>
<br/>
The one shrouded in bloody light was the Blood Shadow Cavern Lord.<br/>
<br/>
The seductive woman lying down with a scorpion tail was the Scorpion Venom Cavern Lord.<br/>
<br/>
The Demon Heart Cavern Lord opened his eyes, which, having undergone secret cultivation techniques, lacked normal pupils and held only a swirl of blood-red mist that rotated continuously.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing their report, the Demon Heart Cavern Lord spoke in a deep voice: "You sacrificed over a dozen Qi Refining disciples, yet you failed to even meet Stone-Old Demon. Incompetent fools, die."<br/>
<br/>
The four cultivators had just begun to plead when—<br/>
<br/>
Bang, bang, bang.<br/>
<br/>
Their chests exploded in succession, and four hearts flew out.<br/>
<br/>
The fresh hearts floated before the Demon Heart Cavern Lord, and the scales in the center of his chest parted to reveal a narrow, hand-sized slit.<br/>
<br/>
The slit opened, revealing a blood-red heart, its black veins twisted like dragon roots, densely tangled.<br/>
<br/>
Each heartbeat triggered the explosion of a heart in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
The essence released by each heart explosion flowed into the chest slit, consumed by the Demon Heart Cavern Lord.<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Shadow Cavern Lord let out a cold laugh, and a part of his bloody aura split off, covering the four bodies.<br/>
<br/>
The four corpses shriveled at a visible rate, as their entire blood essence was absorbed by the Blood Shadow Cavern Lord.<br/>
<br/>
The Scorpion Venom Cavern Lord slightly moved her scorpion tail, flicking a cold light through the air.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the desiccated corpses transformed into four pools of purple venom.<br/>
<br/>
The venom quickly turned into a purple mist, gathering on the scorpion tail.<br/>
<br/>
The Scorpion Venom Cavern Lord laughed, "With war looming, here we are slaughtering our own sect members, cultivating demonic arts. If the Great Cavern Lord returns and finds a hundred or so cultivators missing, he’ll surely fly into a rage. Hehehe."<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Shadow Cavern Lord snickered coldly, "The imperial vanguard has already drawn close to Ten Thousand Peaks Forest, with additional forces following. Even if the Great Cavern Lord gets angry, what can he do? A few Foundation Establishment cultivators are nothing compared to our Nascent Soul might."<br/>
<br/>
The Demon Heart Cavern Lord spoke in a low voice, "They couldn’t even summon Stone-Old Demon. These worthless souls serve no purpose other than to nourish our cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
"At this critical moment, even a sliver of cultivation power could be the difference between life and death."<br/>
<br/>
The Scorpion Venom Cavern Lord chuckled, "Hahaha, that Stone-Old Demon is an ancient earth spirit who loves tranquility and is as old as time itself. Summoning it was always going to be challenging. You’ve used this method to eliminate quite a few of our sect’s rising stars. I think it’s time to slow down. After all, without those pawns, would we have to take the field ourselves in the early stages of battle?"<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Shadow Cavern Lord sneered, "You speak so nobly, Scorpion. But the truth is, you’ve hit a bottleneck in cultivating your venomous arts and need time to refine your venom, isn’t that right?"<br/>
<br/>
"Afraid we’d surpass you if we keep cultivating at this pace?"<br/>
<br/>
The Scorpion Venom Cavern Lord, her motives exposed, laughed without a care, "And so what if you’ve seen through me?"<br/>
<br/>
"My venom arts require the freshest emotions, particularly the fear, terror, shock, and anger just before death—perfect ingredients for venom refinement."<br/>
<br/>
"Why not take a brief pause, just for a while?"<br/>
<br/>
"These Foundation Establishment cultivators’ hearts and blood essence help you two little, not worth worrying about."<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Shadow Cavern Lord snorted, "As leaders of the Six Caves Sect, we naturally help each other. But what’s your offer?"<br/>
<br/>
The Scorpion Venom Cavern Lord flicked her scorpion tail, tossing out two items.<br/>
<br/>
One was a fist-sized Blood Fiend Stone; the other was a segment of a mechanical carriage.<br/>
<br/>
"A Nascent Soul-grade Blood Fiend Stone, not bad, not bad," the Blood Shadow Cavern Lord said, storing the stone with satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
The Demon Heart Cavern Lord, however, frowned, "Scorpion, you’re trying to appease me with just a mechanical carriage of mere artifact level? Are you taunting me, insulting me?"<br/>
<br/>
The Scorpion Venom Cavern Lord laughed, "How could little sister dare? Demon Heart Brother, take a closer look; this carriage may appear to be an artifact, but in fact, it’s of spiritual treasure grade, only cleverly disguised."<br/>
<br/>
"When we plotted against the Ning family, we seized a large cache of their valuables. Everyone overlooked this carriage, treating it as an artifact, and it was handed out as a reward."<br/>
<br/>
"One day, I happened to discover the unique qualities of this carriage and arranged to have it taken from its previous owner."<br/>
<br/>
"Demon Heart Brother, isn’t your son, Lin You, always scheming for a White-Tusk Mammoth?"<br/>
<br/>
"That’s troubling."<br/>
<br/>
"The new mammoth king is highly protective, and with the enemy advancing, we need to rally the White-Tusk herd."<br/>
<br/>
"Lin You just wants a mount to show off. With a few modifications, this carriage should satisfy him."<br/>
<br/>
Only then did the Demon Heart Cavern Lord smile, reaching to take the carriage.<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, lately, Youer has indeed been quite a handful."<br/>
<br/>
"Scorpion, much appreciated."<br/>
<br/>
The Scorpion Venom Cavern Lord laughed sweetly, "As long as Brother is pleased."<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Shadow Cavern Lord sneered, "Scorpion, you’ve spent a pittance for a big win. Impressive, impressive."<br/>
<br/>
Inside the mechanical Dragon, Ning Zhuo trembled with anger!<br/>
<br/>
He recognized the carriage as the one his mother had described, the one she had traveled in while expecting him.<br/>
<br/>
"Could it be that Mother went into labor because this carriage was stolen, forcing her on a long journey?"<br/>
<br/>
"Scorpion Venom, Demon Heart…!"<br/>
<br/>
"Six Caves Sect!"<br/>
<br/>
"I swear I will reclaim that mechanical carriage!"<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo vowed this, the Demon Heart Cavern Lord’s expression suddenly changed.<br/>
<br/>
This Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator spoke, "Something’s wrong."<br/>
<br/>
"What is it?" the Blood Shadow Cavern Lord asked.<br/>
<br/>
The Scorpion Venom Cavern Lord laughed, "Brother, if you’re dissatisfied, I can add a little something extra."<br/>
<br/>
But the Demon Heart Cavern Lord’s face turned grave as he slowly shook his head, "After consuming those hearts, I sense an unusual presence, something foreign mixed in."<br/>
<br/>
With that, he quickly cast a spell.<br/>
<br/>
Dark energy spread through the hall, conducting a powerful search.<br/>
<br/>
Finding nothing, the Demon Heart Cavern Lord activated another spell.<br/>
<br/>
The demonic energy surged like waves, shaking the entire hall.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the dragon’s head compartment, Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth, sweating with tension.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo’s mechanism ring suddenly tightened.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo reflexively cried out.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Ning Zhuo’s voice, Sun Lingtong jolted, his body moving before his mind caught up, as he immediately ordered the mechanical Dragon to dash outside the hall.<br/>
<br/>
Bang!<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, the hall doors slammed shut.<br/>
<br/>
The Demon Heart Cavern Lord laughed maniacally, his aura surging as he slowly rose like a towering giant.<br/>
<br/>
The red mist in his eye sockets swirled faster, and his gaze locked onto the mechanical Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha, how bold, to spy on the Six Caves Sect!"<br/>
<br/>
With a booming pulse of his demonic heart, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong spat blood within the mechanical Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
At the brink of life and death, the mechanical Dragon plunged into the void.<br/>
<br/>
But the Blood Shadow Cavern Lord’s bloody light followed closely, striking the dragon, rapidly staining its body red.<br/>
<br/>
"Escape, escape, escape!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s every hair stood on end; his mind was filled with only one thought.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo’s heart nearly burst as he collapsed, falling unconscious.</div>
