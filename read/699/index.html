<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"We won!" Su Lingkou cheered excitedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"This Mechanical Puppet's combat power is incredible!" Shen Xi thought, deeply shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Having observed the entire battle, he knew the Tiger Demon was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, his combat prowess far surpassing that of ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">In his true form as a ferocious tiger, his physical attributes were superhuman. Though his Magic Artifacts were somewhat lacking, falling short of his cultivation level and combat capabilities, this was understandable given his status as a rogue cultivator and Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This was the golden age of Cultivation, a world dominated by humans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The two Demonic Talismans Pi Fujie had bestowed upon the Tiger Demon amplified his combat power by at least five times its original level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Thousand-Layer Scale Skin Talisman functioned as an exceptional defensive magic treasure. The Blood-Burning Surge Talisman granted the Tiger Demon wings, dramatically increasing his speed. This speed enhancement wasn't limited to footwork; it encompassed every aspect of his movements - punches, turns, and even the circulation of Qi within his body - providing a comprehensive boost to his agility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Shen and Pi Clans were mortal enemies, and Shen Xi was intimately familiar with the power of the Seven Talisman Demonic Skin Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">From the start of the battle, Shen Xi had been apprehensive, specifically warning Ning Zhuo about this. When he saw the Tiger Demon, empowered by the two Demonic Talismans, push Snow-Colored Lady Hui into a disadvantageous position, he wasn't surprised in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"But in the end, the Tiger Demon was completely suppressed by this Mechanical Puppet!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Shen Xi marveled inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The final freeze had fully revealed Snow-Colored Lady Hui's overwhelming combat power - genuine Golden Core-level strength!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Shen Xi couldn't help but wonder, "Which faction is backing Ning Zhuo? How did they leave him with a Golden Core-level Mechanical Puppet?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He then pondered which factions in the Flying Cloud Kingdom specialized in mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Is it the Ban Clan? The Xuanji Sword Sect? The Hall of the Compass? Or perhaps Weaving Cloud Loom City?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Pi Fujie's face was as dark as water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He stared intently at Snow-Colored Lady Hui, who stood with her head raised, and painfully realized that if he were to fight her himself, he would be locked in a bitter struggle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Fortunately, this person's control over mechanisms is lacking. The early stages of the battle flowed smoothly, but when the Tiger Demon used two Demonic Talismans, he panicked and made critical mistakes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Even so... this Mechanical Puppet is not to be underestimated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Damn it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Pi Fujie gritted his teeth inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Although he believed that Ning Zhuo, as the puppet's controller, was the weakest link and would be his primary target in any future conflict, he couldn't deny that Ning Zhuo was a formidable enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo retracted Snow-Colored Lady Hui but remained in the arena, turning to Pi Fujie outside the arena. "Come on. Your subordinate is dead. Now it's your turn."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo issued another aggressive challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Pi Fujie's eyes flickered, his fighting spirit plummeting further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">In his view, Ning Zhuo hadn't personally engaged in combat, clearly lacking expertise in controlling mechanical puppets. He was obviously using Snow-Colored Lady Hui as a disposable pawn to probe the enemy's capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">In truth, Pi Fujie had the same intention. He had sent the Tiger Demon into battle to gauge Ning Zhuo's true strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The result was disastrous: the Tiger Demon was no match for Snow-Colored Lady Hui and was slain outright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Pi Fujie knew in his heart that the Tiger Demon's failure wasn't due to its own weakness, but rather because the enemy's mechanical puppet was simply too powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">If I accept the challenge, I'll have to deal with this mechanical puppet first. It will be a grueling battle, exposing my weaknesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Even if I win, how will I then confront this big-headed cultivator?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">A wise man knows when to retreat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">With this thought, Pi Fujie sneered coldly. "I refuse your challenge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo burst into laughter, his voice ringing with mockery. "Is this the Pi Clan's family tradition? Are you the Foundation Establishment's face for the clan? You're a disgrace to your family!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Don't worry, I'll make sure everyone knows about your cowardice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Pi Fujie shook his head, his face turning ashen, but his refusal remained firm. "A true man knows when to yield and when to strike, when to advance and when to retreat. Spread whatever lies you wish. The Pi Clan's prestige cannot be shaken by mere rumors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo wasn't surprised when Pi Fujie refused to accept the challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He had already grasped Pi Fujie's temperament and deliberately projected an overwhelming aura to make him retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo turned to Shen Xi. "Brother Shen, this Tiger Demon bears two Demonic Talismans from the Pi Clan. I'll gift him to you. Studying these talismans will undoubtedly reveal the secrets of the Seven Talisman Demonic Skin Sutra."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Pi Fujie remained unshaken, his confidence unwavering. "Dismantle them all you want. If the mysteries of my clan's cultivation art could be so easily deciphered, the Pi Clan would never have endured for so long!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">With that, he turned and left abruptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Having already lost one round, what was the point of staying? To endure further verbal humiliation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Shen Xi and Ning Zhuo could only watch him go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After all, this was the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main headquarters. Everyone seeking to join this super sect naturally had to abide by its rules.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The sect rules governed disputes between cultivators, requiring them to be settled through martial sparring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">But Pi Fujie refused to accept the challenge, disregarding his reputation. Ning Zhuo couldn't force the issue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">As Pi Fujie stormed out of the Martial Training Hall, his spiritual energy surged like a tempest, radiating a murderous aura that warned all to keep their distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">With the Tiger Demon dead and Ning Zhuo's overwhelming display of power, he could at least report back to his clan with some semblance of dignity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">But losing the first round meant that losing the second would be disastrous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Next, he needed to find a way to regain the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"My clan supports me, giving me an advantage over Shen Xi. After all, I have more subordinates."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"But I never expected Shen Xi to forge such a strong alliance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Facing two opponents alone puts me at a disadvantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Think he's the only one who can make connections?" Pi Fujie sneered. "If Shen Xi can befriend experts, why can't I?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"This time, the Ban Clan's talented juniors have also come to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect. The Ban Clan has always coveted exceptional mechanical constructs, especially Ban Ji, who's notoriously greedy and obsessed with collecting powerful machines..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Pi Fujie began plotting his counterattack. Meanwhile, in the Martial Arena, Ning Zhuo once again offered the Tiger Demon's corpse to Shen Xi, making it clear this wasn't just empty courtesy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Shen Xi waved his hand, clasped his fist in a respectful salute, and replied, "Many thanks, Brother Ning, but this is your hard-earned trophy. How could I possibly accept it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Driven by ulterior motives, Shen Xi refused the Tiger Demon's corpse. Since Ning Zhuo had already made an enemy of Pi Fujie, accepting the gift would only complicate matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Tiger Demon was merely at the Foundation Establishment Stage, of little real value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">If he accepted it, the nature of this Martial Arena duel would shift. Instead of being a personal feud between Ning Zhuo and Pi Fujie, it would become Ning Zhuo acting on behalf of Shen Xi and the Shen Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Pi Fujie's voluntary retreat revealed his apprehension toward Ning Zhuo. Should Ning Zhuo later publicize Shen Xi's acceptance of the Tiger Demon's corpse, Pi Fujie would likely seize the opportunity to gracefully back down, abandoning his pursuit of Ning Zhuo and focusing solely on Shen Xi and his group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">This was the established custom of the Righteous Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Shen Xi continued his explanation: "Brother Ning may not be aware, but Pi Fujie's earlier remarks held some truth. The Shen and Pi Clans have been enemies for generations, with countless casualties on both sides. Our clan has collected no small number of corpses of Pi Clan cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"We have long studied the Seven Talisman Demonic Skin Sutra. While the Tiger Demon's corpse could indeed offer insights into the Sutra's secrets, it holds no further value for our clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Brother Ning, I urge you to examine it. With your exceptional comprehension and scholarly knowledge, you are sure to gain enlightenment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yet these explanations alone were insufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">As befitting a genius from a prominent clan who had received elite-level education since childhood, Shen Xi produced a Jade Slip: "Brother Ning has shown interest in the Nine Palaces Formation. Though our acquaintance is brief, we have formed a deep bond. Since Brother Ning has stood up for my friend today, allow me to present you with these Academy Notes. I implore you not to refuse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A subtle glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he immediately discerned Shen Xi's underlying intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He promptly praised the Shen Clan's mastery of the Nine Palaces Formation, affirmed the bond between himself and Shen Xi, and finally accepted the Jade Slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">With this matter settled, both Shen Xi and Ning Zhuo felt their friendship had deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Shen Xi invited Ning Zhuo to accompany him in observing the martial performances of others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This had originally been Ning Zhuo's purpose in coming here, but the encounter with Pi Fujie had been an unexpected turn of events. Even more surprising was Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's performance in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This disrupted Ning Zhuo's original plans, so he politely declined Shen Xi's invitation, explaining that he couldn't wait to delve into the Academy Notes Shen Xi had gifted him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Shen Xi naturally wouldn't force Ning Zhuo to stay and could only bid him a reluctant farewell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">As Ning Zhuo departed, Su Lingkou voiced her concern: "Cousin, by giving Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo the Academy Notes, aren't you revealing the Shen Clan's arcane knowledge of array formations?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Shen Xi smiled faintly. "Naturally, there are some unique insights belonging solely to the Shen Clan, but not many."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Don't worry, cousin. I considered this carefully before offering the notes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Ning Zhuo could have shown some restraint and avoided this battle. I would never have retreated, and I made my intention to fight to the death clear from the start."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Yet he insisted on intervening, demonstrating his sincerity in wanting to get closer to me through his actions. How could I possibly avoid him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Shen Xi's gaze turned somber. "To express my gratitude, I must show my own sincerity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"I don't know the extent of Ning Zhuo's backing, but judging by this battle, it must be considerable, with deep reserves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Therefore, the only foolproof approach is to offer him something he undoubtedly lacks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Right now, the Academy Notes are the most suitable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"With the Shen Clan's unique insights into the Nine Palaces Formation, once Ning Zhuo studies them, he'll inevitably crave more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Su Lingkou clapped her hands in admiration. "I see now, Cousin! This is our bait!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Shen Xi laughed heartily. "Exactly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Among the ten classic static formations, the Nine Palaces Formation is particularly complex. My Academy Notes contain three years' worth of records. For someone without family teachings, it would take even longer to master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Su Lingkou smiled. "Cousin, I can already picture Ning Zhuo eagerly holding his Academy Notes, begging you for guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Shen Xi burst into another hearty laugh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Returning to his rented cave abode, Ning Zhuo immediately released Snow-Colored Lady Hui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Divine Art: Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He unleashed his most potent control technique, forcefully connecting to Snow-Colored Lady Hui's spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Simultaneously, he extended both hands, the fingertips of his ten fingers emitting Five Elements Suspension Threads that connected to the Mechanical Puppet's body joints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Snow-Colored Lady Hui immediately struggled, but failed to break free.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Through Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo instantly sensed her impatience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">A sharp glint flashed deep within Ning Zhuo's eyes as he made his assessment: "She's unresponsive to Life Hanging by a Thread and resists external control."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Her spiritual energy has indeed reached the Spirit-Motion Stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Having studied On Spiritual Nature, Ning Zhuo knew that spiritual energy was divided into four major stages: the Dead Spirit Stage, Living Spirit Stage, Intelligent Spirit Stage, and Divine Spirit Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Each major stage was further divided into five minor stages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Previously, both Snow-Colored Lady Hui and Snow Pivot Lord Xie had reached the Spirit Primate stage of the Living Spirit Stage, their spiritual energy fully matured and endlessly self-sustaining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Beyond the Spirit Primate stage lies the Spirit-Motion Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">At this stage, spiritual energy manifests distinct and intense emotions, acting independently and breaking free from the cultivator's control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo already had experience with this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Yuan Dasheng had fallen into this stage. He had left the city and sat vigil at his Old Master's Secret Burial Ground for two days and a night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"In this stage, one must follow the spiritual energy's emotions, not forcibly control it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"By stroking its fur the right way, I can earn its loyalty and truly master it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Despite this understanding, Ning Zhuo harbored deep anxiety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">After all, Ning Xiaohui had died because of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo had no choice at the time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">It was either her life or his.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's spiritual energy originates from Ning Xiaohui. Normally, spiritual energy shouldn't retain memories from its previous life. But Yuan Dasheng remembered his Old Master's Secret Burial Ground... Could Ning Xiaohui still see me as her enemy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">It was precisely because of these concerns that Ning Zhuo had previously limited his control to the Mechanical Component, the Floating Ice White Jade Hand, rather than the entire Mechanical Puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Therefore, when Ning Xiaohui began exhibiting signs of the Spirit-Motion Stage, Ning Zhuo, burdened by worry, immediately left the Martial Training Hall to return and assess the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Life Hanging by a Thread is a Divine Art. She couldn't resist it, nor even detect it. Her emotions show no murderous intent or hatred toward me, but she is clearly impatient with my control."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The reality wasn't as dire as Ning Zhuo had feared, allowing him to breathe a sigh of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Since she's impatient, I should reduce my control during this sensitive period, perhaps even grant her temporary complete freedom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"But how can I satisfy her emotions?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">He possessed three major Mechanical Puppets: the Buddha Physician, Meng Yaoyin, and Meng Yehu. However, their spiritual energy had already surpassed the Spirit-Motion Stage from the start. Only Yuan Dasheng's case offered valuable reference material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Yuan Dasheng had personally sought out his Old Master's Secret Burial Ground to vent his grief and longing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Yuan Dasheng's initiative was remarkably strong, but when applied to Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, she remained utterly still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo retracted the Five Elements Suspension Threads, leaving only the Life Hanging by a Thread secretly controlling her. Yet the Mechanical Puppet remained motionless in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Thoughts surged through Ning Zhuo's divine sea: "There's a clear pattern here. Yuan Dasheng's loyalty to his Old Master, rooted in his very nature, fueled his intense grief and longing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"What was Ning Xiaohui's temperament like in life?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Gradually, Ning Zhuo found his answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The battle against the Tiger Demon flashed before his eyes. The memory froze on the moment the Tiger Demon was frozen to death, capturing Snow-Colored Lady Hui's proud, slightly upturned gaze as she moved freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">This image served as powerful confirmation of Ning Zhuo's conclusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Breaking free from his thoughts, Ning Zhuo surveyed his surroundings. "I need to rent a new cave dwelling."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
