<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Worldly Aspect Smoke and Clouds..." A sharp glint flashed through Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He knew what this was: a special type of cloud qi formed only under specific celestial phenomena, created when the qi of the "red dust" - the mortal world - surged upward from a region to pierce the sky, eventually forming this smoke and cloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Because it could simulate the myriad aspects of the world, this type of smoke was often used in setting up illusion formations, or harvested to create illusory realms for sect disciples to temper their mental states.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Yun Niaoniao stood beside Ning Zhuo, gazing at the cloud sphere and sighing with emotion. "In the past, although the Demon Subjugation Hall would use Worldly Aspect Smoke and Clouds, they have never done so on such a scale. As I see it, the Demon Subjugation Hall's massive upgrade is largely thanks to you, Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Yun Niaoniao, known as the "Little Bodhisattva," was an outstanding newcomer who had emerged during the first trial of the Demon Subjugation Hall and had caught the eye of Zhong Dao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">After seeing Ning Zhuo, she took the initiative to approach and strike up a conversation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo also knew of Yun Niaoniao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He had vowed to take first place in this second trial of the Demon Subjugation Hall. Although he had ample confidence, he would never underestimate his opponents. Therefore, he had gathered intelligence on all significant competitors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Among these key rivals, Yun Niaoniao was one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo let his thoughts wander and chatted idly, "There is a rumor that if a cultivator can gather the smoke and clouds of the thirty-six fundamental worldly aspects, such as the 'Seven Emotions Aspect,' 'Six Desires Aspect,' and 'Life and Death Aspect,' they can refine a unique 'Red Dust Creation Furnace.' I wonder if Fellow Daoist Yun Niaoniao has heard of this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Yun Niaoniao smiled faintly, her bright eyes fixed on Ning Zhuo. Because Ning Zhuo exuded an awe-inspiring righteous qi that seemed to pierce the clouds, she held a very favorable impression of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Yun Niaoniao spoke straightforwardly, "Fellow Daoist Ning need not use my full name. I am confident that I can join the Demon Subjugation Hall. So, in the future, we shall be fellow disciples within the same sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Fellow Daoist Ning can address me directly by my name; calling me Niaoniao will suffice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">She paused, then continued, "I have heard this rumor as well. It is said that the 'Red Dust Creation Furnace' can simulate a small world within itself, with living beings reproducing and civilizations rising and falling, nearly akin to world creation. However, the amount of smoke and clouds required is colossal, beyond the capacity of any single sect or region to gather. Furthermore, the Heavenly Dao would likely not tolerate such a heaven-defying object."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Therefore, throughout history, there are almost no clear records of any mighty cultivator successfully refining the 'Red Dust Creation Furnace.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Compared to that, I actually agree more with another perspective."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"A certain Nascent Soul True Lord proposed that Worldly Aspect Smoke and Clouds might be Heaven's method of record-keeping. The myriad events of the human world are but scenes in a play to the Heavens, and the smoke and clouds are the 'backup of the drama.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Yun Niaoniao came from an extraordinary background; she was from a medical clan with profound resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">She was also a first-rate genius, only slightly inferior to the likes of Situ Xing, placing her in the second tier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This did not mean she wasn't excellent. On the contrary, being able to reach the second tier in the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Flying Cloud Assembly was proof enough that her cultivation talent was national-class!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It was just that the people superior to her were almost all concentrated right here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Like Ning Zhuo beside her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He is a genius who surpasses me! Yun Niaoniao held this perception as she actively sought to get close to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Demon Subjugation Second Trial, open."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Participants - enter the Marsh!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Just then, the cultivator presiding over the formation called out loudly. Accompanied by this voice, the entrance to the grand formation opened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Let us go together, Fellow Daoist Niaoniao." Ning Zhuo followed her advice readily, changing his form of address decisively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Yun Niaoniao smiled and walked side by side with Ning Zhuo, stepping into the grand formation along with the flow of people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Acting together, the two naturally attracted many gazes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Of course, the vast majority of eyes were focused on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"That is Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Truly a striking talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"To be able to exude such astonishing righteous qi... as long as he matures, he will inevitably become a pillar of our Righteous Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"I'm afraid the top spot in this second trial of the Demon Subjugation Hall will belong to him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Unlike before, the expectations of bystanders for Ning Zhuo were significantly higher. As soon as Ning Zhuo appeared, even though he only had a cultivation base at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, he was widely favored by the public, who believed he was extremely likely to seize first place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo had long anticipated this situation; it brought both pressure and motivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Moving with the crowd, he entered the grand formation and stepped onto the smoke and clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">A sensation of floating unsteadiness came from the soles of his feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo walked in the company of Yun Niaoniao, but after only a dozen steps, the surrounding smoke and clouds became increasingly dense, turning into a vast whiteness that obscured his vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo felt a slight startle in his heart; in a trance, he lost his sense of Yun Niaoniao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">After taking a few more steps forward, his footing suddenly became solid. All the clouds and mist before his eyes abruptly dissipated, making Ning Zhuo's vision instantly clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The sky was not a normal color but was shrouded in a layer of dark red fog. The fog was as thick as plasma, churning and writhing, blotting out the sun, moon, and stars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Shrouded in the blood mist was a village, silent as death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo looked around, then inspected himself internally, before finally focusing his gaze on the village directly ahead. He praised inwardly, Flesh and body entering the dream. Truly the environment of the Cloud Dream Marsh. Interesting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Cloud Dream Marsh was a special terrain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Living beings who set foot in it could physically enter dreams. Sometimes the dream was singular; other times, it was complex and ever-changing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Demon Subjugation Hall's investment in the second trial was massive, consuming a vast amount of Worldly Aspect Smoke and Clouds to artificially create a patch of Cloud Dream Marsh for the cultivators' trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The cost of this Cloud Dream Marsh was staggering, yet it was only temporary. The wealth and boldness of the Myriad Manifestations Sect were evident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo did not find Yun Niaoniao, nor was he surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">It seems the person controlling the formation wants to test each cultivator individually.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Since the scene before him was set up this way, the Demon Subjugation Hall naturally had its intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo used his divine sense and magical power to capture a wisp of blood mist and examined it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This blood mist can trigger agitation in blood and qi, causing restless emotions, and subsequently causing living beings to fall into a state of frenzied madness. It must be caused by some kind of demonic art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Interesting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Regardless of what the scene before me is testing, this blood mist alone allows me to verify my 'Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art' from a different angle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Full of interest, Ning Zhuo stepped into the village.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The village was dead silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">On both sides of the dirt road were crooked thatched cottages with mud walls. Every household had its doors and windows tightly shut; some window lattices still bore fresh bloody handprints. Scattered on the road were broken farming tools, overturned baskets, and sporadic bloodstains. Further away, several carcasses of livestock lay dead by the ridges of the fields, their bodies shriveled as if their essence blood had been drained dry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Hhh... Hhh..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The broken door of a thatched cottage on the right was violently smashed open. A villager with bloodshot eyes and drool dripping from the corner of his mouth roared and lunged out! This villager was dressed in rags, the exposed skin covered in protruding dark green blood vessels. Looking like a mad demon, his fingers formed claws, aiming straight for Ning Zhuo's throat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">At the same time, the same scene appeared for every cultivator participating in the trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">One cultivator saw a villager lunging at him and shouted sternly, "Get lost!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He swept his sleeve, directly knocking the villager flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">But immediately following that, attracted by the commotion, three or four more frenzied villagers lunged out from behind houses and alley corners.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The cultivator was annoyed. "Mere mortals, seeking death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He shifted his hands, his palm wind sharp as a knife. Bang, bang - two sounds rang out as he directly caved in the chests of the rushing villagers, sending them flying back while spurting blood. After hitting the ground and twitching a few times, they stopped moving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The cultivator held back slightly on the last strike, leaving one alive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Just as he was about to attempt an interrogation, the corpses of the villagers killed by his palm wind suddenly absorbed the thick blood mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Wisps of blood-colored mist drilled into their mouths and noses. Within three breaths, the two corpses actually stood up again. The depressions in their chests were filled and bulged out by the blood mist, the red light in their eyes intensified, and they roared, lunging once more!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The cultivator's expression changed slightly. He struck again, shattering the skull of every villager.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">But the blood mist could still "repair" the corpses; it just took a bit longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The sounds of fighting and the scent of blood attracted more villagers. In just a moment, villagers surged forth endlessly like a tide, surrounding the cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Their movements were stiff, their strength great; they knew no pain and advanced wave upon wave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The cultivator had a Golden Core cultivation base, so self-preservation was not an issue, but his expression grew increasingly ugly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">It wasn't that he hadn't thought of using spells for large-scale attacks to clear the field quickly, but he found that the power of his spells was suppressed to a very low level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The cultivator also discovered that while these frenzied villagers posed no threat to his life regardless of their individual strength, their endless numbers were extremely annoying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He attempted to leave the village, but always ended up walking back inside. Clearly, this scenario was meant to confine the cultivator within the village.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The cultivator was enraged. He used martial arts to slaughter continuously, creating a river of blood while attempting to explore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">When he explored an ancestral hall in the village, a white-haired old woman suddenly rushed out from the side. Her eyes were bloodshot as she tremblingly swung a cane to strike him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The cultivator did not notice the subtle difference, treating her as just an ordinary villager, and ended the old woman with a single palm strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">As a result, in the next moment, he was teleported out of the formation and received the message that he had been eliminated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Cultivator: "?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The old woman also swung at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Hm? This person seems different from the other villagers." A sharp glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes, and he decisively reached out to restrain the old woman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Carrying the old woman, Ning Zhuo stepped onto the roof, buying time for research through constant jumping and movement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The old woman was sealed by Ning Zhuo's magical power, motionless like a stone statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo probed with his divine sense and immediately discovered that the extent of the blood mist's erosion on the old woman was shallow, unlike the other villagers - she could still be saved!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo formed his fingers into a sword and repeatedly struck acupoints all over the old woman's body. Combining his divine sense and magical power, he helped her suppress the blood qi within her body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Within the blood mist, the blood qi of the infected was chaotic and conflicted, but Ning Zhuo had diligently cultivated the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art and was very knowledgeable about this. Especially during the process of crafting the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, he had deepened his understanding of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art by weaving this cultivation technique into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Therefore, very quickly, the redness in the old woman's eyes receded like a tide, revealing a pair of bewildered and pained eyes. She opened her mouth as if to say something, but no sound came out; her body went limp, and she fainted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">At the same time, the dark green blood vessels under her skin clearly faded a few shades, and her breathing rapidly stabilized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Success, as expected." Ning Zhuo felt a slight joy in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The change in the old woman was within his expectations. The joy in his heart was not about this, but rather: The technique of demonic contamination can be used not only to harm people but also to save them. It shows that so-called demonic arts are essentially just tools. Used righteously, they are righteous; used perversely, they are perverse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Used to punish evil, it is a brutal invasion. Used to promote good, it acts with mercy, carefully regulating the human body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Next, Ning Zhuo decisively changed his strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">He moved through the crowd like a butterfly threading through flowers, acting each time to save the villagers who "still had a breath of life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Ning Zhuo became more adept at saving them as he went. After he had rescued twenty-eight villagers, smoke and clouds rose around him again. In a momentary trance, the village and blood mist were completely covered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">At the same time, a divine sense transmission informed Ning Zhuo that he had successfully passed this stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Many cultivators in the Demon Subjugation Hall were observing Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"He passed the first stage, as expected."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">"I told you, he would definitely have no problem!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">"Ning Zhuo has a steady temperament. He endured the influence of the blood mist's agitation and accurately identified the 'special' villagers. His attitude towards mortals has always been amiable; he truly deserves his reputation for a righteous heart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">When cultivators practiced for a long time, they often developed arrogance, harboring contempt and disdain for mortals deep in their hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Many cultivators who were eliminated in the first stage failed not just because of carelessness or impatience, but because the arrogance deep in their hearts made it difficult for them to treat every mortal with patience. Especially when these mortals were actively seeking death and constantly offending them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Ning Zhuo did not rush to step forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">He quickly reviewed the first stage in his mind, feeling a bit of lingering fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">That was a bit dangerous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">If I hadn't been focused on studying the blood mist, keeping my divine sense projecting around me at all times, it would have been difficult to judge the differences between the crazed villagers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">If I had just blindly acted tough and killed indiscriminately, I'm afraid I would have been eliminated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">A thoughtful light flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes. So, what this stage was testing was the cultivator's ability to observe in detail? Methods to clear the blood mist?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Perhaps... the key point lies in the cultivator's mindset.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">Only after having this realization did Ning Zhuo take a step forward, entering the second stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">The smoke and clouds before his eyes dissipated, and Ning Zhuo found himself inside a dungeon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">The dungeon was damp and cold. Dark green moss crawled over the stone walls, rotting straw was piled in the corners, and the air was filled with a mixture of rust and mold. Dim oil lamps were embedded in the walls every few zhang, their flames flickering and stretching human shadows into distorted, swaying shapes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">Ning Zhuo observed his surroundings. Understanding nothing yet, he decided to follow the corridor forward to continue his reconnaissance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">After walking a dozen steps, Ning Zhuo heard the sound of footsteps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Subsequently, a cultivator slowly walked out from the opposite corridor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">This person was tall and thin, appearing to be around thirty years old, yet his temples were already gray. Particularly striking were his snow-white long eyebrows, the ends of which drooped down to his cheekbones, gleaming with a cold luster under the dim lamplight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">His face was gaunt, his features deep as if carved by a knife, and his eye sockets were slightly sunken. However, his eyes were </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">startlingly bright, his gaze sharp as an eagle's, revealing a sediment of weathered experience and a trace of lingering, solitary gloom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He wore washed-out dark blue sturdy clothing, and at his waist hung a sheathless black iron long sword. The blade was dull and lightless, yet faintly surrounded by the scent of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"White-Eyed Hero... Gu Huaijiu." The name flashed through Ning Zhuo's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">He had looked through the participant briefs gathered by the Demon Subjugation Hall before the trial and had a deep impression of this person - the orphan of a wiped-out family in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, who specialized in killing fallen officials and evil cultivators. He was praised by the common folk but wanted by the kingdom. In the previous first trial, Gu Huaijiu had walked with considerable steadiness in the Heavy Karma Swamp and was a major competitor for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">According to intelligence, ever since this person met with the drastic change in his life, he has been unsmiling and filled with bitterness and deep hatred. Just as the intelligence said... Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">In the next moment, however, a smile appeared on Gu Huaijiu's face, and he took the initiative to bow with hands clasped in a Daoist greeting. "So it is Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo. I, Gu Huaijiu, offer my greetings."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
