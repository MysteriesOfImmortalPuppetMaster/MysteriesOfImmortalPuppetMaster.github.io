<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In response to Sun Lingtong's proposal, Zeng Jide slowly shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Inadvisable," he said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"My mission here is merely to pilfer some rare materials from the Forgetful River—a opportunistic strike to gain a small advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"The Painted Skin Rakshasa, however, aims to obstruct the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Dao Path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Even if we helped her escape to cover our own tracks, it would still be unwise. The Prefecture Lord would likely see us as accomplices."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Interfering with his Dao Path would undoubtedly incur his undying enmity—a grudge he might never relinquish in this lifetime!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zeng Jide transmitted his thoughts telepathically, his words carrying weight. "As the Void Sect, a major sect that primarily engages in theft, we're not afraid of offending a prefecture or even a nation. But such actions must promise substantial gains."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Based solely on what we stand to gain, is it worth provoking the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord to the point of mortal enmity? It's too great a risk for such a meager reward."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lingtong thought to himself, As expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zeng Jide's reaction was exactly as he had anticipated. Had he pressed the matter earlier, they likely would have parted ways by now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Little Zhuo is the Son of Destiny nurtured by the Living Realm's Heaven—the greatest Human Tribulation the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord will ever face."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Old Zeng, by helping me, you're also helping Little Zhuo. Whether we succeed or fail, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord will see you as one of us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zeng Jide remained blissfully unaware, reluctant to offend the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord—yet he had already crossed him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">This wasn't entirely his fault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong was merely at the Foundation Establishment stage. Zeng Jide never imagined two fledgling Foundation Establishment cultivators would be audacious enough to obstruct the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's Dao Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">It was like ants provoking an elephant—what difference did it make?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong frowned deeply, deliberately feigning difficulty. "But if we don't use the Painted Skin Rakshasa, how will we escape this place?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zeng Jide assumed Sun Lingtong was worried about his own life. Through his divine sense, he teased, "Kid, are you scared now? Where's the reckless courage you had when you stormed the Forgetful Crossing without a clue?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"I won't help the Painted Skin Rakshasa."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"That woman is a cruel Demonic Cultivator who delights in torturing innocents and harvesting their skins for treasures. Especially when she uses human skin to create her Painted Skin, she inflicts every possible torment, saturating the skin with terror and resentment to make her creations lifelike."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"I despise that woman!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Come to think of it, Forgetful River Immortal City actually encourages virtue, giving Soul and Ghost Cultivators a chance to start anew and reinvent themselves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Compared to the Painted Skin Rakshasa, I have a much greater fondness for Forgetful River Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Void Sect wasn't a Demonic Path sect, but a Heretical Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Members of Heretical Sects often straddle the line between right and wrong, existing somewhere between the Righteous Path and the Demonic Path, unbound by conventional constraints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Let nature take its course... let nature take its course..." Sun Lingtong reminded himself inwardly, while outwardly feigning realization. "So that's how it is. This Demonic Cultivator is so cruel—what if we rescue her and she repays our kindness with betrayal, attacking us first?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zeng Jide, who continued to meditate with his eyes closed, reassured him, "Don't worry. Since I brought you here undetected, I can get us out the same way!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"I was merely grazed by that Golden Token earlier, sustaining a serious injury."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Once I've recovered and regained my strength, leaving here safely will be no problem!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Sun Lingtong's curiosity piqued. "Golden Token? What's that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Zeng Jide patiently explained, "It's one of the National Artifacts—a consumable item, used once and gone. Clearly, we triggered a trap set by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, causing one of these Golden Tokens to fly out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"The national power contained within this is extraordinary. Fortunately, no one was here to oversee it... If the True Form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had been here and acted personally, I fear I would have been struck dead in an instant!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Zeng Jide spoke with lingering fear, showing no hesitation in revealing his distress before his junior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Alright, let's discuss any issues after we leave this place and reach safety."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zeng Jide focused entirely on recuperating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun Lingtong secretly fretted but could do nothing but "let nature take its course" and obediently follow orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">After resting for half an incense stick's time, Zeng Jide slowly opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His injuries had largely healed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Sigh, I still had to use a Soul Formation-level Medicinal Pill." Zeng Jide was only at the Nascent Soul stage; without access to higher-level healing elixirs, such rapid recovery would have been impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">During this time, countless thoughts had raced through Sun Lingtong's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Several times, he nearly couldn't resist the urge to act himself, to destroy the Formation and release the Painted Skin Rakshasa.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">But in the end, he held back, choosing to trust the words of Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, who had cared for him: Let nature take its course!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zeng Jide rose from his seated position, once again lifting Sun Lingtong with one hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Theft Path Method: Shadow Escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The old man and the youth transformed into a black shadow, flowing out of the Formation Space like water and returning to the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The City Lord's Mansion remained heavily guarded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But Zeng Jide had recovered much of his strength and was no longer as vulnerable as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">True to his word, moments later, he successfully led Sun Lingtong out of the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The two appeared in an alleyway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong had already stopped pinning his hopes on Zeng Jide. "Perhaps I'll need to act alone from now on. Old Zeng isn't crucial to our next steps."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Naturally unaware of Sun Lingtong's true thoughts, Zeng Jide said smugly, "Well? Young man, I didn't deceive you, did I?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Sun Lingtong immediately gave Zeng Jide a thumbs-up and showered him with flattery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zeng Jide laughed heartily, his eyes gleaming shrewdly. "You're not being entirely sincere, boy. Your praise is superficial and a bit perfunctory."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong chuckled. "I truly admire your methods, Senior. But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"But what?" Zeng Jide pressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong scratched his head. "But... I can't help feeling this theft wasn't satisfying."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He spoke only his genuine feelings, but this offhand remark froze Zeng Jide in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sun Lingtong, puzzled, called out, "Senior? Senior?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zeng Jide's expression darkened, his brows furrowed as he glared toward the City Lord's Mansion, a mixture of anger and humiliation on his face. "Very well, you Forgetful River Prefecture Lord," he muttered. "Very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He clapped Sun Lingtong on the shoulder. "Kid, it's been a good thing traveling with you. Thanks to your warning, I nearly fell into the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's trap!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong was even more confused. "Huh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zeng Jide gritted his teeth and snorted in the direction of the City Lord's Mansion. "Kid, how about we go back inside the City Lord's Mansion and plunder it clean?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong hadn't expected such a sudden change in Zeng Jide's attitude. He quickly nodded. "That would be fantastic!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zeng Jide laughed heartily. "You Foundation Establishment brat, you've got more guts than I do!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Sun Lingtong quickly clasped his hands in respect. "It's all because you're here, Old Zeng! If I were alone, I'd have fled far away by now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Being trusted by a junior he admired brought immense satisfaction to Zeng Jide. He laughed again, grabbed Sun Lingtong's arm, and used Shadow Escape to slip back into the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">At the Altar Battlefield, Luo Si was locked in a desperate struggle with the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, while Ning Zhuo hovered before a tributary of the Wangchuan River, too afraid to advance even half a step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo strained every ounce of his strength to push the Ice Coffin into the Branch of the Wangchuan River, initially freezing the surface of the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">But the awakening of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form shattered Ning Zhuo's plan completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Prefecture Lord held a strand of beads, continuously twirling them between his fingers, controlling the movement of the Wangchuan River's branch through this method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">If Sun Lingtong were there, he would have immediately recognized that many of the beads were River of Oblivion Vortex Eyes. Each one was a fully potent Magic Artifact!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">These natural Magic Artifacts often had a single, highly targeted function. No man-made magic treasure could possibly affect the Wangchuan River to this extent, but these Vortex Eyes could achieve it effortlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Fundamentally, they were born from the Wangchuan River itself, one with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Prefecture Lord's aura surged violently as he maintained the spell, manipulating the branch to swallow the Ice Coffin deep within its center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">There, a whirlpool formed, trapping the Ice Coffin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Ice Coffin's cold energy seeped outward, freezing the branch. But the whirlpool relentlessly flung ice chunks outward while drawing water inward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The expelled ice was quickly transformed back into water by the Prefecture Lord's spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Through this method, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord completely enveloped the Ice Coffin, isolating it from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Facing two Soul Formation-level opponents simultaneously, Ning Zhuo felt as if he had plunged into an ice cavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">How could he possibly fight this?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The gap between them was simply too vast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">But his initial panic quickly dissipated, and a glint of realization flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes. "The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's True Form... seems surprisingly weak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">If it weren't, the Prefecture Lord would have flown out of the Branch of the Wangchuan River long ago to slay Ning Zhuo. Instead, he remained stationed within the tributary, even employing a gradual wear-down strategy to deal with the Ice Coffin. For the moment, Ning Zhuo, trapped outside the tributary, was unable to make another move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"If the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is so weak, could I seize the opportunity to force my way across the tributary?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo shook his head, dismissing the bold idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The interior of the tributary was constantly freezing over, while its exterior churned violently, its waves towering. If he tried to force a crossing, he would be instantly swept into the torrent. At that moment, the Prefecture Lord would likely strike, drowning him in the river!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"But the Ice Coffin is lost. How can I solve the river-crossing problem now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo frowned deeply, feeling utterly stumped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He had nearly solved this problem. But the critical key—the Ice Coffin—had been lost, and the Prefecture Lord's timely awakening had rendered his efforts futile!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Gritting his teeth, Ning Zhuo rapidly pondered but couldn't devise a countermeasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He subconsciously touched his Mechanism Ring, but it remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo's heart sank further, his earlier suspicion resurfacing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He immediately changed his thoughts, silently willing himself to forcefully cross the Branch of the Wangchuan River, then turn back to assist Luo Si in the close-quarters battle against the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Mechanism Ring remained utterly silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"So, the Innate Talent bound to the ring has been suppressed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Did this suppression begin the moment I set foot on the Black Cloud Battlefield?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">With the Ice Coffin falling into enemy hands, the Mechanism Ring could no longer provide Ning Zhuo with any guidance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The ring had been such a valuable ally to Ning Zhuo that the burly youth couldn't help but feel panic rising. He thought, "Is this situation hopeless? Should I retreat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">He wavered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">But in that fleeting moment, he ruthlessly quelled his wavering resolve!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"My mother and the boss are still on another route. They're counting on me. How could I falter here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"The Living Realm's Destiny delivered me to this stage. It couldn't possibly be to send me to my death."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"If the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord can temporarily detain the Ice Coffin and suppress the Living Realm's Heavenly Mandate's retribution against him, then I can surely make a difference and create more opportunities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"This is a formidable challenge!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Despite these thoughts, a faint smile curved Ning Zhuo's lips as his fighting spirit, having hit rock bottom, rebounded and surged upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">This kind of adversity was nothing new to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Wasn't it just like this back at Fire Persimmon Immortal City and Lava Immortal Palace?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo's unshakable resolve steadied him once more, and he began to ponder how to break through the impasse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"The Ghost Tide surges, threatening the White Paper Peril; a Lone Goose carries a candle to pierce the Heavenly Veil. A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot; when myriad lamps illuminate, the calamity will crumble on its own." He silently recited the prophetic poem again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He chewed over this line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Following the sequence of the verses, the previous line—"A Lone Goose carries a candle to pierce the Heavenly Veil"—had already been fulfilled. Therefore, the next line—"A guest star should shine north of the Literary Pivot"—must hold the key to breaking the deadlock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo had long since grasped the implications of this verse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Back in White Paper Immortal City, he had specifically asked Wen Ruanyu, a Confucian cultivator, to interpret the Sacrificial Text of the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Not only had Ning Zhuo obtained the interpretation, but he had also received substantial support from Wen Ruanyu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"This poem points the way to breaking the formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"In other words, the true path lies in dismantling this Grand Formation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"What kind of formation is this? Where are the formation's foundation, eye, and core?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo was utterly clueless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He gazed at the sacrificial altar, speculating inwardly: "The altar is clearly the core. It must be the formation's core."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">But even if his conjecture was correct, it was useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">To destroy the altar, he would first have to cross the Branch of the Wangchuan River, creating an insoluble deadlock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">He looked around again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The pitch-black battlefield was enveloped in a thick layer of Earthly Fiend Qi, forming a formidable barrier in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">A spiritual light flashed in Ning Zhuo's divine sea. "Could it be that we should retreat and confront the Grand Formation on the Black Cloud Battlefield once more?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He felt this answer was likely correct, but as he gazed in Luo Si's direction, he couldn't help but hesitate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was surrounded by the roaring sound of water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"The Yin Jiuzhu is my greatest enemy!" the Prefecture Lord lamented inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle sealed the Nether Dragon Scissors. Even when the Prefecture Lord unleashed his True Form, he could only gradually erode the seal, remaining far from breaking it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">This was because the Candle wasn't a simple ice elemental artifact. It combined the inverted fire element with water, then infused it with yin attributes to achieve its icy nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">This was one of the Yin Jiuzhu's signature techniques. If it were easily broken, he wouldn't have earned the title of Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Regain the Nether Dragon Scissors, and everything will fall into place!" The Prefecture Lord continuously twirled his bead strand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Crack... Crack...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Amidst the faint sounds, cracks began to appear on the surface of the River of Oblivion Vortex Eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The Prefecture Lord displayed great strength, but in truth, his condition was dire. Even when manipulating the Branch of the Wangchuan River, he relied almost entirely on the bead strand, barely able to provide any spiritual energy support. As a result, the strand was rapidly depleting his own reserves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Ning Zhuo's assessment was accurate. In this state, the Prefecture Lord's combat capabilities were deeply concerning, and remaining stationed within the Branch of the Wangchuan River was the wisest course of action.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
