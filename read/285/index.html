<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">A woman with a delicate face, tinged with a layer of bluish-gray, hid in the shadows of a narrow alley. It was Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The roars of demonic beasts suddenly echoed from afar. Han Ming looked up and saw a group of Red Rock Demons flying over Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Immediately, the city guards noticed the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">A series of spells shot into the sky, exploding like fireworks in a myriad of colors. Many Red Rock Demons fell as a result, and a small crisis was smoothly resolved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Han Ming withdrew her gaze, looking straight ahead at the City Lord's Mansion across the street. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"I am already caught in this massive whirlpool of conflict," Han Ming sighed deeply, her face full of bitterness. Had she known it would come to this, she would have chosen to flee far away, leaving Fire Persimmon Immortal City behind entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Yet, she was unwilling to admit defeat or give up. She hadn't participated in the battle of Qi Bai. She had been manipulated by Ning Zhuo. And, after realizing she had been tricked, hid herself, narrowly escaping disaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Perhaps this experience fueled her sense of luck, allowing her to remain hidden in the Immortal City until now -- when she was ultimately captured by Luo Shang and used as a pawn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Luo Shang didn't plant any restrictions on me. Perhaps I can simply escape?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This thought had only just arisen before Han Ming immediately buried it. It was precisely because Luo Shang didn't plant restrictions that Han Ming was extremely wary. She had already guessed that this was likely a test from Luo Shang. If she tried to escape, Luo Shang would surely capture her again, and by then her treatment would not be as it was now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Luo Shang is different from Qi Bai." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Qi Bai came from humble beginnings, while Luo Shang had the backing of sect elders. Luo Shang's foundation is far more profound than Qi Bai's." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Not to mention, Luo Shang came here on an important mission from his sect, receiving substantial support." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Golden Core-level Ghost Generals -- Qi Bai has none, but Luo Shang has many." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Could it be that right now, there's a Golden Core-level Ghost General watching over me?" Han Ming couldn't be sure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">She was a peak Foundation Establishment demon cultivator and with her own means alone, it was quite difficult to detect whether there were Golden Core-level Ghost Generals around her. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Though her means were lacking, she possessed the wisdom of a demon cultivator and used it to survive. Based on her deductions, she knew that if she acted according to Luo Shang's arrangements, there might still be hope. If she truly tried to flee, the outcome would surely be tragic!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Since the night of the bombardment, the City Lord's Mansion had been brightly lit. At present, the brightly lit mansion seemed like a beast with its bloody maw wide open, ready to devour people. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Han Ming steeled herself. She stepped out of the shadows and walked slowly towards the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">She had just appeared when she was spotted by the city guards. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Who goes there?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Halt!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Han Ming shouted, "I am Han Ming, a wanted criminal of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. I have come to surrender and report a crime!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The guards exchanged suspicious glances, not daring to make a decision on their own. Someone immediately ran back to the City Lord's Mansion to report to Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"What? Han Ming suddenly appeared and voluntarily surrendered?" Fei Si heard the news, but his face showed no joy. At the critical moment of the demonic beast siege, he didn't want any unexpected incidents. However, Han Ming's appearance was not something he could control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Fei Si, with his keen intuition, immediately understood that Han Ming's strange actions must have been instructed. "She is a member of the Soul Devouring Sect, backed by a super sect of the demonic path. This time, might she be acting under Luo Shang's orders?" The more Fei Si thought about it, the more severe his expression became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Bring her in!" Fei Si decisively decided to personally interrogate her. At the same time, he urgently sent a flying message and dispatched a messenger to invite Chi Dun to assist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Given the current situation, Fei Si was extremely cautious, fearing that the Soul Devouring Sect might target the City Lord's Mansion or himself. After all, the opponent was a major sect of the demonic path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Soon, Fei Si arrived at the court and saw Han Ming, who was bound. Fei Si struck the gavel and sternly questioned her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Despite her inner anxiety, Han Ming maintained a smile, showing neither arrogance nor servility even in the face of pressure from a Golden Core cultivator, even appearing quite confident. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">She slowly recounted how she was plotted against, abused by Chui Tiao Ke, and witnessed Yuan Dasheng's corpse, telling everything to Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Take Han Ming to the dungeon!" Fei Si ordered sternly. Han Ming continued to smile, actively cooperating. Her demeanor made Fei Si's face darken like water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Fei Si, well-versed in politics and having seen many schemes, immediately realized that there was extreme malicious intent; this was the Soul Devouring Sect's attempt to sow discord between Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji. Although he knew it was the enemy's scheme, he dared not act on his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He wrote a letter on the spot, dispatching a messenger to urgently convey this intelligence to Meng Kui. Due to the demonic beast tide ravaging Fire Persimmon Mountain, the usual flying messages couldn't reach Meng Kui. Therefore, the messenger, a skilled swordsman, used a flying sword to carry Fei Si's letter, charging all the way to the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The messenger, upon reaching the sky above the mountain, was shocked by the sight of the beast tide at the mountain pass. "The Lava Immortal Palace has several breaches!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"The beast tide here is truly terrifying! Compared to this, the attack on Immortal City is comparatively small." The messenger was astonished and paid respects to Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Meng Kui, with a sweep of his divine sense, immediately grasped the contents of the letter. "Ning Zhuo... Soul Devouring Sect... and Void Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">This wise general pondered for a few breaths before extending his hand. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Spell: Learning the mysteries within! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The giant hand, formed by Nascent Soul-level mana, carried Fei Si's letter, charged forward while crushing countless demonic beasts, and reached a breach in the light barrier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Subsequently, a small part of the mana hand separated, enveloping the flying message, and pierced through the air towards a certain place in the Immortal Palace. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Previously, Meng Kui couldn't have achieved this. But with the damage to the Immortal Palace, the power of the restrictions greatly diminished, giving Meng Kui a small opportunity to exert Foundation Establishment-level combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The letter's intended recipient was none other than Zhu Xuanji. Having passed the first round of the palace examination, Zhu Xuanji, unlike the others, didn't actively prepare for the second round but instead came to the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">A large group of Scarlet Flame Beasts led by Flame Lizards was charging towards this place. The mechanical constructs responsible for blocking them were quite sparse and many cultivators watched without engaging. This was Zhu Xuanji's deliberate arrangement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He wanted to approach the Golden Furnace, but it was a critical area of the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest, meaning outsiders like Zhu Xuanji had no right to approach. However, if the Scarlet Flame Beasts reached near the Golden Furnace, Zhu Xuanji would have the opportunity; under the guise of repelling the invaders, he could reach the Golden Furnace, employ his methods, and investigate past events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The information left by Ning Xiaohui after her death, when deduced by Meng Kui, yielded four clues: Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, Zheng Danlian, and the Golden Furnace. Zhu Xuanji had been fixated on these clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">His extensive experience in handling cases made him feel that something extremely important was hidden within. Therefore, even with the second round of the palace examination imminent, he had to take this action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit paced nervously. "Zhu Xuanji, Zhu Xuanji! Why do you haunt me like a ghost? Why must you make things difficult for me at every turn?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Alas, how unlucky I am to be entangled with you!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gnashed its teeth, filled with resentment towards Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">With no other choice, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had to suppress its voice and contact Ning Zhuo again. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Young master, young, young master, it's me, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit." Its tone was extremely weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">This wasn't entirely an act; with the Lava Immortal Palace damaged, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was indeed in poor condition. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo was quite surprised to receive the sudden contact from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit. He quickly inquired about the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit suppressed its agitation, "Th-thank you, young master, for your concern. Little spirit is not dead yet." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"That Zhu Xuanji is trying to cause trouble again!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Right now, he wants to use the beast tide to investigate the Golden Furnace in the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Young master, I seem to have told you before, didn't I? Yuan Dasheng was made into a mechanical construct by using up a Golden Furnace." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"If Zhu Xuanji discovers this..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo's pupils slightly contracted and he quickly praised the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, indicating he would immediately stop Zhu Xuanji's actions. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit showed a hint of excitement and continued in a weak tone, "Young master, you are indeed decisive, unlike ordinary people. Let's cooperate now and use the five elements cannon tower to strike them a hard blow!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo, however, refused, "This matter is somewhat inappropriate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit widened its eyes, anxious, "What's inappropriate? Young master, you mustn't hesitate!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo sighed, "My merits... In the last palace examination settlement, my merits were deducted too much. If I hadn't timely submitted my Buddha Heart Demon Seal, I would have lost the opportunity for the palace examination!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit coughed violently twice, "Young master, you are wise and powerful, truly remarkable! Even when little spirit is in a terrible state and unable to care for you, you can make such judgments on your own, unlike ordinary people." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"But now, if Zhu Xuanji discovers something, what use is more merit?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Young master, quickly fire the cannon!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so anxious it was spinning in circles. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Alright!" Ning Zhuo's straightforward answer delighted the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He began to exercise his authority, raising the six-layer five elements cannon tower again, with the cannon muzzles all aimed at the Golden Furnace's location in the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest. Mana surged in, and the cannon muzzles lit up with a bright glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Fire, fire!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was secretly thrilled. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Just as they were about to fire, Ning Zhuo suddenly said, "Oh, by the way, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, do you know the specific theme of the second round of the palace examination?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: !!?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">At that moment, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit truly wanted to rush to Ning Zhuo and give him a fierce headbutt! At such a critical time, why ask about this and that!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shouted, "Young master, quickly fire first. If you don't fire now, it will be too late!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo shook his head, "I'm very hesitant. If I fire this round, my merits will be deducted again. To participate in the palace examination, I even submitted my Buddha Heart Demon Seal. Therefore, I am determined to win the position of palace master!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Quickly tell me the content of the next palace examination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Otherwise, if I can't compete for the palace master position and lose my Buddha Heart Demon Seal, I might as well be captured now!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: ......</paragraph><br/><br/>
