After many days, Ning Zhuo returned to his home once again.<br/>
<br/>
Looking around, everything was brand new!<br/>
<br/>
The house, the furniture, even the underground secret chamber had been rebuilt.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since Ning Zhuo became the master of the black market, the speed of rebuilding his home skyrocketed, more than ten times faster than before!<br/>
<br/>
The most crucial aspect was that the formation in his home was interconnected with the Fire Persimmon Immortal City Grand Formation, allowing it to leverage the grand formation's powerful defensive capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Ning Zhuo's home was destroyed in an explosion.<br/>
<br/>
If such an attack were to happen again, the defensive formation would ensure it wouldn't repeat.<br/>
<br/>
In the small courtyard of his home.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gathered his fellow reformation team members, once again appraising and purchasing their mechanical constructs, followed by sharing his insights on spellcasting.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone listened intently, except for Ning Ji, who appeared serious but was mentally wandering.<br/>
<br/>
As the session concluded, Ning Zhuo, with an earnest expression, addressed everyone, "There is something I believe you all have heard about." "Yes, yesterday I publicly proved that Ning Xiaohui's injury to me during the previous battle was a 'mistake' and not intentional."<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing Ning Zhuo bring up this topic, everyone's expressions changed dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong, indignant, raised his head and said, "Brother Zhuo, was it the main branch that forced you? Don't worry, we all stand with you!" As soon as Ning Yong finished speaking, others echoed his sentiment.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui really went too far!"<br/>
<br/>
"If it weren't for her causing trouble, we would have already defeated that mechanical ape."<br/>
<br/>
"At worst, we can stir up the ancestral hall again!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo raised his hand and pressed down a few times, and the courtyard immediately fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, "The internal strife between the main and branch families of the Ning family has come to this!"<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest with you all, the Ning family patriarch personally approached me, offering a hefty sum to have me prove Ning Xiaohui's 'innocence.' Initially, I was unwilling. But then I thought of the Ning family, of its reputation."<br/>
<br/>
"If I were to hold onto Ning Xiaohui's mistake, stirring up conflict between the main and branch families, wouldn't it make us a laughingstock to outsiders?"<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh... Ning Xiaohui treated me this way, but I cannot drag down the family's reputation."<br/>
<br/>
"So, I accepted the patriarch's bribe and even raised the price significantly."<br/>
<br/>
"I publicly proved Ning Xiaohui's innocence and chose this method of handling it. I hope everyone can let go of this matter and focus on your own cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's words moved everyone deeply.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Zhuo, you've sacrificed so much for the family!" Ning Yong shouted.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Chen wiped his tears, "Brother Zhuo, you've truly endured humiliation for the greater good. But who can understand your pain?"<br/>
<br/>
Others chimed in, "Brother Zhuo, I was wrong. I misunderstood you and thought you were bought off by the main branch!"<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Zhuo, with such magnanimity, you are bound to suffer losses. The main branch should learn from you."<br/>
<br/>
"No one else commands my respect like you do. Brother Zhuo, from now on, I will follow you!"<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the excitement in the courtyard, Ning Zhuo noticed that the Life Hanging by a Threads above their heads were expanding and becoming more solid.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, Ning Zhuo was touched, and a flash of insight struck his mind.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly understood, "To strengthen the Life Hanging by a Threads, what is needed is more recognition. The higher the degree of recognition, the more solid and stable the Life Hanging by a Threads become."<br/>
<br/>
"This recognition is mutual."<br/>
<br/>
"When I understand someone, their past, present, and estimate their future, that is a form of recognition."<br/>
<br/>
"After my recognition, the Life Hanging by a Threads are planted. When the recognized person also recognizes me, the threads are reinforced."<br/>
<br/>
"Recognition is not expectation, nor is it submission. Recognition is simply recognition!"<br/>
<br/>
This realization, though brief, was the final piece of the puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the bud of the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability slowly opened and suddenly bloomed.<br/>
<br/>
White lotus roots like jade, pure and translucent; green leaves like emerald, lush and verdant; pink lotus like the dawn, delicate and charming.<br/>
<br/>
White lotus roots, green leaves, pink lotus!<br/>
<br/>
The Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability—achieved!<br/>
<br/>
Completely successful, no longer a prototype, but a complete divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
Divine ability, divine ability!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was overjoyed, his heart racing.<br/>
<br/>
He was merely at the Qi Refining Stage, yet he had mastered a divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
What an extraordinary achievement!<br/>
<br/>
If word got out, no one in the Immortal City would believe it.<br/>
<br/>
One must know, most Golden Core Stage cultivators never achieve a single divine ability in their lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
But soon, Ning Zhuo shook his head and reminded himself:<br/>
<br/>
"This is nothing."<br/>
<br/>
"It's not something I comprehended on my own; I took a shortcut!"<br/>
<br/>
"It's all thanks to the inheritance of the three sects' seniors that I made such rapid progress and finally mastered the complete Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability."<br/>
<br/>
"And thanks to my mother's dying words, which set my resolve to seize the Lava Immortal Palace. That was the foundation of all my recent progress."<br/>
<br/>
"Mother..."<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of his mother, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
"You wouldn't have imagined, even though I'm only at the Qi Refining Stage, I've mastered a divine ability."<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Ning Zhuo felt vulnerable at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to share his hard-earned achievement with his mother.<br/>
<br/>
But he couldn't.<br/>
<br/>
His mother had long passed away, and he had no memory of his father.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, he had someone else to share with.<br/>
<br/>
In the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo once again met with Sun Lingtong, "Brother Sun, I did it, I did it!"<br/>
<br/>
"I've mastered the complete Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability!"<br/>
<br/>
"Really?!" Sun Lingtong's eyes widened, then he joyfully raised his arms, "Haha! Little Zhuo, with your personality, if you say so, it must be true."<br/>
<br/>
"Amazing."<br/>
<br/>
"You are truly amazing!"<br/>
<br/>
"To master a divine ability at the Qi Refining Stage, such an achievement, if spread, would make you the target of super sects vying for you."<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, you are a genius, a true genius!!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed heartily a few times, then lowered his head, taking a deep breath, "Brother Sun, you flatter me. I know I still have a long way to go."<br/>
<br/>
"This divine ability comes from the Illusory True Lotus Seeds. I was just lucky to obtain them and use them on myself."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong opened his mouth, "Uh, Little Zhuo..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo ignored him, humbly speaking for a long time until he gradually calmed down.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong watched him with a smile throughout, looking at this genius young cultivator he had raised from childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Sun Lingtong had an epiphany: Ning Zhuo's humility was deeply rooted in his heart, an intrinsic behavior, a tool for quickly adjusting his mindset.<br/>
<br/>
Only when Ning Zhuo stopped rambling did Sun Lingtong say, "Quick, tell me about the wonders of the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, young man!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo scratched his head and grinned, "After the divine ability is complete, I can feel a qualitative change."<br/>
<br/>
"A qualitative change in every aspect!"<br/>
<br/>
"It's hard to explain just by talking. How about this, Brother Sun, I'll give you a demonstration."<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he finished speaking, Ning Zhuo used the Life Hanging by a Thread to transmit some information to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong immediately received the message.<br/>
<br/>
Just like the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit transmitting key information to the trial disciples through the Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo could now do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then cast an enhancement spell.<br/>
<br/>
The spell traveled along the Life Hanging by a Thread and directly affected Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's hair stood on end, his body swelled, growing at least thirteen times larger, with muscles bulging all over, except his face remained the same, still a baby face.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: ...<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo directly controlled the Life Hanging by a Thread.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong tiptoed, involuntarily sticking out his butt, and started dancing gracefully.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: ?!<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, alright, the divine ability is indeed powerful, no need to test further, Little Zhuo." Sun Lingtong felt something was amiss and stopped Ning Zhuo in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo exclaimed, "Brother Sun, let me try one more time, just one more time, I promise!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sighed, "I really can't do anything about you, go ahead."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo chuckled, fixed his gaze on Sun Lingtong, then looked again.<br/>
<br/>
"Finished?" Sun Lingtong was puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, "All done."<br/>
<br/>
He continued to explain, "Brother Sun, you didn't feel it. Just now, I canceled the Life Hanging by a Thread and then planted a new one on you."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong immediately understood, "So, you can use it in actual combat now?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded emphatically, "It seems so."<br/>
<br/>
"The range, time, and difficulty of planting the Life Hanging by a Thread have all drastically decreased."<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, the most important factor is still the degree of mutual recognition."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong clapped his hands in joy, then frowned, "Mutual recognition?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn't hide anything from him, sharing his understanding and insights about the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
After listening, Sun Lingtong felt greatly enlightened.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, you have great insight!" Sun Lingtong sincerely praised.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "I still have a long way to go. Compared to those true geniuses, I'm nothing."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: ...<br/>
<br/>
Ning Family Estate.<br/>
<br/>
The door to the cultivation chamber opened, and Ning Xiaohui's grandmother entered, looking sorrowful.<br/>
<br/>
"Xiaohui, my dear Xiaohui, eat something. You can't go on without eating or drinking."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui, looking haggard, slowly turned around, her expression numb, "Grandmother, why would I harm Ning Zhuo? I don't understand, why would I do that!"<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Xiaohui's anguished questioning, her grandmother's heart broke.<br/>
<br/>
She quickly came to Ning Xiaohui's side, opened her arms, and held her granddaughter, comforting her.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui cried in her grandmother's arms for a long time before calming down.<br/>
<br/>
"Xiaohui, I've discussed with the patriarch." Her grandmother said gently, "We don't need to enter the Immortal Palace. Getting too close to Ning Zhuo's branch will bring no good!"<br/>
<br/>
"Starting tomorrow, you will enter the Immortal Palace with the family team."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui looked up at her grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
After a long while, she nodded slightly and softly replied, "Okay."<br/>
<br/>
Only then did her grandmother breathe a sigh of relief, feeling slightly at ease.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo!" Her grandmother gritted her teeth, "You've caused my granddaughter so much pain. One day, I will make you pay a hundredfold!"</div></body></html></div>
