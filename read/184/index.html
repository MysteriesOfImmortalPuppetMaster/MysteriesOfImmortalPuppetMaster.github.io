<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 184: Lotus Blooming, Divine Ability Achieved!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">After many days, Ning Zhuo returned to his home once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Looking around, everything was brand new!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The house, the furniture, even the underground secret chamber had been rebuilt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ever since Ning Zhuo became the master of the black market, the speed of rebuilding his home skyrocketed, more than ten times faster than before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The most crucial aspect was that the formation in his home was interconnected with the Fire Persimmon Immortal City Grand Formation, allowing it to leverage the grand formation's powerful defensive capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Previously, Ning Zhuo's home was destroyed in an explosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">If such an attack were to happen again, the defensive formation would ensure it wouldn't repeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In the small courtyard of his home.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo gathered his fellow reformation team members, once again appraising and purchasing their mechanical constructs, followed by sharing his insights on spellcasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Everyone listened intently, except for Ning Ji, who appeared serious but was mentally wandering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">As the session concluded, Ning Zhuo, with an earnest expression, addressed everyone, "There is something I believe you all have heard about." "Yes, yesterday I publicly proved that Ning Xiaohui's injury to me during the previous battle was a 'mistake' and not intentional."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Upon hearing Ning Zhuo bring up this topic, everyone's expressions changed dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Yong, indignant, raised his head and said, "Brother Zhuo, was it the main branch that forced you? Don't worry, we all stand with you!" As soon as Ning Yong finished speaking, others echoed his sentiment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Ning Xiaohui really went too far!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"If it weren't for her causing trouble, we would have already defeated that mechanical ape."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"At worst, we can stir up the ancestral hall again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo raised his hand and pressed down a few times, and the courtyard immediately fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, "The internal strife between the main and branch families of the Ning family has come to this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"To be honest with you all, the Ning family patriarch personally approached me, offering a hefty sum to have me prove Ning Xiaohui's 'innocence.' Initially, I was unwilling. But then I thought of the Ning family, of its reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"If I were to hold onto Ning Xiaohui's mistake, stirring up conflict between the main and branch families, wouldn't it make us a laughingstock to outsiders?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Sigh... Ning Xiaohui treated me this way, but I cannot drag down the family's reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"So, I accepted the patriarch's bribe and even raised the price significantly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"I publicly proved Ning Xiaohui's innocence and chose this method of handling it. I hope everyone can let go of this matter and focus on your own cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo's words moved everyone deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Brother Zhuo, you've sacrificed so much for the family!" Ning Yong shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Chen wiped his tears, "Brother Zhuo, you've truly endured humiliation for the greater good. But who can understand your pain?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Others chimed in, "Brother Zhuo, I was wrong. I misunderstood you and thought you were bought off by the main branch!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Brother Zhuo, with such magnanimity, you are bound to suffer losses. The main branch should learn from you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"No one else commands my respect like you do. Brother Zhuo, from now on, I will follow you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Seeing the excitement in the courtyard, Ning Zhuo noticed that the Life Hanging by a Threads above their heads were expanding and becoming more solid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">For a moment, Ning Zhuo was touched, and a flash of insight struck his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He suddenly understood, "To strengthen the Life Hanging by a Threads, what is needed is more recognition. The higher the degree of recognition, the more solid and stable the Life Hanging by a Threads become."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"This recognition is mutual."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"When I understand someone, their past, present, and estimate their future, that is a form of recognition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"After my recognition, the Life Hanging by a Threads are planted. When the recognized person also recognizes me, the threads are reinforced."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Recognition is not expectation, nor is it submission. Recognition is simply recognition!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This realization, though brief, was the final piece of the puzzle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In an instant, the bud of the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability slowly opened and suddenly bloomed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">White lotus roots like jade, pure and translucent; green leaves like emerald, lush and verdant; pink lotus like the dawn, delicate and charming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">White lotus roots, green leaves, pink lotus!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability—achieved!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Completely successful, no longer a prototype, but a complete divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Divine ability, divine ability!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo was overjoyed, his heart racing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He was merely at the Qi Refining Stage, yet he had mastered a divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">What an extraordinary achievement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">If word got out, no one in the Immortal City would believe it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">One must know, most Golden Core Stage cultivators never achieve a single divine ability in their lifetime.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">But soon, Ning Zhuo shook his head and reminded himself:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"This is nothing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"It's not something I comprehended on my own; I took a shortcut!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"It's all thanks to the inheritance of the three sects' seniors that I made such rapid progress and finally mastered the complete Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"And thanks to my mother's dying words, which set my resolve to seize the Lava Immortal Palace. That was the foundation of all my recent progress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Mother..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Thinking of his mother, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"You wouldn't have imagined, even though I'm only at the Qi Refining Stage, I've mastered a divine ability."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Suddenly, Ning Zhuo felt vulnerable at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He wanted to share his hard-earned achievement with his mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">But he couldn't.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His mother had long passed away, and he had no memory of his father.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Fortunately, he had someone else to share with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In the underground base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo once again met with Sun Lingtong, "Brother Sun, I did it, I did it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"I've mastered the complete Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Really?!" Sun Lingtong's eyes widened, then he joyfully raised his arms, "Haha! Little Zhuo, with your personality, if you say so, it must be true."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Amazing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"You are truly amazing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"To master a divine ability at the Qi Refining Stage, such an achievement, if spread, would make you the target of super sects vying for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Little Zhuo, you are a genius, a true genius!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily a few times, then lowered his head, taking a deep breath, "Brother Sun, you flatter me. I know I still have a long way to go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"This divine ability comes from the Illusory True Lotus Seeds. I was just lucky to obtain them and use them on myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong opened his mouth, "Uh, Little Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo ignored him, humbly speaking for a long time until he gradually calmed down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Sun Lingtong watched him with a smile throughout, looking at this genius young cultivator he had raised from childhood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Suddenly, Sun Lingtong had an epiphany: Ning Zhuo's humility was deeply rooted in his heart, an intrinsic behavior, a tool for quickly adjusting his mindset.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Only when Ning Zhuo stopped rambling did Sun Lingtong say, "Quick, tell me about the wonders of the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, young man!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo scratched his head and grinned, "After the divine ability is complete, I can feel a qualitative change."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"A qualitative change in every aspect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"It's hard to explain just by talking. How about this, Brother Sun, I'll give you a demonstration."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">As soon as he finished speaking, Ning Zhuo used the Life Hanging by a Thread to transmit some information to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sun Lingtong immediately received the message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Just like the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit transmitting key information to the trial disciples through the Life Hanging by a Thread, Ning Zhuo could now do the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo then cast an enhancement spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The spell traveled along the Life Hanging by a Thread and directly affected Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong's hair stood on end, his body swelled, growing at least thirteen times larger, with muscles bulging all over, except his face remained the same, still a baby face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo directly controlled the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Sun Lingtong tiptoed, involuntarily sticking out his butt, and started dancing gracefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Alright, alright, the divine ability is indeed powerful, no need to test further, Little Zhuo." Sun Lingtong felt something was amiss and stopped Ning Zhuo in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo exclaimed, "Brother Sun, let me try one more time, just one more time, I promise!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sun Lingtong sighed, "I really can't do anything about you, go ahead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo chuckled, fixed his gaze on Sun Lingtong, then looked again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Finished?" Sun Lingtong was puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo nodded, "All done."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He continued to explain, "Brother Sun, you didn't feel it. Just now, I canceled the Life Hanging by a Thread and then planted a new one on you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Sun Lingtong immediately understood, "So, you can use it in actual combat now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo nodded emphatically, "It seems so."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"The range, time, and difficulty of planting the Life Hanging by a Thread have all drastically decreased."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Of course, the most important factor is still the degree of mutual recognition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Sun Lingtong clapped his hands in joy, then frowned, "Mutual recognition?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo didn't hide anything from him, sharing his understanding and insights about the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">After listening, Sun Lingtong felt greatly enlightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Little Zhuo, you have great insight!" Sun Lingtong sincerely praised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo: "I still have a long way to go. Compared to those true geniuses, I'm nothing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Sun Lingtong: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Family Estate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The door to the cultivation chamber opened, and Ning Xiaohui's grandmother entered, looking sorrowful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Xiaohui, my dear Xiaohui, eat something. You can't go on without eating or drinking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Xiaohui, looking haggard, slowly turned around, her expression numb, "Grandmother, why would I harm Ning Zhuo? I don't understand, why would I do that!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Seeing Ning Xiaohui's anguished questioning, her grandmother's heart broke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">She quickly came to Ning Xiaohui's side, opened her arms, and held her granddaughter, comforting her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Xiaohui cried in her grandmother's arms for a long time before calming down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Xiaohui, I've discussed with the patriarch." Her grandmother said gently, "We don't need to enter the Immortal Palace. Getting too close to Ning Zhuo's branch will bring no good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Starting tomorrow, you will enter the Immortal Palace with the family team."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Xiaohui looked up at her grandmother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">After a long while, she nodded slightly and softly replied, "Okay."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Only then did her grandmother breathe a sigh of relief, feeling slightly at ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Ning Zhuo!" Her grandmother gritted her teeth, "You've caused my granddaughter so much pain. One day, I will make you pay a hundredfold!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
