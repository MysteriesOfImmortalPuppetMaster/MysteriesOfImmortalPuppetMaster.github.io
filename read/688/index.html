<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Su Lingkou hesitated, glancing at Lin Jinglong before her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Lin Jinglong was of the same caliber as Shen Xi, a young prodigy who had long since made a name for himself. Su Lingkou knew his identity well, but her intense gaze was now focused on Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Gongsun Yan stood beside Lin Jinglong, his subordinate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">His appearance was strikingly inhuman, radiating fiery Qi that raised the surrounding air temperature with even a brief presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">His skin resembled bronze, crisscrossed with lava-like fissures. His right arm was wrapped in dragon-scale fire-resistant cloth, while the bones of his left arm were exposed, gleaming with a dark golden luster. Cold marrow shackles bound his ankles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">What truly concerned Su Lingkou was the intelligence she had gathered about Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"This is the man with the low-grade Melting Heart Innate Talent. Ah... if only Cousin had possessed such talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Lin Jinglong, tall and lean, still wore his signature azure robes trimmed with gold embroidery. He smiled faintly at Shen Xi. "Brother Shen, where is Ning Zhuo, the recruit you mentioned? How should we proceed with our duel?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">It turned out that after Shen Xi, Yu Heye, and Ning Zhuo had gathered for drinks at Boulder Cave Mansion, Shen Xi returned to inform Situ Xing that Ning Zhuo had been confirmed as qualified to join their group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">To strengthen his argument, Shen Xi even presented the Ghost Path Golden Cores Ning Zhuo had given him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Situ Xing frowned slightly. "Even if Ning Zhuo gave you these Ghost Path Golden Cores, it doesn't prove his own strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Situ Xing continued his speculation: "Ning Zhuo's every move reeks of political maneuvering, just like the tactics of our Great Clan disciples. But he's never personally intervened in any conflict. It's likely his elders suppressed Yu Heye from behind the scenes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Or, more likely, he bribed Yu Heye with some rare treasures or materials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">As he spoke, Situ Xing glanced pointedly at the Ghost Path Golden Cores in Shen Xi's hand, his gaze almost accusing: Shen Xi, were you bribed too? Is that why you're singing Ning Zhuo's praises to me, trying to get him into our group?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Situ Xing possessed his own pride and knew that his alliance with Lin Jinglong and Shen Xi would undoubtedly shine brightly at the Flying Cloud Assembly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In recent days, many cultivators had proactively sought him out, eager to join his group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">A considerable number even offered Situ Xing bribes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After all, joining a powerful faction would make navigating the Flying Cloud Assembly far easier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Su Lingkou's willow-leaf brows arched sharply as she retorted, "This Ghost Path Golden Core wasn't cheap! My cousin had to sacrifice his Array Gap Shuttle, a magic treasure, to repay the favor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Situ Xing, stop making baseless assumptions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Situ Xing snorted coldly, unwilling to stoop to arguing with a mere girl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Though he didn't directly refute Su Lingkou, he refused to let go of his harassment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">As a scion of a Great Clan, Situ Xing's mind quickly devised a new method of torment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He fixed his gaze on Shen Xi, dredging up old grievances. He reminded everyone how he had previously defeated both Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong to claim first place, yet their subsequent duel had ended in a draw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Now that we're establishing our own faction, we naturally need a fair and transparent ranking system."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"However, it would be unseemly to have Brother Shen and Brother Lin face off again. How about this: since Brother Shen so strongly recommends Ning Zhuo, let Ning Zhuo participate in the battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"As for Brother Lin, he brought the most subordinates among us. He's sure to find a capable fighter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Shen Xi pondered for a moment, then nodded with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He had unwavering confidence in Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Thus, the current scene unfolded in the Martial Arts Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Shen Xi couldn't reach Ning Zhuo, and the battle seemed lost before it even began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Lin Jinglong clasped his hands in a fist salute. "In that case, I accept your concession, Brother Shen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Shen Xi was naturally unwilling to concede.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He had deliberately relinquished the first seat to manipulate Situ Xing into taking the lead. But the second seat had always been his target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">How could he safeguard his interests as the third-ranked member?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The second position was perfect - moderate risk with substantial rewards. In Shen Xi's mind, it was the ideal spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Unfortunately, Lin Jinglong shared the same ambition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Elite scions of Great Clans were never simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Brother Ning's absence must be due to unforeseen circumstances," Shen Xi argued, defending his position. "But if we declare victory simply because our opponent is absent, Brother Lin, do you truly wish to claim such an unfair advantage?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The smile on Lin Jinglong's face faded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Seizing the opportunity, Shen Xi proposed, "How about a best-of-three match? We'll concede this round to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Lin Jinglong pondered for a moment before nodding in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Shen Xi was adept at the art of compromise and negotiation. He acknowledged Lin Jinglong's gain while preserving his own opportunity to continue the competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Very well," Lin Jinglong conceded. "Let's proceed as you suggest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Su Lingkou, however, protested indignantly, "How can you let him get away with such an easy win? Ning Zhuo may be absent, but I'm still here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">She turned to Shen Xi, her eyes blazing with determination. "Cousin, I'll fight in the next round and secure our first victory!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Shen Xi hesitated. "But...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Su Lingkou's usual demure demeanor vanished, replaced by a fierce glint in her eyes. "Cousin!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Shen Xi chuckled wryly and reached out to touch her forehead. "Alright, be careful. If the battle turns against you, concede immediately. Losing to Fellow Daoist Gongsun is no shame - it's the same as losing to Brother Lin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Lin Jinglong, a scion of a Great Clan, spoke with polished grace and an air of amiable composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">A sharp glint flashed in Lin Jinglong's eyes as he quickly offered a few modest words, expressing his expectations to Su Lingkou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Turning to Gongsun Yan, he said, "Fellow Daoist Gongsun, I'm counting on you this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Gongsun Yan replied gruffly, "After the deed is done, don't skimp on the firewood you promised."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Lin Jinglong smiled. "Of course not. You have my word."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Gongsun Yan possessed innate talent and held an exceptional position among Lin Jinglong's subordinates, truly deserving of such special treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The two descended to the Martial Arts Arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The vast plaza, paved with massive gray-white stone bricks, was as smooth as a mirror, its edges lined with flowing runes. A faint golden protective barrier, formed by a Formation, separated the arena's interior from the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Gongsun Yan and Su Lingkou stood facing each other, the atmosphere rapidly tensing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Seeing Su Lingkou's petite frame, clad in a short, cross-collared tunic and pleated skirt that made her look like the girl next door, Gongsun Yan said in a deep voice, "Miss Su, you've drawn the short straw facing me. I'll give you a chance - I'll let you attack first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Lin Jinglong's brow furrowed imperceptibly, then smoothed out again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Su Lingkou narrowed her eyes, feeling underestimated. "You'll regret this," she said coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">With a flick of her wrist, the Mystic Water Kan Cord and Purple Fire Li Cord shot forth from her wrist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The two cords pierced the air, each trailing fine ice crystals and sparks in their wake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Gongsun Yan took a deep breath, steeling his resolve. He cast a defensive spell, enveloping himself in a semi-transparent sphere of fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">To his surprise, the cords swerved around the fiery barrier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Su Lingkou formed a hand seal, silently chanting, "Yin-Yang Interlock!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The cords twisted mid-air, instantly forming a luminous knot shaped like two Taiji Fish, their heads and tails interlocked in an endless cycle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">As the Yin Fish swallowed the Yang Eye and the Yang Fish devoured the Yin Pupil, the glowing knot crashed to the ground with a resounding hum that reverberated across the Martial Arts Arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">A layer of Profound Ice instantly spread across the gray-white stone tiles, its frigid Qi surging upward to encase Gongsun Yan's feet in a thin sheet of ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Scorching. Yet beneath the bone-chilling cold, Gongsun Yan sensed an underlying heat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He dared not underestimate his opponent. He retrieved a small hammer Magic Artifact and gripped it tightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">In the next instant, the muscles in his left arm bulged as he slammed the hammer against the ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Dong! The hammer struck like a drumbeat. The ice shattered, erupting in a torrent of crimson Flowing Fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">While Gongsun Yan was entangled with the Flowing Fire, Su Lingkou's gaze remained calm. She lifted the hem of her skirt, and the seventy-two pearls adorning it shot forth silently, scattering around Gongsun Yan like stars in the night sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">With a thought, Su Lingkou retrieved the Plain Silver Array Plate and held it in her left hand. The plate was studded with fine needles connected by delicate threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Activate Array!" she intoned sharply, and the formation plate erupted in brilliant, otherworldly light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Gongsun Yan swept aside the Flowing Fire with his hammer and strode toward Su Lingkou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But as he moved, the pearls around him began to glow, forming illusory ropes that layered around him, hindering his advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Gongsun Yan channeled his Spell into the hammer and swung it again in a sweeping arc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Though the illusory ropes shattered, they instantly transformed into a barrage of needle-like beams of light that pierced through Gongsun Yan's Protective Fire Shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The beams struck his bronze-like skin with metallic clangs, raining down relentlessly like a torrential downpour.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Enduring the assault, Gongsun Yan exhaled two streams of golden-white fire from his nostrils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The fire streams coiled around his neck, arms, and even the hammer's handle like fiery dragons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The hammer seemed to come alive, its power surging exponentially!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Gongsun Yan swung the hammer wildly once more, obliterating the remaining illusory ropes in a series of explosive strikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The reaction reached Su Lingkou's side as the fine strings on her formation plate snapped one by one, sending the inserted needles flying. One grazed her cheek, leaving a thin trail of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Her expression grave, Su Lingkou didn't hesitate. She parted her lips slightly, bit the tip of her tongue, and spat a mouthful of vital essence onto the formation plate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The plate hummed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Eight illusory ropes surged forth, coiling around Gongsun Yan's body and limbs. The small hammer in his hand was completely enveloped in layers of rope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Chaos Coiling Intestines... Knot!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The formation plate creaked under the strain. Su Lingkou poured every ounce of her strength into forming the knot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Once the knot was complete, the Formation would be fully activated, sealing Gongsun Yan on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Gongsun Yan knew this was the critical moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Without hesitation, his heart pounded like a war drum, accelerating its rhythm to unleash his Innate Talent and summon a surge of Heartfire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Heartfire erupted, engulfing him in flames yet leaving him unharmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">When the Heartfire touched the illusory ropes, they instantly glowed red, softened, and then melted away one by one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Su Lingkou matched his efforts, replenishing each melted rope with all her might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The two were locked in a stalemate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">A hairline fracture appeared at the edge of the formation plate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Gongsun Yan coughed up blood from all seven orifices, feeling as if he were being crushed by a giant python, his body on the verge of shattering from the inside out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Outside the arena, Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong exchanged a glance before simultaneously shouting:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Stop, Fellow Daoist Gongsun!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Cousin, cease hostilities!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Gongsun Yan and Su Lingkou harbored no deep-seated grudges. Hearing the calls, they gradually withdrew their power, ultimately releasing each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">This was merely a friendly exchange, not a life-or-death struggle, nor a settling of scores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">While neither Gongsun Yan nor Su Lingkou could match Lin Jinglong or Shen Xi in strength, they were both valuable subordinates to the latter two. A mutually destructive exchange resulting in severe injuries would be a significant loss for both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Moreover, any lingering injuries could jeopardize their participation in the upcoming Flying Cloud Assembly, making the situation even more dire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Cousin, I didn't win..." Su Lingkou returned to Shen Xi's side, her face etched with guilt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Shen Xi waved his hand, stopping her apology. "Fellow Daoist Gongsun's strength is remarkable," he reassured her. "There's no need for a mutually destructive outcome. I wouldn't want you to risk your life for me like that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">A faint blush crept across Su Lingkou's cheeks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Lin Jinglong interjected, "Brother Shen, how about we declare this match a draw?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Shen Xi nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Best of three," Lin Jinglong said. "Let's schedule the next match for three days from now. Brother Shen, that should give you enough time to gather your allies, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Shen Xi forced a bitter smile. "I'll do my best and leave the rest to fate. That's all I can promise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">As Lin Jinglong and Gongsun Yan departed, Su Lingkou's face clouded with worry. "Cousin, do you really think Ning Zhuo can handle this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"His mastery of the Five Elements is indeed remarkable, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's a formidable fighter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Shen Xi replied, "I trust Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"However, I must admit, I've never actually seen him in combat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"I see..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"I'll send him another urgent message immediately. But we should also start looking for other potential candidates."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo remained unaware of the urgent message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">At that moment, he was completely absorbed in another task: crafting his Natal Magical Artifact!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Earlier, while cultivating the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual, he had successfully planted a Phenomenal Seed Talisman and obtained the Natal Spirit Communication Art. This had allowed him to create the Spirit Communication Mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Now, having successfully planted a second Phenomenal Seed Talisman, he had acquired the Natal-level Five Elements Creation and Destruction Art, naturally enabling him to forge a second Natal Magical Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">This was one of the great advantages of Three Dantian Concurrent Cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Most cultivators possessed only one Lifebound Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">But in theory, Ning Zhuo could wield three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The three Mechanism Platforms once again proved invaluable to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">A brand-new Mechanical Fan had been forged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Its twelve ribs, crafted from the Five Elements, served as the Spirit Pivot Axes of this mechanical construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The fan's surface was made of Cloud Shark Silk, a pristine blank canvas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Five-pointed star-shaped rivets secured the silk, and it was here that Ning Zhuo had inscribed the talismanic seal of his Innate Spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Grasping the warm, smooth handle, Ning Zhuo gently pushed with his thumb and flicked his wrist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">With a soft poof, the twelve ribs exploded open like a startled peacock, scattering a dazzling array of five-colored light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">As the fan fully unfurled, five-colored clouds swirled across its surface, constantly shifting and transforming - sometimes erupting, sometimes vanishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">With a gentle wave of the fan, Ning Zhuo unleashed a torrent of Five Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Another wave, and the torrent rapidly dissipated, vanishing completely into the air within moments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Beneath the fan's control, the Five Elements and Five Qi were ruthlessly manipulated, flowing solely according to Ning Zhuo's will.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Ning Zhuo closed his fingers, smoothly folding the Mechanical Fan shut.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"With this fan's assistance, my strength has increased significantly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Could this be the key to resolving Meng Yehu's predicament?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo immediately retrieved the Mechanism Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Its spiritual energy lay dormant, the construct motionless. No matter how Ning Zhuo called out to it, his voice sank like a stone into the sea, eliciting no response whatsoever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Ning Zhuo unfolded the Mechanical Fan and waved it at Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Several times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Meng Yehu remained as silent as stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Ning Zhuo sighed and retrieved the frozen Yuan Dasheng, attempting the Mechanical Fan on him as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"Hmm?" As Ning Zhuo put away the two mechanical constructs and composed himself, he noticed two urgent messages from Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
