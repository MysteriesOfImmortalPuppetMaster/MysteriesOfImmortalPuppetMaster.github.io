<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 139: Escaping from the Ghost Gate</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo's interest was immediately piqued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Sun Lingtong had previously taken out the Netherworld Ghost God Seal and the Soul Stirring Rattle Drum, but neither had elicited such a look of surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Could it be that the treasure in Cheng Bai's sea of essence surpassed the previous two Magical Treasures?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Under Ning Zhuo's watchful gaze, Sun Lingtong withdrew the cloud mist, revealing a precious plant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">It was a cluster of small grass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The grass stood about three feet tall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Its stem was thick, covered with bark-like texture, and the root end was white, gradually darkening towards the leaves, eventually turning pitch black.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The leaves could be divided into two parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The lower part of the leaves was withered and curled, resembling ancient scrolls weathered by time; the upper part was vibrant, with clear veins and a faint glow at the edges, like a glimmer of hope in the darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Without Sun Lingtong needing to say a word, Ning Zhuo exclaimed, recognizing the plant's origin: "Ghost Gate Escape Grass?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This world is divided into the realms of the living and the dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The realm of the living is where Ning Zhuo resides, with the sun rising and the moon setting, full of vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The realm of the dead is filled with wandering spirits, perpetually gloomy and shrouded in deathly aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The entrances and exits between the realms of the living and the dead are called Ghost Gates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ghost Gates are one-way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">One can only enter the realm of the dead from the realm of the living, or enter the realm of the living from the realm of the dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Only near the Ghost Gates that lead from the realm of the dead to the realm of the living can Ghost Gate Escape Grass grow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The roots of this grass delve deep into the soil of the realm of the dead, absorbing deathly aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The leaves, however, stretch into the realm of the living, brimming with vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">It is born from death and possesses extremely potent restorative abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Even a gravely injured mortal, upon inhaling its fragrance, can swiftly recover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo recalled the previous battle scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Cheng Bai had merely taken a breath and quickly recovered, turning severe injuries into minor ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">It must have been due to this precious plant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong sighed, "Every Ghost Gate Escape Grass is a Nascent Soul-level treasure. Cheng Bai's luck is quite good to have obtained this opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"He cultivates Yin-based techniques, so the Ghost Gate Escape Grass is indeed very suitable for him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo counted and found that this cluster of Ghost Gate Escape Grass had seven leaves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"We've struck it rich!" Ning Zhuo said succinctly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The market price of each leaf far exceeded the total cost of the Mechanical Constructs he had expended in battle! Moreover, the leaves were priceless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The disparity among cultivators is immense, and the higher one ascends, the greater the gap, and the same applies to precious plants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Mechanical Constructs Ning Zhuo lost in battle were at most mixed with some Foundation Establishment materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">But the Ghost Gate Escape Grass is a Nascent Soul-level treasure, crucial for life and healing, which greatly elevates its market value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"That's good, Boss Sun, you don't need to worry about the injuries on your physical body anymore," Ning Zhuo said with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong nodded slightly, "It's a pity my mana isn't of the Yin attribute. To make the best use of it, it's best to set up a formation." Every cultivation resource has different methods and effects for different cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">After Sun Ning and Yuan Er carefully placed the Escape Grass, Sun Lingtong continued to search for treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Not long after, he retrieved a set of miniature clothing from Cheng Bai's Qi Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The clothing was only the size of an adult's palm, woven from golden threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The exquisite craftsmanship clearly indicated it was the work of a master tailor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">It was precisely this set of Golden Thread Garments that had formed a protective golden light, rendering Ning Zhuo's Chui Xu Ke's Hanging Death Whip ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Now, the Golden Thread Garments were severely damaged and unusable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Repairing them would be quite troublesome, requiring a high level of tailoring skill in cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong, unable to find any more treasures with the Cloud Smoke Technique, forcibly took a large portion of Cheng Bai's essence blood and poured it into his Blood Gourd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">As a result, Cheng Bai's essence, qi, and spirit were greatly diminished, significantly reducing his threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Underworld Ghost Seal, Soul-Dispersing Rattle Drum, Ghost Gate Escape Grass, and Golden Thread Garments were Cheng Bai's personal treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Three of these were Magical Treasures, and the Ghost Gate Escape Grass was a Nascent Soul-level treasure plant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Only Magical Treasures were qualified to be nurtured in a cultivator's three Dantians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Just like Ning Zhuo's Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his Mountain and Sea Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Cheng Bai, being a true disciple of a major demonic sect, possessed three Magical Treasures and a Nascent Soul-level treasure plant, which was quite a substantial fortune.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">It's worth noting that ordinary Golden Core cultivators mostly used magical artifacts, and even if they had a Magical Treasure, it would usually be just one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Cheng Bai, known as the Blind Judge, was not an ordinary Golden Core cultivator, possessing three Magical Treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Nascent Soul-level treasure plant was invaluable, even coveted by Nascent Soul cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"If it weren't for being in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Meng Kui's Sitting Mountain Observation Technique, and your monkey mechanism, defeating Cheng Bai would have been nearly impossible!" Sun Lingtong sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The battle with Cheng Bai was extremely difficult and risky, but the rewards were immense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The three Magical Treasures and the treasure plant were the main prizes, but Cheng Bai's clothing and accessories, many of which were magical artifacts like storage belts and bracelets, were also valuable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo had already stripped these off in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">As for the treasures hidden in the three seas, Ning Zhuo didn't have the ability to retrieve them yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The contents of the storage belts and other items were also worth looking forward to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">By removing the treasures from the three seas, Sun Lingtong had successfully disarmed Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sun Lingtong was greatly exhausted, his previously rosy complexion turning pale again, and the essence, qi, and spirit he had forcibly gathered plummeted once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Cheng Bai is definitely going to die," Sun Lingtong said. "If he doesn't die, he'll seek revenge on us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"But it's best if we don't kill him ourselves. He's a true disciple and a future high-ranking member of the Soul Devouring Sect. If we kill him, we'll be marked by the Soul Devouring Sect's soul imprint. If the Soul Devouring Sect seeks revenge, we won't be able to withstand it," Sun Lingtong sighed, frowning as he racked his brains on how to deal with Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo then said, "I might have a solution."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Oh? What method?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Let the Lava Immortal Palace kill Cheng Bai!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Sun Lingtong was curious, "What plan do you have?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo, however, did not rush to disclose, "I am not sure if it will work yet. I need to try it first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Boss, forgive me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Huh?" Sun Lingtong was baffled, not understanding what Ning Zhuo was talking about.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Meanwhile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Fire Persimmon Immortal City was already under full lockdown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Chi Dun walked out of the City Lord's mansion disappointedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He had just been with Fei Shi, investigating various records of the formation, but did not get what he wanted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Fei Si said, "The formation on that battlefield was first tampered with by Sun Lingtong using Void Sect's methods. Later, Cheng Bai erased the formation patterns with all his might. It's not surprising that there are no detailed records of the battle with Cheng Bai." Chi Dun nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Although the two despised each other and did not get along, they could still cooperate closely under the City Lord's orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The two Soul Devouring Sect Foundation Establishment Demon Cultivators, Hook-nosed and Triangular-eyed, had already been arrested by the City Lord's mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong, Han Ming, and Chui Xu Ke were all subjected to thorough interrogation, with great intensity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong's black market was essentially finished, while Han Ming's whereabouts were unknown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Sun Lingtong..." Fei Si sighed inwardly, feeling it was a pity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Over the past few years, Sun Lingtong had secretly provided him with considerable benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Fei Si also quite liked someone like Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">It wasn't just about the benefits; Sun Lingtong had truly brought order to the black market, saving Fei Si a lot of trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Chi Dun said, "Previously, Han Ming went missing, probably hiding in some underground base."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"After today's observation, I realized that the gaps in our Fire Persimmon Immortal City's grand formation are so many!" Fei Si pondered, "A full-scale city search is meaningless. I suspect there are quite a few such underground bases."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Why don't we first report to the City Lord and request him to re-establish the Immortal City Grand Formation, doing our best to reduce the gaps between the formations!" Chi Dun thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The two of them went to the mountain peak together to seek an audience with the City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The City Lord was discussing the Immortal City Grand Formation with Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Zhu Xuanji said, "Back when our royal family built the Immortal City Grand Formation here, we took into account the Lava Immortal Palace, so we left a lot of space to avoid the formation's operation interfering with the Lava Immortal Palace." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Meng Kui said, "Now that the Lava Immortal Palace has emerged, if the royal family steps in to rebuild the Immortal City formation..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Zhu Xuanji shook his head, "I didn't come to discuss this with you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"City Lord Meng Kui, if you have any opinions, feel free to report them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"My main purpose here is to inform you to actively cooperate with me. Next, I will enter the Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
