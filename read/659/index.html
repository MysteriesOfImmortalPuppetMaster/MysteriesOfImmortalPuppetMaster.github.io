<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">For a fleeting moment, Ning Zhuo considered invoking the Life Hanging by a Thread technique. He wanted to forcibly restrain Qing Chi and keep her away from the final battleground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">But he quickly sighed, his gaze complex as he awaited her arrival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">On one hand, he deeply understood Qing Chi. Having endured over a decade of hardship in Fire Persimmon Immortal City for his mother's sake, how could he not comprehend her resolve to avenge her father?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">On the other hand, he felt immense guilt toward her. He had impersonated Jiao Ma, deceiving the Ghost Clan girl for a long time, even if his intentions were good, it had been largely for his own purposes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">As for Qing Yan's death...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">What war doesn't claim lives?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"This journey is righteous! It's for the survival and welfare of all living beings in White Paper Immortal City and the Yin Tide Black Marsh Wetlands!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"The Qing Clan has always been aligned with White Paper Immortal City, much like the Jiao Clan, staking everything on its survival. They are the staunchest defenders of the city."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Heaven's Will has favored the Qing Clan, granting them the opportunity to form an army - an immense blessing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Having received such a gift, the Qing-Jiao Army was destined to play a crucial role here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This was no child's play.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and Luo Si were all risking their lives. Meng Yaoyin, the Ash Bone Elder, and others had devoted immense time and effort to meticulously plan and strategize.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">To be honest, considering the scale of their involvement, the Qing-Jiao Army's minimal casualties were a tremendous advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This was the result of Ning Zhuo, Luo Si, and the others giving their all to protect them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Dark clouds churned relentlessly, but compared to before, the formation was no longer so tightly sealed. The cracks widened and multiplied, allowing the Qing-Jiao Army and Qing Chi to pass through easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">More than half of the Heavenly Aspect Formation had already collapsed. Having survived the initial and most perilous phase, Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi could now calmly confront the remaining chaotic currents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">They successfully converged at high altitude and immediately charged into the Altar Battlefield through the passage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Deafening explosions, like unceasing thunder, echoed from within, indicating the fierce battle raging inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The power of the Void Return Black Sphere was extraordinary. Wherever it passed, it left behind a lingering dark residue on the Turbid Qi Barrier. No matter how the Earth Lung Turbid Qi surged, attempting to replenish the barrier, the residual power of the sphere completely neutralized and dissipated it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Thus, the passage remained temporarily stable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Just as they reached the center of the passage, Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi saw Luo Si slowly floating toward them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Overjoyed, they hurried to meet him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The three successfully reunited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Luo Si was in dire straits. After nodding weakly to Ning Zhuo, he closed his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He knew that the Nirvana Buddha Phantom had attacked because of Ning Zhuo's actions. Ning Zhuo hadn't disappointed him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Though they had spent only a short time together, Luo Si's trust in Ning Zhuo was extraordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He had completely abandoned the outside world, entrusting his life and everything he had to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo quickly supported him, lifting him into the air and carrying him along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Luo Si had been severely corroded by the Earth Lung Turbid Qi. His injuries were grave, his Nascent Soul withered and dim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Fortunately, by fully activating his cultivation art, he began generating new spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The spiritual energy rapidly spread, reclaiming the lost ground within his body and gradually expelling the Earth Lung Turbid Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi decided not to rush in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Instead, they retreated from the passage with Luo Si, returning to the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The fighting inside was fierce, and Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi were merely at the Foundation Establishment stage. It was best to observe the situation first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom sat cross-legged, radiating Buddhist Light that pierced through all the turbid qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God seized the opportunity to charge forward, concealed by the thick layer of turbid qi. With a thunderous roar, he swung both fists with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">His punches crackled like thunder, their force as devastating as falling stars!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom countered with a series of gentle palm strikes, dissipating the fiend's attacks and the surrounding turbid qi into nothingness, returning them to stillness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Pfft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God suddenly deflated. A rift tore open in his divine body, releasing torrents of Earth Lung Turbid Qi. The force of the eruption made his divine form tremble violently, his aura withering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Overwhelmed, the fiend was forced into retreat, a dark smoke billowing endlessly from the hole atop his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The dense black smoke coalesced into a viscous, foul-smelling black rain, radiating decay and ruin. It descended upon the Nirvana Buddha Phantom, shrouding him in darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Buddhist Light clashed against the black rain, but the Nirvana Buddha Phantom pressed forward, undeterred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">In his True Form, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord looked anxious, his heart pounding. He instinctively glanced toward the direction of the Forgetful River Immortal City. "Has the message not reached them yet?" he muttered. "It should be happening by now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Meanwhile, in the Forgetful River Immortal City, Zeng Jide was using Theft Path Methods to steal another Earth Lung Nodule when a sudden, unexpected change occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The massive stone before him suddenly trembled violently, emitting a powerful yellow glow. In an instant, the gravity in the area doubled, nearly forcing the old man and child of the Void Sect to their knees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"What's happening?!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed, his voice trembling with uncertainty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zeng Jide observed that within the residual Earth Lung Nodules of the giant stone, one suddenly disintegrated, releasing an immeasurable torrent of pure Earth Element spiritual energy. This massive flow surged through the Formation, vanishing from its origin as it was teleported elsewhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">This Earth Element torrent contained potent Earth Element spiritual energy, vast Earth Lung Turbid Qi, and surging Earth Fiend Power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Though 20% of the energy was lost during transmission, the remaining 80% rapidly infused into the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"ROAR - !!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">As if injected with a powerful stimulant, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God threw his head back and roared to the heavens!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Every wound across his body rapidly healed and regenerated under the torrent's influence, the process so swift it was visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">His previously diminished aura erupted like a volcanic explosion, surging upward until it reached a peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">With frenzied momentum, he once again intercepted the Buddha's phantom on its path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The two clashed in close combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's fists struck like heavenly drums, each blow carrying a vast surge of turbid qi. With every punch, space trembled like fragile cloth, groaning under the strain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom's wooden, lifeless body trembled violently. Countless strands of Buddhist Light were extinguished, its form shattered, dented, and cracked with innumerable fissures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The phantom's body contracted slightly as it spread its arms wide, deploying the Buddha Palm Seal, barely managing to hold its ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Forgetful River Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Hurry! Stay close to me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"The enemy is right here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Surround them! Don't let them escape! The Prefecture Lord's command is to kill them - no matter who they are!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">A swarm of cultivators converged, encircling Zeng Jide and Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Sun Lingtong gasped softly. "Senior, we just took a few things. Why is it like we've disturbed a hornet's nest?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zeng Jide's expression turned grave. "Interesting!" he muttered through gritted teeth. "This stone must be of great importance to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Even as he spoke, his hands never paused in their movements, employing the Theft Path Methods to snatch another stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Pfft!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Far away, on the core battlefield, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, who had just regained its momentum, deflated again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom gained the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier trembled violently as another Earth Lung Nodule disintegrated, transforming into a torrent of Earth Element energy that the Grand Formation channeled away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God rose, opened its mouth, and spat out a beam of yellowish-brown light. Though its range was short, the blast shattered half of the Buddha's phantom shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Zeng Jide retrieved another Earth Lung Nodule.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Pfft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God deflated as the Nirvana Buddha Head Phantom slapped its skull, crushing the entire crown and reducing the black smoke it had emitted by more than half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">Pfft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">Pfft...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's eyes turned bloodshot with fury. No matter who you are, meddling behind my back! he roared inwardly. After this battle, I'll mobilize the nation's full power to hunt you down! I'll flay you alive, grind your bones to dust, and scatter your soul to the winds!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">He had never hated anyone this intensely - not even Yin Jiuzhu or Ning Zhuo. This was too much of a psychological assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's power fluctuated wildly, severely disrupting the Prefecture Lord's rhythm. Even fighting with all his might, he could only delay the Nirvana Buddha Phantom's advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">The Buddha's phantom was also suffering. Most of its power was tied up suppressing the Lord of the Forgetful River Seal. The closer this National Artifact approached the Prefecture Lord's True Form, the more it writhed with agitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">The Buddha's phantom had no choice. It knew it had to secure a swift victory!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">The Buddha's phantom adopted a defensive stance, conserving its strength. Though formidable, its power was like a spring without a source. In contrast, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, though grievously wounded in his True Form, was actively gathering strength for the final battle. The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, meanwhile, could replenish his power endlessly through the Earth Aspect Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Though he also suffered losses, his reserves were ultimately replenished faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's fist crashed into the Buddha's phantom, shattering its form and dimming its Buddhist Light. In return, the Buddha's phantom's palm strike left an indelible mark on the Turbid Filth God's divine body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">The clash between the two forces advanced with a deafening roar, Buddhist Light and Earth Qi locked in a deadly stalemate, their brutal attrition war tearing the very fabric of space into countless shards that scattered like glass across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">At last, the battlefront pushed forward to the banks of the Wangchuan River's tributary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom had shrunk to less than a third of its original size. Its withered Buddha body was riddled with cracks, its shoulders caved in, and its chest sunken. The Buddhist Light had faded, leaving only scattered glimmers of light seeping from its wounds, as if its very essence were dissipating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God was equally battered, staggering on one remaining arm, desperately in need of replenishment. The Buddha's palm strikes had inflicted massive wounds across his body, including one on his back that nearly snapped his spine - a horrifying injury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom pressed his palms together before his chest. Though his lips remained closed, a resonant chant of Silent Extinction reverberated throughout the cosmos, shaking Divine Souls to their core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">Invisible ripples surged outward, not only shattering the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God before him but also striking the Branch of the Wangchuan River, churning its waters into towering waves and terrifying billows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">The Zen sound charged forward like an invisible heavenly blade, nearly cleaving the Branch of the Wangchuan River in two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">What had forced Ning Zhuo to retreat was now easily dispatched by the Nirvana Buddha Phantom in a single move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">"Come," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord roared, his True Form lunging forward with reckless abandon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Having fiercely seized every moment to recuperate, barely able to rest, he had finally amassed enough strength for battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">In an instant, the Branch of the Wangchuan River roared with fury, coalescing into a dragon amidst the raging currents as it lunged toward the Nirvana Buddha Phantom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">The phantom Buddha neither dodged nor retreated. Instead, He parted His palms and spread His arms wide, investing nearly all His combat power into the gesture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">His form dimmed, yet the Silent Extinction Zen intent grew purer and more vast than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Buddhist Dharma: Withered Glory, Shared Sorrow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">As the water-dragon approached the Nirvana Buddha Phantom, it withered like parched vegetation, its power plummeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">The Buddha's phantom, however, radiated an even stronger aura, as if absorbing the power of the flowing water dragons, its might steadily surging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was surrounded by a necromantic glow that pierced the heavens. Behind him, the phantom of the Forgetful River roared and surged. He threw everything he had into the battle, his face solemn and grave as he stared down his formidable enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">The combat power he had painstakingly accumulated, like the relentless waves of water dragons, now surged forth in a torrential flood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">But in the next instant, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God lunged from behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">With a thunderous roar, his divine form collapsed, compressing to an extreme, transforming into a colossal meteor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Boom...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">The meteor streaked forward, burning with dark yellow flames and trailing a long plume of black smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">A self-sacrificial strike!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">The meteor slammed into the Buddha's back, resisted by the blazing Buddhist Light. It slowed, yet inexorably closed the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">The Nirvana Buddha Phantom now faced a pincer attack, besieged from both front and rear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">His Withered Glory, Shared Sorrow could suppress enemies and strengthen himself, but this relentless assault surpassed its transformative limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">The Buddha's form swayed like a candle flame in a gale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">A flicker of triumph flashed in the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's eyes. After this desperate clash, he finally glimpsed a path to victory!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Forgetful River Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Zeng Jide roared and once again unleashed his Lifebound Treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">The Three-Handed Monkey Buddha Statue suddenly blazed with light. The concentrated Buddhist Light coalesced into a monkey paw, which directly grasped the entire massive boulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">In the next instant, Sun Lingtong heard a shrill screech from the monkey head. The monkey paw retracted, dragging the entire boulder back!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Though colossal, the boulder shrank rapidly as it was drawn back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">Finally, Zeng Jide retracted his Lifebound Buddha Statue, now holding a miniature version of the boulder, reduced to a fraction of its original size.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Zeng Jide grunted, his qi plummeting. He held the miniature boulder in one hand and gripped Sun Lingtong's arm with the other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">"Go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">Sun Lingtong's vision exploded into a dazzling kaleidoscope, as if he had plunged into a world of vibrant, swirling colors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">Almost instantly, a group of cultivators from the City Lord's Mansion stormed in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">"Don't let anyone escape... but they're gone?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">The cultivators' faces paled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">At the Altar Battlefield, the Earthly Fiend Meteor suddenly trembled. The once raging dark yellow flames abruptly dimmed, reduced to mere embers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">The highly compressed meteorite rapidly disintegrated into countless fragments, and vast quantities of unrestrained turbid qi scattered wildly in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">The pressure exerted on the Nirvana Buddha Phantom suddenly diminished, allowing it to regain its former glory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">It stepped forward, arms outstretched in an embracing gesture, advancing toward the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">Water Dragons and towering waves relentlessly battered its visage, causing the Buddha's phantom to grow increasingly dim and fractured, its surface cracking in a spiderweb of fissures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord retreated continuously, his face deathly pale, a trace of despair creeping into his expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">His gaze remained sharp, filled with fury, defiance, and resentment, but quickly shifted to hesitation and fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">He knew the situation all too well: he couldn't possibly hold out any longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">If he didn't retreat now, he would be embraced by the Nirvana Buddha Phantom and perish, his path obliterated! The once-mighty Prefecture Lord was about to sacrifice his life in this heaven-defying endeavor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">"Very well, Soundless Ghost Monk. I never expected you to be the ultimate victor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">"The enmity for obstructing my path will never be forgotten! I will remember this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">In the next instant, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord spat out his Origin, activating the Celestial Phenomenon Formation, and was instantly teleported away, vanishing from the scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">With his support gone, the raging torrent reversed, and the Water Dragons exploded in a catastrophic release.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="286">The frontal pressure of the Nirvana Buddha Phantom plummeted as it whirled around to slaughter the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="288">His five fingers spread wide, the Buddha's hand growing larger and larger, as if it were about to encompass all of Heaven and Earth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="290">The Buddha's hand descended, completely covering the Meteor God's body, then clenched into a fist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="292">Boom - !!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
