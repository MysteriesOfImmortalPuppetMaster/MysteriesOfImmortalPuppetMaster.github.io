<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 292: Ning Zhuo vs. Meng Chong</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Bombard the Golden Furnaces?" Ning Zhuo shook his head, decisively refusing the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's suggestion. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Although this is possible for me, the cost is too great! The Golden Furnaces are the essence of the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest. If I bombard it, my merits will be deducted into the negatives again. It's not appropriate, very inappropriate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was anxious, trying its best to persuade, "But it's just the ruins of the Golden Furnaces, young master. The intact Golden Furnaces have strong defenses and might survive the bombardment!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo shook his head again, "You can't be sure of that. It's too risky!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Are we just going to let Zhu Xuanji obtain clues about the Golden Furnaces?!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit glared, unable to understand why Ning Zhuo was so calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo replied, "Calm down, I have already made arrangements. Just watch!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Soon, a large number of mechanical constructs began to mobilize, forming several forces that proactively charged towards the invading Scarlet Flame Beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This scene left Zhu Xuanji and others astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">They had anticipated this phase in advance and had instructed all respecialization team members who received duties from the Command Platform to ignore the defense tasks concerning the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest as much as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhu Xuanji and others quickly contacted the cultivators holding relevant positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">They found that no one had made such a deployment of forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Zhu Xuanji quickly believed their words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The reason was simple: such a large-scale deployment of forces was unprecedented. A cultivator capable of such a feat must hold a very high position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">With the interception of the mechanical constructs, the Scarlet Flame Beasts were blocked at the periphery and unable to approach the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Zhu Xuanji and others were also unable to make a move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo then mobilized the Five Elements Cannon Tower for continuous bombardment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Even though many mechanical constructs were within the bombardment range, Ning Zhuo did not hesitate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After all, these were not cultivators but mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Even if they were destroyed, they could just be rebuilt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In fact, these mechanical constructs, positioned as cannon fodder, only truly fulfilled their value by sacrificing themselves here!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">With the Command Platform deploying forces and the Five Elements Cannon Tower attacking from afar, Ning Zhuo swiftly resolved the crisis in the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zhu Xuanji's hopes were dashed, but he showed no sign of disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He gazed with interest in the direction of the Command Platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After this battle, how could he not understand that the Command Platform had also been infiltrated by the enemy? And the enemy who acted was most likely the Void Sect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"The cultivators secretly controlling all this do not even need to enter the Cannon Tower or the Command Platform to manipulate everything. Do they hold high positions, or have they mastered the loopholes in the Lava Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"No matter who they are, whether they hold high positions or have mastered loopholes, I understand that there must be important clues hidden here! The enemy is wary of my innate talent and the Origin Tracing Technique, so they are doing everything possible to obstruct me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Interesting, hehe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo's actions only further fueled Zhu Xuanji's determination to scour the Golden Furnace ruins for clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit paced about in the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">It breathed a sigh of relief. The pressure in its heart eased somewhat, but it still felt like a giant stone was pressing down it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As long as Zhu Xuanji was not eliminated, or the Golden Furnace ruins not destroyed, its grand plan for freedom was in danger of collapsing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Ning Zhuo was surprisingly reliable this time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"But it's still not stable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Why not just fire the cannon and destroy the Golden Furnace ruins? A decisive blow would be best!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">So, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit contacted Ning Zhuo again, bringing up this suggestion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo shook his head, "I've already handed over the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. If I don't become the palace master, I definitely won't get it back. I must become the master of the Lava Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Once I become the palace master, the entire Lava Immortal Palace will be mine. The Golden Furnace is too valuable; how can I destroy my treasure?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">These words left the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">It couldn't help but think, "What level are you at? You're just at the Qi Refining Stage! What makes you so confident that you can achieve ultimate victory in such a perilous situation?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Ning Zhuo, you're overconfident."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"No, perhaps it's not confidence. This gambler has already lost his mind. He's betting on the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, betting on his life, and he can only gamble on winning in the end!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"This damned gambler!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"You're gambling with your life; don't drag me, the dragon turtle, into it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">At this moment, Ning Zhuo sent another message, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, I need your help! There will definitely be schemes against me emerging one after another."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Since the Lava Immortal Palace is your territory, you need to keep an eye on those who are against me. You must report to me on time!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"If I'm caught off guard, it's your fault." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"You need to perform well and help me win the position of palace master. Have confidence; the future is ours!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit snorted angrily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">It felt that Ning Zhuo was becoming increasingly rude to it. Previously, there was a tone of negotiation, but now it was recieving outright orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"If you really become the palace master, commanding me here and there every day, will I have any good days left?" Just thinking about such a future made even a fire spirit shiver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo continued, "Did you hear me? We must cooperate fully."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"You alert me, and I'll fend off Zhu Xuanji while also preemptively countering any schemes against me." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shouted in frustration, "Such an annoyance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">It took a few deep breaths, then pretended to be weak and agreed to Ning Zhuo's request, while also encouraging him to strive with all his might to win the position of palace master as soon as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The second stage of the palace examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The eighth round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo stepped through the teleportation circle and onto the platform, immediately spotting his opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Today's first opponent was unexpectedly Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Meng Chong also saw Ning Zhuo and gritted his teeth, "It's you! You narrowly won the last few times, but this time, I'll make you taste defeat!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Meng Chong's mechanical skills were very low, and he naturally had a complete losing record against Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands with a smile, "Brother Meng Chong, it's a pleasure to meet you in the first battle today."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Meng Chong waved his hand, "Spare me the useless, hypocritical nonsense. Huh? I can actually see you?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">It was still the preparation phase, but everyone's vision was clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, "It seems today's competition rules have changed slightly." Each round's content would undergo minor changes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Over these days, all the cultivators had become accustomed to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Sure enough, new information came, announcing that this round would not conceal the refining process, allowing others to watch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The palace examination officially began!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Meng Chong dashed to the table, starting to analyze and inspect the materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo, with his hands behind his back, walked slowly to the table, scanning the materials and observing the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">There were many materials, some at the Qi Refining Stage level, others at the Foundation Establishment level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The supply of materials had already evolved continuously from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Innate Talent - Wild Sprint Thunderclap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After completing his inspection, Meng Chong boldly unleashed his most powerful trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">His entire body flickered with electric light, making each of his actions at least twice as fast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Whether melting or cutting, these actions were also accelerated under the influence of his innate talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">In the same amount of time, others could only create one mechanical construct, but Meng Chong could create two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">It was precisely this trump card that allowed him to win more than he lost by fighting two against one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"His innate talent has been developed to such an extent; truly worthy of being a favored child of heaven." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Even though Ning Zhuo had long been aware of Meng Chong's abilities, he couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">One must know that in the process of refining mechanical constructs, many steps and details require meticulous control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Meng Chong achieved this even while doubling his speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">His development of his innate talent had progressed incredibly fast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo clearly remembered that when Meng Chong first used Wild Sprint Thunderclap, he could only charge straight ahead. Unable to stop, his entire construct body crashed into the thread trap, cutting it into countless pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Now, he was at ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"However, you still refuse to use your brain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Today's round isn't about being faster." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo's lips curled slightly, his whole demeanor relaxed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Meng Chong's movements were swift, his progress surpassing Ning Zhuo's, and the entire refining process was clear for Ning Zhuo to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Thus, during Ning Zhuo's refining, he deliberately adjusted his design plan, specifically crafting mechanical components to counter Meng Chong's constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Once the battle began, Ning Zhuo fought two against one, using the mechanical components to counter, and easily won.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Ahhh!" Meng Chong grabbed his hair, somewhat frantic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He had hoped to defeat Ning Zhuo and salvage his reputation after a series of losses, but unexpectedly, this time he lost even more decisively!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Alright, alright, Ning Zhuo! Next time, we'll compete again!" Meng Chong was not discouraged and left harsh words before stepping off the platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">This scene was witnessed by several cultivators below the platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Among them was a member of the Meng family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He frowned, "This Qi Refining Stage junior, Ning Zhuo, seems to be winning a bit too often."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Realizing this, he quickly checked the battle records and was surprised to find that it wasn't his imagination; Ning Zhuo's personal battle record was indeed among the top!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo's previous battles were always close calls, often narrowly winning, which easily led to misunderstandings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">But this time, his decisive victory over Meng Chong made him noticed by those with keen eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">That night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo received bad news â€” multiple security incidents had occurred in the black market. Even though the former stewards of the Ning family collectively mobilized, they suffered counterattacks from the assailants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The black market was in chaos. Various merchants and vendors suffered varying degrees of loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">These people quickly banded together, collectively demanding compensation from the black market!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">In the black market, no one could make a decision. The City Lord's mansion also made an inquiry. Facing such immense pressure, they had no choice but to send a message to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo saw the message and felt a sense of realization, "It seems someone has finally noticed my outstanding battle record." Although he wanted to continue hiding, his exceptional talent in mechanical constructs could no longer be concealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
