<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Seeing the young lady confess her feelings to him like this, Ning Zhuo's eyelids twitched, his first reaction was to turn around and leave!<br/>
<br/>
Trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Big trouble had come knocking on his door.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo observed her words and expressions, and seeing that although Qing Chi looked at him with a pleading and miserable face, there was a heroic spirit hidden between her brows, he secretly suppressed the urge to close the door directly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was very worried that this action would provoke the other party into a frenzy, banging on the door, even shouting: "Open the door, open the door, you have the guts to betray my trust, to become a male concubine, you have the guts to open the door" kind of situation.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, it would be even more troublesome.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes darted around, quickly surveying the surroundings, and had already discovered that many people nearby had noticed this place, and more hidden gazes were cast here.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo decided to first stabilize the young lady in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
He sighed softly and said to Qing Chi: "Qing Chi, stop making a scene for now."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if we can't be together, we still have the bond of being from the same village."<br/>
<br/>
"I will explain it to you properly."<br/>
<br/>
Qing Chi immediately urged: "Then explain, say it, I'm listening."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that her emotions were becoming increasingly agitated, Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head: "No, no, no, now is not a good time, there are many things I can't say in public."<br/>
<br/>
"Alright." Qing Chi said immediately, "Let's go inside and talk!"<br/>
<br/>
How could Ning Zhuo dare to let her into the room, continuing to block the doorway: "I'll send you a flying letter, it's not appropriate to say anything here, after all, this is the Virility Enhancement Courtyard."<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps, when it's convenient for both of us, we can arrange a time and place to properly clarify some things."<br/>
<br/>
Qing Chi's eyes widened, and she said urgently: "It's convenient for me now, when are you convenient? Is tonight okay?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed bitterly: "What a coincidence, my cultivation has reached a critical juncture, and I need to concentrate on breaking through. Qing Chi, you don't want to hinder my cultivation, do you?"<br/>
<br/>
Qing Chi nodded repeatedly: "Of course not. How do you want to break through the critical juncture, I can help you. Let's go inside and talk!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly waved his hand, politely refused, and strongly requested Qing Chi to leave first.<br/>
<br/>
After several rounds of verbal exchanges, Qing Chi was at a loss for words, tears welling up in her eyes, and she stared at Ning Zhuo with hidden resentment: "Little Ma, I can go. But before I leave, I want to hear you call me Qing Qing again."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's scalp tingled, he glanced around, and could only transmit his divine sense: "Qing Qing."<br/>
<br/>
Only then was Qing Chi slightly satisfied, and left full of reluctance: "Little Ma, it hasn't been long since we last met, but talking to you feels like talking to a stranger. I know you've been through a lot. I can go, but please don't forget, send me a flying letter, and arrange a time with me!"<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, alright." Ning Zhuo expended a great deal of effort to finally send the young lady away.<br/>
<br/>
He closed the door, let out a turbid breath, and felt quite exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, however, with the help of the Life Thread, had watched a good show, and chuckled in Ning Zhuo's heart: "Little Zhuo, why didn't you let her in the room to have a good chat."<br/>
<br/>
"Aiya, it's really not good of you to break her heart like this."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said irritably: "I'm not really Jiao Ma, I can't do something like deceiving her feelings."<br/>
<br/>
"Besides, this matter is not that simple."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was taken aback for a moment, then immediately understood Ning Zhuo's meaning.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately frowned: "That's right! Her father, Qing Yan, doesn't want you two to continue dating, and even gave you a heavy gift as a severance."<br/>
<br/>
"The Jiao family is still counting on you to climb up and establish a closer relationship with the City Lord, so naturally, they would never tell Qing Chi your location."<br/>
<br/>
"But Qing Chi not only found the Virility Enhancement Courtyard, but without asking around, she directly found your residence. You know, how long have you just moved into the Virility Enhancement Courtyard?"<br/>
<br/>
"This might be someone with ulterior motives who quietly told Qing Chi."<br/>
<br/>
"Someone is plotting against you, Little Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
"Could it be a traitor?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head: "Not too clear."<br/>
<br/>
"Let me think about how to deal with it!"<br/>
<br/>
He clasped his hands behind his back and paced around the room. After just one circle, he had an idea.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately wrote letters, not to Qing Chi, but to the Jiao Family Head and Qing Yan.<br/>
<br/>
The content of the letters explained the matter of Qing Chi proactively coming to find him, but did not say what they should do.<br/>
<br/>
These two naturally knew very well what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked at the two letters, thought for a moment, and then tore up the one for Qing Yan.<br/>
<br/>
Then, at the end of the letter to the Jiao Family Head, he added a paragraph, asking the Jiao Family Head to write a letter to Qing Yan, explaining the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after sending out the flying letters, there was another knock on the door.<br/>
<br/>
Now, whenever Ning Zhuo heard a knock on the door, his heart would jump.<br/>
<br/>
Both the Jiao Family Head and Qing Chi proactively knocking on his door to visit were, for Ning Zhuo, troublesome.<br/>
<br/>
Who was it this time?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo opened the door and saw an old acquaintance.<br/>
<br/>
The visitor was burly, with a full beard, it was Yang Weida, who had entered the city with him.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida saw Ning Zhuo: "Jiao Ma, you have to be careful, your current situation is too dangerous!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo raised an eyebrow: "What do you mean by that?"<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida's gaze passed over Ning Zhuo's shoulder, looking into the room: "Let's go inside and talk."<br/>
<br/>
Why does everyone want to go inside to talk?<br/>
<br/>
However, Yang Weida was, after all, not the Jiao Family Head, nor a lovestruck young lady. Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and let him into the room.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida: "I happened to see Qing Chi come looking for you. You're not completely muddle-headed, you didn't let her into the room."<br/>
<br/>
"You need to know, you and I are both male concubines, serving the White Paper City Lord."<br/>
<br/>
"If you're dallying around outside, having an affair with someone else, this is a major taboo!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "I also considered this point."<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida said: "No, you haven't considered enough. Have you ever thought that you are being secretly plotted against?"<br/>
<br/>
"Qing Chi's arrival was too coincidental!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately frowned, pretending to be surprised: "Ah, no way? Who would want to harm me?"<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida: "There are many."<br/>
<br/>
"Jiao Ma, you've just arrived at the Virility Enhancement Courtyard, you don't quite understand the situation here."<br/>
<br/>
"I entered the courtyard a little earlier than you and found out that the three most powerful male concubines here are Shen Bing, Chen Sui, and Sun Tiesheng."<br/>
<br/>
"Shen Bing is a native of the Yin Soul Black Marsh wetlands, the youngest son of a pearl farmer. He obtained a mermaid pearl in his childhood and relied on it to step into cultivation. He himself has an ice spirit root and primarily cultivates the Extreme Cold Art."<br/>
<br/>
"Chen Sui is an outsider. During a childhood locust plague, he was traded for grain by his parents, and eventually sold into White Paper Immortal City. He has been here for more than twenty years."<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Tiesheng is a citizen of White Paper Immortal City, the illegitimate son of a blacksmith, and this blacksmith is an important member of the prominent Sun family in the city."<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida gave a brief introduction.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's frown deepened: "So, even though I haven't been here long, I've already been subjected to the suspicion and scheming of these three?"<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida nodded: "Jiao Ma, don't underestimate yourself. Your family's primary cultivation technique is renowned throughout the wetlands, and coupled with your resourceful performance when you were previously framed, you have already caught the City Lord's eye."<br/>
<br/>
"Given some time for you to develop, you will inevitably be their most powerful competitor."<br/>
<br/>
"I understand." Ning Zhuo nodded, cupped his hands towards Yang Weida, expressing his thanks, "I will pay close attention."<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida spoke for a while, and seeing Ning Zhuo's intention to see him out, hurriedly said: "Jiao Ma, although I am an outsider, I came with you, and we are on the same side."<br/>
<br/>
"I won't hide it from you, I'll tell you the truth. I came to you because I want to form an alliance with you."<br/>
<br/>
"With these three people riding on our heads, how can we stand out?"<br/>
<br/>
"Jiao Ma, you've just entered and are already being suppressed by them, what will you do in the future?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned in thought for a moment, looked at Yang Weida and said: "What you said makes sense, I have a close relationship with you, of course we can join forces."<br/>
<br/>
"But what can you help me with?"<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida just smiled.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately waved his hand: "Don't mention anything about the virility enhancement ointment, you know, the higher-ups have distributed more virility enhancement pills."<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida's smile froze instantly, then he gritted his teeth and said: "Although I am just an ordinary traveling merchant, my biological brother is no ordinary person."<br/>
<br/>
"My brother is called Yang Sanyan, he is a Golden Core True Disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, and also a member of the Evil Extermination Hall!"<br/>
<br/>
"This ghost tide is powerful. Even if White Paper Immortal City offers a large sum of money to have cultivators from the surrounding villages and towns come to the city to assist, it will be very difficult to resolve the current predicament."<br/>
<br/>
"So, it is very likely that they will seek external assistance. They have done this several times before."<br/>
<br/>
"And the primary target for assistance is the Myriad Manifestations Sect!"<br/>
<br/>
"At that time, if I can stand out by your side, I can better leverage my brother's power to do many things."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn't help but raise his eyebrows, looking Yang Weida up and down.<br/>
<br/>
He hadn't expected that this person before him would also have such a connection with the Myriad Manifestations Sect.<br/>
<br/>
"My mother is a True Disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Wen Ruanyu is also, how come his brother Yang Sanyan is still... are there so many Golden Core True Disciples in the Myriad Manifestations Sect?"<br/>
<br/>
In the span of a few breaths, Ning Zhuo's thoughts raced.<br/>
<br/>
He said to Yang Weida: "A Golden Core True Disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, that's quite something!"<br/>
<br/>
"There's no problem with us joining forces."<br/>
<br/>
"But I'll tell you beforehand, I have no intention of relying on my status as a male concubine to get ahead."<br/>
<br/>
"Qing Chi and I... indeed have lingering feelings!"<br/>
<br/>
"I myself don't want to gain the City Lord's favor through virility enhancement. I only do so because of my family's interests and orders."<br/>
<br/>
"Once this ghost tide passes, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt, Qing Chi and I will also have a new turning point."<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida said "ah", hesitating: "This..."<br/>
<br/>
"So, when I was at the Hidden Yang manor, I didn't perform at my full potential, but instead exchanged for a lot of spirit food and engaged in soul cultivation," Ning Zhuo said.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida's expression flickered slightly as he recalled, indeed it was so.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo showed him the door: "I still need to continue cultivating, so let's not chat anymore. We can contact each other about subsequent matters."<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida had no choice but to leave Ning Zhuo's residence first.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt puzzled and secretly asked: "Little Zhuo, what exactly are you thinking?"<br/>
<br/>
"You clearly don't want to get involved with Qing Chi, so why did you say that to Yang Weida?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "Do you remember the ointment Yang Weida sold us?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: "Yes, the mechanism ring warned us, there's a problem with that ointment. But Yang Weida himself shouldn't be a problem."<br/>
<br/>
"According to what we knew before, he was suspected of being a savior. So, before even entering the city, he was investigated."<br/>
<br/>
"The Sorrowful Ghost Melody Seer must have done her best to examine him."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "If I were the Lord of the River of Oblivion, or the City Overturning Alliance, I wouldn't dispatch a traitor like a traveling merchant at this juncture."<br/>
<br/>
"But this doesn't mean that Yang Weida has no other suspicions."<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of this, Ning Zhuo's gaze deepened.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said "ah", instantly understanding: "You think this might be Yang Weida's scheme? He secretly leaked the information to let Qing Chi find you?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded slightly: "Yang Weida, as a fellow villager, naturally knows more about the relationship between Jiao Ma and Qing Chi than others."<br/>
<br/>
"He knows even better the power of the Jiao family's primary cultivation technique."<br/>
<br/>
"If he wants to use my strength to counter those three, and uses this trick to force me to ally with him, it's entirely possible."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suddenly understood, finally comprehending why Ning Zhuo's attitude had been inconsistent.<br/>
<br/>
As the saying goes, speak human language to humans, and ghost language to ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong frowned: "Then this situation is very complicated. Who exactly is plotting against you? Is it Yang Weida, or the three people he mentioned, or a traitor?"<br/>
<br/>
"The traitor also has a strong motive to deal with you."<br/>
<br/>
"First, my previous identity as Iron Lump was as your close attendant, and I personally witnessed the traitor's assassination attempt on Jin Yangzi."<br/>
<br/>
"Second, you were favored by the City Lord's avatar and appointed to investigate the traitor. Although you disguised yourself as Wen Ruanyu's subordinate, this identity is enough for the traitor to target you."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled faintly: "I already have an idea."<br/>
<br/>
He proactively contacted Wen Ruanyu.<br/>
<br/>
"I have already thought of a plan, which may induce the traitor to strike again," Ning Zhuo said to Wen Ruanyu directly.<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu's eyes lit up. These past few days, he had also been designing this matter and had many thoughts. He immediately said: "I would like to hear the details."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then briefly described it, causing Wen Ruanyu to frown and remain silent.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo saw through the doubt beneath Wen Ruanyu's expression and proactively revealed: "Do you think this plan is too simple and straightforward?"<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu nodded: "Indeed, I feel so."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled faintly and convinced him with just one sentence: "As long as the plan works, the great Dao is simple. The more complex a plan is, the harder it is to realize, and the more variables it contains. This is an overt scheme! Even if the traitor hesitates, when the Lord of the River of Oblivion's army mobilizes, how can they sit idly by?"<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu clapped his hands and laughed: "Exactly so, Young Master Jiao Ma has thought it through! Let's proceed with this plan."<br/>
<br/>
Thus, that very night, the Virility Enhancement Courtyard implemented a lockdown and announced an important matter – the Virility Enhancement Courtyard would set up a Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation.<br/>
<br/>
This formation was quite classic, capable of lowering the standard for a magic treasure to recognize its owner, reducing the difficulty of refining, and allowing the magic treasure to recognize its owner more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
And the sole target of the Treasure Refining Formation was the Golden Swallow Fork.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever refined the Golden Swallow Fork could activate the immense yang qi within it, allowing the City Lord's main body to recover and resolve the crisis of White Paper Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
And the male concubine who could accomplish this would naturally achieve a monstrous merit and ascend to a high position in one fell swoop!<br/>
<br/>
The Virility Enhancement Courtyard distributed formation flags, so that every male concubine had a formation footing to station themselves at, fully releasing their yang qi, to compete and vie for the identity of the magic treasure's owner.<br/>
<br/>
A night passed.<br/>
<br/>
Early morning.<br/>
<br/>
The courtyard was in an uproar.<br/>
<br/>
"Someone's dead, someone's dead!"<br/>
<br/>
Shen Bing was dead.</div>
