<paragraph index="1">Seeing the young lady confess her feelings to him like this, Ning Zhuo's eyelids twitched, his first reaction was to turn around and leave!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Big trouble had come knocking on his door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo observed her words and expressions, and seeing that although Qing Chi looked at him with a pleading and miserable face, there was a heroic spirit hidden between her brows, he secretly suppressed the urge to close the door directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo was very worried that this action would provoke the other party into a frenzy, banging on the door, even shouting: "Open the door, open the door, you have the guts to betray my trust, to become a male concubine, you have the guts to open the door" kind of situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">At that time, it would be even more troublesome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo's eyes darted around, quickly surveying the surroundings, and had already discovered that many people nearby had noticed this place, and more hidden gazes were cast here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo decided to first stabilize the young lady in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He sighed softly and said to Qing Chi: "Qing Chi, stop making a scene for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Even if we can't be together, we still have the bond of being from the same village."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"I will explain it to you properly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Qing Chi immediately urged: "Then explain, say it, I'm listening."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Seeing that her emotions were becoming increasingly agitated, Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head: "No, no, no, now is not a good time, there are many things I can't say in public."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Alright." Qing Chi said immediately, "Let's go inside and talk!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">How could Ning Zhuo dare to let her into the room, continuing to block the doorway: "I'll send you a flying letter, it's not appropriate to say anything here, after all, this is Vigorous Yang Manor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Perhaps, when it's convenient for both of us, we can arrange a time and place to properly clarify some things."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Qing Chi's eyes widened, and she said urgently: "It's convenient for me now, when are you convenient? Is tonight okay?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo sighed bitterly: "What a coincidence, my cultivation has reached a critical juncture, and I need to concentrate on breaking through. Qing Chi, you don't want to hinder my cultivation, do you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Qing Chi nodded repeatedly: "Of course not. How do you want to break through the critical juncture, I can help you. Let's go inside and talk!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo quickly waved his hand, politely refused, and strongly requested Qing Chi to leave first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">After several rounds of verbal exchanges, Qing Chi was at a loss for words, tears welling up in her eyes, and she stared at Ning Zhuo with hidden resentment: "Little Ma, I can go. But before I leave, I want to hear you call me Qing Qing again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo's scalp tingled, he glanced around, and could only transmit his divine sense: "Qing Qing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Only then was Qing Chi slightly satisfied, and left full of reluctance: "Little Ma, it hasn't been long since we last met, but talking to you feels like talking to a stranger. I know you've been through a lot. I can go, but please don't forget, send me a flying letter, and arrange a time with me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Alright, alright." Ning Zhuo expended a great deal of effort to finally send the young lady away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He closed the door, let out a turbid breath, and felt quite exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun Lingtong, however, with the help of the Life Thread, had watched a good show, and chuckled in Ning Zhuo's heart: "Little Zhuo, why didn't you let her in the room to have a good chat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Aiya, it's really not good of you to break her heart like this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo said irritably: "I'm not really Jiao Ma, I can't do something like deceiving her feelings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Besides, this matter is not that simple."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Sun Lingtong was taken aback for a moment, then immediately understood Ning Zhuo's meaning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He immediately frowned: "That's right! Her father, Qing Yan, doesn't want you two to continue dating, and even gave you a heavy gift as a severance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The Jiao family is still counting on you to climb up and establish a closer relationship with the City Lord, so naturally, they would never tell Qing Chi your location."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"But Qing Chi not only found Vigorous Yang Manor, but without asking around, she directly found your residence. You know, how long have you just moved into Vigorous Yang Manor?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"This might be someone with ulterior motives who quietly told Qing Chi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Someone is plotting against you, Little Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Could it be a traitor?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo shook his head: "Not too clear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Let me think about how to deal with it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He clasped his hands behind his back and paced around the room. After just one circle, he had an idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He immediately wrote letters, not to Qing Chi, but to the Jiao Family Head and Qing Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The content of the letters explained the matter of Qing Chi proactively coming to find him, but did not say what they should do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">These two naturally knew very well what to do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo looked at the two letters, thought for a moment, and then tore up the one for Qing Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Then, at the end of the letter to the Jiao Family Head, he added a paragraph, asking the Jiao Family Head to write a letter to Qing Yan, explaining the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Not long after sending out the flying letters, there was another knock on the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Now, whenever Ning Zhuo heard a knock on the door, his heart would jump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Both the Jiao Family Head and Qing Chi proactively knocking on his door to visit were, for Ning Zhuo, troublesome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Who was it this time?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo opened the door and saw an old acquaintance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The visitor was burly, with a full beard, it was Yang Weida, who had entered the city with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Yang Weida saw Ning Zhuo: "Jiao Ma, you have to be careful, your current situation is too dangerous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo raised an eyebrow: "What do you mean by that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Yang Weida's gaze passed over Ning Zhuo's shoulder, looking into the room: "Let's go inside and talk."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Why does everyone want to go inside to talk?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">However, Yang Weida was, after all, not the Jiao Family Head, nor a lovestruck young lady. Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and let him into the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Yang Weida: "I happened to see Qing Chi come looking for you. You're not completely muddle-headed, you didn't let her into the room."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"You need to know, you and I are both male concubines, serving the White Paper City Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"If you're dallying around outside, having an affair with someone else, this is a major taboo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo nodded: "I also considered this point."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yang Weida said: "No, you haven't considered enough. Have you ever thought that you are being secretly plotted against?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Qing Chi's arrival was too coincidental!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo immediately frowned, pretending to be surprised: "Ah, no way? Who would want to harm me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Yang Weida: "There are many."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Jiao Ma, you've just arrived at Vigorous Yang Manor, you don't quite understand the situation here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"I entered the courtyard a little earlier than you and found out that the three most powerful male concubines here are Shen Bing, Chen Sui, and Sun Tiesheng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Shen Bing is a native of the Yin Soul Black Marsh wetlands, the youngest son of a pearl farmer. He obtained a mermaid pearl in his childhood and relied on it to step into cultivation. He himself has an ice spirit root and primarily cultivates the Extreme Cold Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Chen Sui is an outsider. During a childhood locust plague, he was traded for grain by his parents, and eventually sold into White Paper Immortal City. He has been here for more than twenty years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Sun Tiesheng is a citizen of White Paper Immortal City, the illegitimate son of a blacksmith, and this blacksmith is an important member of the prominent Sun family in the city."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Yang Weida gave a brief introduction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo's frown deepened: "So, even though I haven't been here long, I've already been subjected to the suspicion and scheming of these three?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Yang Weida nodded: "Jiao Ma, don't underestimate yourself. Your family's primary cultivation technique is renowned throughout the wetlands, and coupled with your resourceful performance when you were previously framed, you have already caught the City Lord's eye."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Given some time for you to develop, you will inevitably be their most powerful competitor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"I understand." Ning Zhuo nodded, cupped his hands towards Yang Weida, expressing his thanks, "I will pay close attention."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Yang Weida spoke for a while, and seeing Ning Zhuo's intention to see him out, hurriedly said: "Jiao Ma, although I am an outsider, I came with you, and we are on the same side."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"I won't hide it from you, I'll tell you the truth. I came to you because I want to form an alliance with you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"With these three people riding on our heads, how can we stand out?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Jiao Ma, you've just entered and are already being suppressed by them, what will you do in the future?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo frowned in thought for a moment, looked at Yang Weida and said: "What you said makes sense, I have a close relationship with you, of course we can join forces."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"But what can you help me with?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Yang Weida just smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo immediately waved his hand: "Don't mention anything about the virility enhancement ointment, you know, the higher-ups have distributed more virility enhancement pills."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Yang Weida's smile froze instantly, then he gritted his teeth and said: "Although I am just an ordinary traveling merchant, my biological brother is no ordinary person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"My brother is called Yang Sanyan, he is a Golden Core True Disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, and also a member of the Evil Extermination Hall!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"This ghost tide is powerful. Even if White Paper Immortal City offers a large sum of money to have cultivators from the surrounding villages and towns come to the city to assist, it will be very difficult to resolve the current predicament."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"So, it is very likely that they will seek external assistance. They have done this several times before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"And the primary target for assistance is the Myriad Manifestations Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"At that time, if I can stand out by your side, I can better leverage my brother's power to do many things."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but raise his eyebrows, looking Yang Weida up and down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He hadn't expected that this person before him would also have such a connection with the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"My mother is a True Disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, Wen Ruanyu is also, how come his brother Yang Sanyan is still... are there so many Golden Core True Disciples in the Myriad Manifestations Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">In the span of a few breaths, Ning Zhuo's thoughts raced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He said to Yang Weida: "A Golden Core True Disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, that's quite something!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"There's no problem with us joining forces."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"But I'll tell you beforehand, I have no intention of relying on my status as a male concubine to get ahead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Qing Chi and I... indeed have lingering feelings!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"I myself don't want to gain the City Lord's favor through virility enhancement. I only do so because of my family's interests and orders."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Once this ghost tide passes, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt, Qing Chi and I will also have a new turning point."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Yang Weida said "ah", hesitating: "This..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"So, when I was at the Hidden Yang manor, I didn't perform at my full potential, but instead exchanged for a lot of spirit food and engaged in soul cultivation," Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Yang Weida's expression flickered slightly as he recalled, indeed it was so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo showed him the door: "I still need to continue cultivating, so let's not chat anymore. We can contact each other about subsequent matters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Yang Weida had no choice but to leave Ning Zhuo's residence first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Sun Lingtong felt puzzled and secretly asked: "Little Zhuo, what exactly are you thinking?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"You clearly don't want to get involved with Qing Chi, so why did you say that to Yang Weida?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo: "Do you remember the ointment Yang Weida sold us?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Sun Lingtong: "Yes, the mechanism ring warned us, there's a problem with that ointment. But Yang Weida himself shouldn't be a problem."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"According to what we knew before, he was suspected of being a savior. So, before even entering the city, he was investigated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Sorrowful Ghost Melody Seer must have done her best to examine him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo nodded: "If I were the Lord of the River of Oblivion, or the City Overturning Alliance, I wouldn't dispatch a traitor like a traveling merchant at this juncture."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"But this doesn't mean that Yang Weida has no other suspicions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Speaking of this, Ning Zhuo's gaze deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Sun Lingtong said "ah", instantly understanding: "You think this might be Yang Weida's scheme? He secretly leaked the information to let Qing Chi find you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly: "Yang Weida, as a fellow villager, naturally knows more about the relationship between Jiao Ma and Qing Chi than others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"He knows even better the power of the Jiao family's primary cultivation technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"If he wants to use my strength to counter those three, and uses this trick to force me to ally with him, it's entirely possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Sun Lingtong suddenly understood, finally comprehending why Ning Zhuo's attitude had been inconsistent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">As the saying goes, speak human language to humans, and ghost language to ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Sun Lingtong frowned: "Then this situation is very complicated. Who exactly is plotting against you? Is it Yang Weida, or the three people he mentioned, or a traitor?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"The traitor also has a strong motive to deal with you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"First, my previous identity as Iron Lump was as your close attendant, and I personally witnessed the traitor's assassination attempt on Jin Yangzi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Second, you were favored by the City Lord's avatar and appointed to investigate the traitor. Although you disguised yourself as Wen Ruanyu's subordinate, this identity is enough for the traitor to target you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly: "I already have an idea."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">He proactively contacted Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"I have already thought of a plan, which may induce the traitor to strike again," Ning Zhuo said to Wen Ruanyu directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Wen Ruanyu's eyes lit up. These past few days, he had also been designing this matter and had many thoughts. He immediately said: "I would like to hear the details."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo then briefly described it, causing Wen Ruanyu to frown and remain silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo saw through the doubt beneath Wen Ruanyu's expression and proactively revealed: "Do you think this plan is too simple and straightforward?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Wen Ruanyu nodded: "Indeed, I feel so."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly and convinced him with just one sentence: "As long as the plan works, the great Dao is simple. The more complex a plan is, the harder it is to realize, and the more variables it contains. This is an overt scheme! Even if the traitor hesitates, when the Lord of the River of Oblivion's army mobilizes, how can they sit idly by?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Wen Ruanyu clapped his hands and laughed: "Exactly so, Young Master Jiao Ma has thought it through! Let's proceed with this plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Thus, that very night, Vigorous Yang Manor implemented a lockdown and announced an important matter – Vigorous Yang Manor would set up a Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">This formation was quite classic, capable of lowering the standard for a magic treasure to recognize its owner, reducing the difficulty of refining, and allowing the magic treasure to recognize its owner more quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">And the sole target of the Treasure Refining Formation was the Golden Swallow Fork.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Whoever refined the Golden Swallow Fork could activate the immense yang qi within it, allowing the City Lord's main body to recover and resolve the crisis of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">And the male concubine who could accomplish this would naturally achieve a monstrous merit and ascend to a high position in one fell swoop!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Vigorous Yang Manor distributed formation flags, so that every male concubine had a formation footing to station themselves at, fully releasing their yang qi, to compete and vie for the identity of the magic treasure's owner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">A night passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Early morning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The courtyard was in an uproar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Someone's dead, someone's dead!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Shen Bing was dead.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
