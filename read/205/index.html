<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"If everyone wants to practice privately, feel free to contact each other and arrange sparring sessions. The results will be better," Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and said, "How about this? I'll rent a martial arts arena in the clan's territory for a long term, specifically for your use. Wherever you go, just show your waist token and report your name, and you can use it for free." As soon as he said this, everyone cheered.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo provided convenience and demonstrated various dazzling spells in public to attract his peers to practice actively.<br/>
<br/>
This was very beneficial for them.<br/>
<br/>
Because after the second Dao Gate, they would need to rely on the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique to select the Five Elements Transformation Disk.<br/>
<br/>
The young cultivators, familiar with the previous Five Elements spells, would find this step significantly beneficial. <br/>
<br/>
Those who had laid a solid foundation would find it easier to grasp the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique, and naturally, they would be able to obtain higher quality Five Elements Transformation Disks.<br/>
<br/>
Advantages are accumulated step by step in this way.<br/>
<br/>
"The basic foundation of my power is the branch members of the Ning family. The core of my power is not those former deacons at the Foundation Establishment Stage, nor the former elders like Ning Youfu and Ning Houjun, but these people in front of me." Although others had strong cultivation, they were already set in their ways.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was very clear that the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique was the future! He had already obtained the ninth level of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Although he didn't know much about the Ice Heart Technique, from the external effects, the comprehensive value of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique far surpassed the Ice Heart Technique.<br/>
<br/>
The Ice Heart Technique was only superior in ice-based spells and mental state aspects compared to the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
And the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique was just one of the three supreme techniques.<br/>
<br/>
These people had a future, they admired Ning Zhuo, and they grew and learned together with him, sharing old friendships.<br/>
<br/>
They were still young, full of energy and ideals, unlike the older people who had experienced too much and were hard to motivate.<br/>
<br/>
Just like now, Ning Zhuo merely showcased the dazzling offensive of the Five Elements spells, and these people were already fascinated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo only rented a martial arts arena for them to use for free, and they were already grateful.<br/>
<br/>
The most wonderful part was that Ning Zhuo could control their cultivation by mastering the other two techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo would secretly impart the other two techniques to those he found pleasing, who had sufficient aptitude and had proven their loyalty and talent.<br/>
<br/>
Even if he only imparted the first three levels and not the entire technique, it would still be very helpful for their Foundation Establishment.<br/>
<br/>
By leveraging this layer of techniques, Ning Zhuo could control them, as long as the Lava Immortal Palace didn't leak this information.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued to forge ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Various spells came to him effortlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, he had hidden his abilities, but now he finally showcased a part of them.<br/>
<br/>
His peers were amazed.<br/>
<br/>
"I feel like I don't need to be here at all!" "Brother Zhuo is too strong; he doesn't need us at all." "This is the easiest time I've had exploring the Immortal Palace." "No, we are still useful. At least we handed over the spirit stone rewards we received to Brother Zhuo." "Brother Zhuo, when will you merge? I still want to try!"<br/>
<br/>
When everyone was idle, they couldn't help but reminisce about the times when they assembled the puppet bodies together to break through the barriers.<br/>
<br/>
In those situations, they at least had some sense of participation.<br/>
<br/>
But now, they had all become spectators behind Ning Zhuo, only responsible for cheering and praising.<br/>
<br/>
Many people felt empty and ashamed of not contributing.<br/>
<br/>
The eighth level, the ninth level...<br/>
<br/>
The transfer station, the first Dao Gate...<br/>
<br/>
At the third level of the Dao Gate, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng blocked the way.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo led everyone to fight against Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
The battle was extremely intense.<br/>
<br/>
From the start, Ning Zhuo's side was at a disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng charged around, displaying an extremely strong sense of oppression.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo contributed the most firepower, while his peers went forward one by one, fearlessly entangling Yuan Dasheng. "Quick, entangle this mechanical ape!" "Even if we sacrifice ourselves, as long as we entangle it for a few breaths, Brother Zhuo's spell can hit the ape." "The mechanical ape is too slippery and fast. But if we sacrifice ourselves to entangle it, we have a chance to win!" His peers laughed and sacrificed themselves heroically.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's spells hit Yuan Dasheng, also killing his peers in the process.<br/>
<br/>
His peers laughed heartily before "dying," feeling genuinely happy to provide some help to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Although this wasn't real death, this voluntary contribution and the centripetal force around Ning Zhuo were already beginning to show.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, only two or three people were left, and Ning Zhuo's spirit stone reserves were almost exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Yuan Dasheng stopped.<br/>
<br/>
He let out a low roar and, under the surprised gazes of the Ning family members, slowly retreated, opened the door, and left for the previous level. "This mechanical ape actually retreated on its own?"<br/>
<br/>
Everyone felt like they were in a dream. "Brother Zhuo, stop it!" someone shouted.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head, "I'm already at my limit. Don't chase a desperate enemy." When Yuan Dasheng opened the door and completely left, the remaining Ning family youths suddenly realized.<br/>
<br/>
"We won?!" "We won, we drove away that mechanical ape!!" "Oh my god, we succeeded." Ning Zhuo shook his head, "My spirit stones are almost exhausted. This victory was very lucky." However, the others didn't think so at all.<br/>
<br/>
They looked at Ning Zhuo excitedly, congratulating him with admiring eyes.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Zhuo, Boss, we did it!" "The three-family alliance couldn't drive away this mechanical ape, but we did!!" "In fact, we almost succeeded last time. It was just because Ning Xiaohui stopped me..." Ning Zhuo shook his head, fully seizing the opportunity to deepen the conflict between the main and branch families.<br/>
<br/>
"That time was indeed a pity!" "But I think I prefer this kind of success." "Yes, yes, hahaha, I can't wait to go out and show off. We defeated the mechanical ape!" Ning Zhuo shook his head again, "We didn't completely defeat it; it retreated on its own." "I think this should be the arrangement of the Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
"As long as our strength is within a certain range and we cause a certain standard of damage to the mechanical ape, it will retreat on its own." "Let's keep moving forward." Ning Zhuo's calm and unassuming demeanor made everyone suppress their inner excitement and follow Ning Zhuo wholeheartedly.<br/>
<br/>
After defeating the mechanical ape, Ning Zhuo didn't show a trace of a smile.<br/>
<br/>
This general-like demeanor made the remaining people secretly admire him.<br/>
<br/>
Little did they know, Ning Zhuo was calculating the repair cost of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
He hadn't figured out this mechanical body yet.<br/>
<br/>
Repairing the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng required the materials and tools provided in the trial levels.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was worried that excessive use of external materials might be considered foreign objects by the Lava Immortal Palace and not be accepted into the palace.<br/>
<br/>
In short, repairing the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was definitely a troublesome task at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
With the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng gone, the path ahead was smooth.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after, Ning Zhuo led the remaining people to the second transfer hall, the place where Meng Chong had arrived.<br/>
<br/>
They only saw one door.<br/>
<br/>
He touched the second Dao Gate and exclaimed, "It's the follow-up technique!" Then, the others stepped forward to touch the door.<br/>
<br/>
After obtaining the technique, they compared with each other and found that they were all the same.<br/>
<br/>
"We did it!" "We got the follow-up technique!" "So, Meng Chong only reached here as well. The reformation team from the City Lord's Mansion also recently started practicing the follow-up technique." Everyone was extremely excited.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, they had been stuck at the third level of Qi Refining for many days and finally had the follow-up technique, which was indescribably exciting.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, they finally saw the backs of the leaders and were surprised to find that Meng Chong and others were not far ahead of them!<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, morale was thus ignited. "Without the peak of the sixth level, we can't open this door." "No wonder the reformation team from the City Lord's Mansion is all focused on cultivation!" "Let's hurry back and seize the time to practice like crazy!!"<br/>
<br/>
"Everyone," Ning Zhuo suddenly said, "please keep the follow-up technique strictly confidential and let me handle the external negotiations, okay?" The remaining people had no objections.<br/>
<br/>
They expressed that this exploration was a great success, all thanks to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
They only played a minor role as cannon fodder in the final battle.<br/>
<br/>
Everything was left to Ning Zhuo to handle.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo and others returned to their bodies with the follow-up technique and returned to the clan's territory, the entire Ning family high-level was almost moved! "Is this really true?!" "This junior Ning Zhuo... indeed has some skills."<br/>
<br/>
The clan leader and many elders of the main family did not expect such a situation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was a talent that emerged later in the family, whose aptitude had not yet been tested, but he repeatedly performed excellently in exploring the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
This achievement completely solidified Ning Zhuo's position.<br/>
<br/>
Even the main family of the Ning family had to admit that Ning Zhuo was indeed the pillar of the reformation team! The true core figure!<br/>
<br/>
The main family and the clan leader of the Ning family had very complicated feelings.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, they would have started suppressing the geniuses of the branch family until the geniuses submitted.<br/>
<br/>
But now, Ning Zhuo relied on the Lava Immortal Palace, forcing them to tolerate and appease Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, they underestimated Ning Zhuo too much, resulting in a blunder, and the young clan leader fell and became a prisoner.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the old ancestor of the Ning family, Ning Jiufan, had publicly acknowledged Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Ning Zhuo also controlled the black market and had many Foundation Establishment elites under his command. "His power is too great to control. There must be a high-level person guiding Ning Zhuo from behind!" "The two old guys from the branch family must be playing some important role..."<br/>
<br/>
The clan leader and the main family of the Ning family were anxious and uneasy.<br/>
<br/>
But they could only do so much.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo voluntarily visited the clan leader of the Ning family and handed over the follow-up technique as agreed.<br/>
<br/>
He made a request, "Next, I want to focus on cultivation. I heard that there is a Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman in the clan that carries spirituality and can help cultivators practice together with excellent results. According to the agreement, please grant me this talisman, Clan Leader."<br/>
<br/>
The clan leader of the Ning family nodded slightly, "Okay." "The Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman is with Ning Xiaohui. I will have someone retrieve it today, and you can come to me tomorrow to receive it."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued, "My cultivation speed is already fast, and with this talisman, it will be like adding wings to a tiger. But rapid cultivation also has its drawbacks." The clan leader of the Ning family thought there was no need to hide anything and directly said, "There is a talisman called the Profound Ice Pure Snow Talisman."<br/>
<br/>
"This talisman is similar to the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, both of which have absorbed some natural spirituality. When activated, the cultivator will be frozen, and regardless of which dantian is being cultivated, the impurities will be frozen and eliminated."<br/>
<br/>
The clan leader of the Ning family explained that these two talismans were very precious and that the usage times should be strictly limited to prevent the spirituality within the talismans from being exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought of the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra. "Can I use this sutra to increase the spirituality of these two talismans?"</div>
