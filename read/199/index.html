<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Underground Base.<br/>
<br/>
Ghostly Whirlpool.<br/>
<br/>
"Who's there?!" Chi Han noticed the disturbance and hurriedly circled around.<br/>
<br/>
But he only saw a vague, massive figure diving headfirst into the ghostly mist without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Han approached the ghostly mist slightly, and immediately, a surge of lust filled his heart.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly stopped in his tracks.<br/>
<br/>
"I should set up a formation around the ghostly mist, encircle it, and seal off the surroundings!" Chi Han gritted his teeth in frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, his abilities were insufficient.<br/>
<br/>
He was a body cultivator with poor proficiency in formations.<br/>
<br/>
Setting up a formation was more challenging for him than charging into battle.<br/>
<br/>
"After the recruitment order, a large number of outsiders flooded into Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Hmph, who knows how many more big rats are hiding in the shadows!" Yuan Dasheng's movements were too fast, leaving Chi Han without even a glimpse of his back.<br/>
<br/>
The ghostly mist had little effect on Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the main pressure was on Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had a Life-Hanging Thread above his head, and so did Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Especially the latter, whose Life-Hanging Thread was the most solid, sturdy, and tangible one planted by Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, even though the ghostly mist reformed, Ning Zhuo did not lose contact with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
However, the scene Ning Zhuo had imagined, where Sun Lingtong was being tortured, severely injured, and on the brink of death, did not appear.<br/>
<br/>
In reality, Sun Lingtong was tightly embraced by Yang Chanyu, their bodies pressed together.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu's face was flushed, she was giggling foolishly, her eyes were seductive, and drool was dripping from the corner of her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, on the other hand, was struggling to breathe, struggling desperately but unable to break free, only passively resisting Yang Chanyu's Yin-Yang Absorption Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was stunned for a few breaths before he reacted.<br/>
<br/>
"Vicious and ruthless!"<br/>
<br/>
"Sun Laoda practices the Pure Yang Body technique. If he loses his purity, not only will his cultivation be drained, but years of effort will be wasted, and his foundation will be severely damaged. He has innate talent and cultivation potential. If he loses his purity and gets injured, his cultivation talent will also be affected, possibly turning him into a cripple!" Ning Zhuo's heart surged with anger.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong being schemed against like this made him angrier than if he himself had been targeted!<br/>
<br/>
But just as Ning Zhuo was about to command Yuan Dasheng to act, Sun Lingtong said, "Don't kill her!"<br/>
<br/>
"This ghostly mist is transformed from a Nascent Soul stage arm, and Yang Chanyu is bearing the brunt of the pressure."<br/>
<br/>
"She is like the only beam supporting a collapsing house. If she is removed, the house will collapse, and I won't have time to escape and will be buried alive."<br/>
<br/>
"Brother, I'm only at the Foundation Establishment stage. My body is too weak to resist Nascent Soul stage methods!" Ning Zhuo was taken aback and quickly asked, "Laoda, what should I do? Tell me."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong replied, "Lend me some Yang energy. She wants to absorb Yang energy, so let her absorb it."<br/>
<br/>
"Hurry, hurry, hurry!"<br/>
<br/>
"I have a Pure Yang Body, naturally resistant to any seductive techniques, with high resistance. Even so, with Yang Chanyu's frantic absorption, I'm barely holding on."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, Laoda, you must not lose your purity!" Ning Zhuo quickly adjusted himself, sending a stream of Yang energy through the Life-Hanging Thread.<br/>
<br/>
The Life-Hanging Thread between him and Sun Lingtong was not strong enough, severely interfered with by the ghostly mist, almost cutting off communication.<br/>
<br/>
But Yuan Dasheng and Ning Zhuo's connection was extremely close and stable.<br/>
<br/>
The Life-Hanging Thread itself could transmit information and power.<br/>
<br/>
Back when Ning Zhuo extracted a trace of power from the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, it was through the Life-Hanging Thread into the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The Life-Hanging Thread could also transmit mana, similar to puppet strings.<br/>
<br/>
Yang energy and Yin energy, being the energies of the two poles, could flow through the Life-Hanging Thread.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo first transferred Yang energy to Yuan Dasheng, who then placed his palm on Sun Lingtong's back, directly transmitting it to him.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu suddenly made a hoarse sound, her eyes shining brightly.<br/>
<br/>
After painstakingly absorbing for so long, she finally absorbed some Yang energy!<br/>
<br/>
Her foolish smile faded slightly, but soon returned to its original state.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong complained, "Brother, why is your Yang energy so little? Send more."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "But, I've already given my all."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong realized, "Oh, I haven't taught you this. Here, I'll teach you a technique specifically for extracting Yang energy."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong gave a brief oral instruction, which Yuan Dasheng listened to first.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng then transmitted it to Ning Zhuo through their Life-Hanging Thread.<br/>
<br/>
The technique was simple and easy to understand, indeed improving the extraction of Yang energy.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was quick to grasp it, and after learning it, he immediately applied it, extracting more than ten times the Yang energy he had before.<br/>
<br/>
However, the young cultivator's expression was somewhat strange, and he couldn't help but ask, "Laoda, you practice the Pure Yang Body technique. How did you learn this method for extracting Yang energy from the body?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong did not answer but said, "The Dao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, three gives birth to all things. All things carry Yin and embrace Yang, and through the blending of Qi, harmony is achieved."<br/>
<br/>
"All things in heaven and earth evolve through the interplay of Yin and Yang."<br/>
<br/>
"This is your opportunity, Little Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "Laoda, what do you mean?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said, "It is said that solitary Yin does not grow, and solitary Yang does not develop."<br/>
<br/>
"Without Yang, Yin cannot be born; without Yin, Yang cannot transform. Dual cultivation of Yin and Yang, the interplay of the two energies, has always been the grand path of cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
"At this moment, you can dual cultivate with Yang Chanyu, mutually generating Yin and Yang, enhancing your cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "What?!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong continued, "Brother, look."<br/>
<br/>
"Yang Chanyu has lost her mind, influenced by the ghostly mist, and instinctively used the Yin-Yang Absorption Technique."<br/>
<br/>
"Later, I will use your Yang energy to perform the corresponding Yin-Yang Absorption Technique. This way, the Yin and Yang will cycle, and your cultivation will soar!"<br/>
<br/>
"This opportunity is truly once in a lifetime!"<br/>
<br/>
"If Yang Chanyu were rational, she would never do this. She is at the Golden Core stage, and you are merely at the Qi Refining stage. Dual cultivating with you would be a huge loss for her."<br/>
<br/>
"Conversely, you would gain immensely."<br/>
<br/>
"Wait!" Ning Zhuo interrupted, "Laoda, you still haven't told me how you know the techniques for extracting Yang energy and the Yin-Yang Absorption Technique."<br/>
<br/>
"Fine, I'll tell you!" Sun Lingtong said, "Our Void Sect's principle is to steal from heaven, earth, and all things. The essence, Qi, and spirit of cultivators are also within the scope of theft."<br/>
<br/>
"And to steal these treasures, naturally, one must practice these techniques."<br/>
<br/>
"Most disciples of the Void Sect have learned these kinds of techniques."<br/>
<br/>
"Hurry, your Yang energy is running low again, send more."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo complied, sending another stream, but his actions were noticeably hesitant.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he came to rescue Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
But now, how did it turn into him dual cultivating with Yang Chanyu!<br/>
<br/>
This was far beyond his expectations.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, knowing Ning Zhuo well, immediately sensed his thoughts and reassured him, "Little Zhuo, what are you worried about?"<br/>
<br/>
"The union of Yin and Yang is the righteous path of heaven and earth, the royal road of cultivation!"<br/>
<br/>
"The Dao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two. Heaven is Yang, earth is Yin. It is the interplay of Yin and Yang that creates heaven and earth!"<br/>
<br/>
"Men are Yang, women are Yin. The union of Yin and Yang gives rise to the flourishing life of all races."<br/>
<br/>
"In Buddhism, there is the practice of joy, emphasizing the dual cultivation of emptiness and joy, specifically referring to the dual cultivation of men and women, the union of Yin and Yang, achieving purification of body and mind and perfect wisdom."<br/>
<br/>
"In Daoism, it is said that 'Yang energy moves to generate Yin, Yin energy remains still to form Yang.' Through cultivation, one can make the Yang energy within move to generate Yin, and the Yin energy remain still to form Yang, achieving harmony of Yin and Yang."<br/>
<br/>
"Many techniques involve absorbing the Yang energy of the morning sun, noon, and dusk, and the Yin energy of the full moon night, extracting the Yin and Yang energies from nature to aid in cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
"The union of Yin and Yang is extremely common, running through a cultivator's life. You are not using your Pure Yang Body to unite with Yang Chanyu's Pure Yin Body, just some Yang and Yin energy, what's the harm?"<br/>
<br/>
"It's just like when you collaborated with Zheng Jie to refine the Tree Martial Ape mechanism. No harm, no harm at all!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, persuaded by Sun Lingtong, continued to transmit Yang energy.<br/>
<br/>
The Yang and Yin energies intertwined between Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu, forming a tightly bound Yin-Yang sphere.<br/>
<br/>
The sphere rotated continuously, consuming the Yin and Yang energies intensely, producing a mysterious and wondrous Two Elements Qi.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu, having lost her mind, did not notice, but Sun Lingtong did.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately extracted the Two Elements Qi, channeling it to Yuan Dasheng, leaving none for Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng, through his Life-Hanging Thread, transmitted the Two Elements Qi to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The moment the Two Elements Qi entered his body, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but take a deep breath, showing a look of awe.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn't need to cultivate; he felt the rapid consumption of the Two Elements Qi, while his essence, Qi, and spirit surged wildly!<br/>
<br/>
His cultivation in the three treasures was at the early stage of the seventh level.<br/>
<br/>
With the consumption of the Two Elements Qi, his cultivation surged forward like a river, advancing to the mid-seventh level.<br/>
<br/>
"Amazing, truly amazing!" Ning Zhuo felt a sense of awe.<br/>
<br/>
This cultivation speed was unprecedented, far beyond anything he had seen or heard of, more than a thousand miles a day!<br/>
<br/>
"Right, the Perfect Harmony Talisman!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly used three Perfect Harmony Talismans on himself, synchronizing the advancement of his essence, Qi, and spirit.<br/>
<br/>
He continuously consumed Yang energy, obtaining the Two Elements Qi.<br/>
<br/>
Mid-seventh level!<br/>
<br/>
In just a short while, Ning Zhuo advanced to the next minor realm.<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that he had just recently broken through to the seventh level.<br/>
<br/>
In the later stages, the three methods pursued scale, expanding more than three times compared to before.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, Ning Zhuo would need to cultivate three times as long to achieve the same progress as before.<br/>
<br/>
But now, he had reached the mid-seventh level.<br/>
<br/>
"It was like a single step to the heavens."<br/>
<br/>
And this was just the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Late-seventh level.<br/>
<br/>
Peak-seventh level.<br/>
<br/>
Eighth level!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's body trembled, and his cultivation in the three treasures simultaneously broke through, advancing to the eighth level.<br/>
<br/>
"Fortunately, I had previously comprehended the essence of the eighth level's techniques, knowing how to operate them." Ning Zhuo felt a great sense of relief.<br/>
<br/>
The Two Elements Qi continued to be transmitted back, dissolving and dispersing in his three Dantian.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's cultivation continued to rise.<br/>
<br/>
Early-eighth level.<br/>
<br/>
Mid-eighth level.<br/>
<br/>
Late-eighth level.<br/>
<br/>
Peak-eighth level!<br/>
<br/>
