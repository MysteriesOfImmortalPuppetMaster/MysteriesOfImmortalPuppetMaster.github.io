<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 199: Dual Cultivation of Yin and Yang</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Underground Base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ghostly Whirlpool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Who's there?!" Chi Han noticed the disturbance and hurriedly circled around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">But he only saw a vague, massive figure diving headfirst into the ghostly mist without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Chi Han approached the ghostly mist slightly, and immediately, a surge of lust filled his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He quickly stopped in his tracks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"I should set up a formation around the ghostly mist, encircle it, and seal off the surroundings!" Chi Han gritted his teeth in frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Unfortunately, his abilities were insufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He was a body cultivator with poor proficiency in formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Setting up a formation was more challenging for him than charging into battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"After the recruitment order, a large number of outsiders flooded into Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Hmph, who knows how many more big rats are hiding in the shadows!" Yuan Dasheng's movements were too fast, leaving Chi Han without even a glimpse of his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The ghostly mist had little effect on Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In fact, the main pressure was on Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sun Lingtong had a Life Hanging by a Thread above his head, and so did Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Especially the latter, whose Life Hanging by a Thread was the most solid, sturdy, and tangible one planted by Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Therefore, even though the ghostly mist reformed, Ning Zhuo did not lose contact with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">However, the scene Ning Zhuo had imagined, where Sun Lingtong was being tortured, severely injured, and on the brink of death, did not appear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In reality, Sun Lingtong was tightly embraced by Yang Chanyu, their bodies pressed together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Yang Chanyu's face was flushed, she was giggling foolishly, her eyes were seductive, and drool was dripping from the corner of her mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Sun Lingtong, on the other hand, was struggling to breathe, struggling desperately but unable to break free, only passively resisting Yang Chanyu's Yin-Yang Absorption Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo was stunned for a few breaths before he reacted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Vicious and ruthless!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Sun Laoda practices the Pure Yang Body technique. If he loses his purity, not only will his cultivation be drained, but years of effort will be wasted, and his foundation will be severely damaged. He has innate talent and cultivation potential. If he loses his purity and gets injured, his cultivation talent will also be affected, possibly turning him into a cripple!" Ning Zhuo's heart surged with anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Sun Lingtong being schemed against like this made him angrier than if he himself had been targeted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">But just as Ning Zhuo was about to command Yuan Dasheng to act, Sun Lingtong said, "Don't kill her!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"This ghostly mist is transformed from a Nascent Soul stage arm, and Yang Chanyu is bearing the brunt of the pressure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"She is like the only beam supporting a collapsing house. If she is removed, the house will collapse, and I won't have time to escape and will be buried alive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Brother, I'm only at the Foundation Establishment stage. My body is too weak to resist Nascent Soul stage methods!" Ning Zhuo was taken aback and quickly asked, "Laoda, what should I do? Tell me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong replied, "Lend me some Yang energy. She wants to absorb Yang energy, so let her absorb it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Hurry, hurry, hurry!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"I have a Pure Yang Body, naturally resistant to any seductive techniques, with high resistance. Even so, with Yang Chanyu's frantic absorption, I'm barely holding on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Yes, Laoda, you must not lose your purity!" Ning Zhuo quickly adjusted himself, sending a stream of Yang energy through the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Life Hanging by a Thread between him and Sun Lingtong was not strong enough, severely interfered with by the ghostly mist, almost cutting off communication.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But Yuan Dasheng and Ning Zhuo's connection was extremely close and stable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Life Hanging by a Thread itself could transmit information and power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Back when Ning Zhuo extracted a trace of power from the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, it was through the Life Hanging by a Thread into the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Life Hanging by a Thread could also transmit mana, similar to puppet strings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Yang energy and Yin energy, being the energies of the two poles, could flow through the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo first transferred Yang energy to Yuan Dasheng, who then placed his palm on Sun Lingtong's back, directly transmitting it to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Yang Chanyu suddenly made a hoarse sound, her eyes shining brightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">After painstakingly absorbing for so long, she finally absorbed some Yang energy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Her foolish smile faded slightly, but soon returned to its original state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lingtong complained, "Brother, why is your Yang energy so little? Send more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo: "But, I've already given my all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Lingtong realized, "Oh, I haven't taught you this. Here, I'll teach you a technique specifically for extracting Yang energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sun Lingtong gave a brief oral instruction, which Yuan Dasheng listened to first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Yuan Dasheng then transmitted it to Ning Zhuo through their Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The technique was simple and easy to understand, indeed improving the extraction of Yang energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo was quick to grasp it, and after learning it, he immediately applied it, extracting more than ten times the Yang energy he had before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">However, the young cultivator's expression was somewhat strange, and he couldn't help but ask, "Laoda, you practice the Pure Yang Body technique. How did you learn this method for extracting Yang energy from the body?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong did not answer but said, "The Dao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, three gives birth to all things. All things carry Yin and embrace Yang, and through the blending of Qi, harmony is achieved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"All things in heaven and earth evolve through the interplay of Yin and Yang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"This is your opportunity, Little Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo: "Laoda, what do you mean?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong said, "It is said that solitary Yin does not grow, and solitary Yang does not develop."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Without Yang, Yin cannot be born; without Yin, Yang cannot transform. Dual cultivation of Yin and Yang, the interplay of the two energies, has always been the grand path of cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"At this moment, you can dual cultivate with Yang Chanyu, mutually generating Yin and Yang, enhancing your cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo: "What?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sun Lingtong continued, "Brother, look."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Yang Chanyu has lost her mind, influenced by the ghostly mist, and instinctively used the Yin-Yang Absorption Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Later, I will use your Yang energy to perform the corresponding Yin-Yang Absorption Technique. This way, the Yin and Yang will cycle, and your cultivation will soar!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"This opportunity is truly once in a lifetime!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"If Yang Chanyu were rational, she would never do this. She is at the Golden Core stage, and you are merely at the Qi Refining stage. Dual cultivating with you would be a huge loss for her."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Conversely, you would gain immensely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Wait!" Ning Zhuo interrupted, "Laoda, you still haven't told me how you know the techniques for extracting Yang energy and the Yin-Yang Absorption Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Fine, I'll tell you!" Sun Lingtong said, "Our Void Sect's principle is to steal from heaven, earth, and all things. The essence, Qi, and spirit of cultivators are also within the scope of theft."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"And to steal these treasures, naturally, one must practice these techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Most disciples of the Void Sect have learned these kinds of techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Hurry, your Yang energy is running low again, send more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo complied, sending another stream, but his actions were noticeably hesitant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">After all, he came to rescue Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But now, how did it turn into him dual cultivating with Yang Chanyu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This was far beyond his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Sun Lingtong, knowing Ning Zhuo well, immediately sensed his thoughts and reassured him, "Little Zhuo, what are you worried about?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"The union of Yin and Yang is the righteous path of heaven and earth, the royal road of cultivation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"The Dao gives birth to one, one gives birth to two. Heaven is Yang, earth is Yin. It is the interplay of Yin and Yang that creates heaven and earth!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Men are Yang, women are Yin. The union of Yin and Yang gives rise to the flourishing life of all races."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"In Buddhism, there is the practice of joy, emphasizing the dual cultivation of emptiness and joy, specifically referring to the dual cultivation of men and women, the union of Yin and Yang, achieving purification of body and mind and perfect wisdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"In Daoism, it is said that 'Yang energy moves to generate Yin, Yin energy remains still to form Yang.' Through cultivation, one can make the Yang energy within move to generate Yin, and the Yin energy remain still to form Yang, achieving harmony of Yin and Yang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Many techniques involve absorbing the Yang energy of the morning sun, noon, and dusk, and the Yin energy of the full moon night, extracting the Yin and Yang energies from nature to aid in cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"The union of Yin and Yang is extremely common, running through a cultivator's life. You are not using your Pure Yang Body to unite with Yang Chanyu's Pure Yin Body, just some Yang and Yin energy, what's the harm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"It's just like when you collaborated with Zheng Jie to refine the Tree Martial Ape mechanism. No harm, no harm at all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo, persuaded by Sun Lingtong, continued to transmit Yang energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Yang and Yin energies intertwined between Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu, forming a tightly bound Yin-Yang sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The sphere rotated continuously, consuming the Yin and Yang energies intensely, producing a mysterious and wondrous Two Elements Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Yang Chanyu, having lost her mind, did not notice, but Sun Lingtong did.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He immediately extracted the Two Elements Qi, channeling it to Yuan Dasheng, leaving none for Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Yuan Dasheng, through his Life Hanging by a Thread, transmitted the Two Elements Qi to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The moment the Two Elements Qi entered his body, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but take a deep breath, showing a look of awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo didn't need to cultivate; he felt the rapid consumption of the Two Elements Qi, while his essence, Qi, and spirit surged wildly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">His cultivation in the three treasures was at the early stage of the seventh level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">With the consumption of the Two Elements Qi, his cultivation surged forward like a river, advancing to the mid-seventh level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Amazing, truly amazing!" Ning Zhuo felt a sense of awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">This cultivation speed was unprecedented, far beyond anything he had seen or heard of, more than a thousand miles a day!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Right, the Perfect Harmony Talisman!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo quickly used three Perfect Harmony Talismans on himself, synchronizing the advancement of his essence, Qi, and spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He continuously consumed Yang energy, obtaining the Two Elements Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Mid-seventh level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In just a short while, Ning Zhuo advanced to the next minor realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">It should be noted that he had just recently broken through to the seventh level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">In the later stages, the three methods pursued scale, expanding more than three times compared to before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Normally, Ning Zhuo would need to cultivate three times as long to achieve the same progress as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">But now, he had reached the mid-seventh level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"It was like a single step to the heavens."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">And this was just the beginning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Late-seventh level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Peak-seventh level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Eighth level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo's body trembled, and his cultivation in the three treasures simultaneously broke through, advancing to the eighth level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Fortunately, I had previously comprehended the essence of the eighth level's techniques, knowing how to operate them." Ning Zhuo felt a great sense of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Two Elements Qi continued to be transmitted back, dissolving and dispersing in his three Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo's cultivation continued to rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Early-eighth level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Mid-eighth level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Late-eighth level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Peak-eighth level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
