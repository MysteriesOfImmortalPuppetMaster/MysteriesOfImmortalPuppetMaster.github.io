<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 389: Go Wild, Carbon! The Five Elements Realm!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Five Elements Lord changed forms continuously, displaying various manifestations of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth before Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Green wood, red fire, yellow earth, white metal, black water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Wood had the three-legged golden crow perching on the Fusang village, the sky-reaching Jianmu tree, the life-extending Ruotao, and the phoenix-resting Wutong tree...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Fire had the intense South Ming Lifire, the inextinguishable Samadhi True Fire, the civilizing Liaoren Fire, the karmic Red Lotus Karma Fire, the alchemical treasure Eight Trigrams Furnace Fire...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Earth had the endless Xirang soil, the heaven-mending five-colored stone, the eternally fertile Houtu, the sacred Kuncang earth...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Metal had the supreme forging Kunlun metal, the royal authority Xuanyuan metal, the otherworldly power of star-fallen iron...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Water had the all-engulfing Ruoshui, the star-studded Celestial River, the clear Jingwei water, the life-extending Penglai Immortal Spring...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">These various treasures were the essence and limits of the Five Elements, representing the principles of each element.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Because so many principles were gathered, some cultivators who witnessed these objects generated true understanding in their spirit seas, comprehending the corresponding principles. Of course, this was strongly related to the cultivator's enlightenment ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo observed the various Five Elements treasures, quickly mastering the manifestations of the Five Elements. His Five Elements realm thus advanced to the ordinary level of great accomplishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Five Elements Lord's transformations continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This round, he no longer manifested the physical forms of the Five Elements treasures, but various conceptual and virtual images.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The white radiance of the metal element sometimes appeared like the edge of a sword, the blade of a knife, piercing, chopping, cutting, and slicing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo understood from this that the nature of metal was hardness, governing execution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The green light of the wood element spread like vines, grew like grass leaves, from tiny to robust, then to greatness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo realized that the nature of wood was growth, representing development and vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The ink-like flow of the water element sometimes transformed into towering waves wanting to engulf everything, sometimes spread out calmly without ripples, sometimes became a babbling brook, and sometimes a still pond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo gained some understanding that the nature of water was compliance, governing change, able to overcome hardness with softness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The flame strands of the fire element transformed into lamp fire, seemingly soft and small, yet still able to burn moths. They became raging fires, spreading fiercely, and became radiance, illuminating all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo then understood that the nature of fire was intensity, it was light, it was heat, it was moving forward without looking back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The yellow light of the earth element solidified into blocks, stone blocks piled up to become mountains. Mountains collapsed, turning into a vast expanse of land, boundless and profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo then realized the nature of earth was heaviness. It bore everything, being the foundation of all things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo's seven apertures slowly oozed blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The characteristics and personalities of the Five Elements allowed him to directly advance his Five Elements realm from the ordinary level to the master level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">His mastery of the Five Elements became more profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Five Elements Lord laughed heartily, pointing at Ning Zhuo: "Kid, you've comprehended to this extent, your enlightenment ability is not bad. You're one who knows how to use your brain. You can continue watching."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He continued to transform, more thoroughly demonstrating the principles of the Five Elements to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The white light of the metal element transformed into a pill, full and firm, indestructible as a diamond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo's heart was moved: "So the nature of metal is not only killing, but also killing oneself, eliminating one's impurities and foreign matters one by one, constantly refining to oneness. Therefore, the nature of metal is killing, but also stopping, it is gathering."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The green light of the wood element evolved from a grass sprout into a big tree, and the big tree instantly shed leaves, withered, and decayed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo comprehended the true meaning: "So the nature of wood is life on the surface, but death inside. It is precisely because of death that life exists. With life, there is death. The cycle of life and death is like the sprouting and decay of wood, this is birth and destruction, reincarnation and impermanence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The black river flowed quietly, the flora along its banks flourished, countless beasts came to drink, and people along the way dwelled and multiplied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo understood: "The nature of water is inclusiveness, it is compassion for all beings, it is non-action and non-contention, yet it is omnipresent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">This time, the red firelight burned into human form, the light of wisdom forming concentric circles one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo knew: "The nature of fire is not only fierce destruction, but also burning one's own heart, burning away the troubles and desires in the heart, illuminating the path of wisdom, guiding oneself and others. So the nature of fire is awakening, enlightenment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The yellow earth chunks cracked into countless pebbles, the pebbles rolled down from the mountain, merging one by one into the ground, being trampled, worn away, but eventually still part of the earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo felt: "The nature of earth is not only bearing, but also the final destination. No matter how high the stones fly, they will eventually fall to the ground. Profound virtue bears all things, bearing all things deepens virtue. Being originally part of the foundation, everything naturally returns to the foundation. The so-called bearing is also burying!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">At this point, Ning Zhuo deeply reached the inner foundation of the Five Elements, grasping the essential principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His Five Elements realm was elevated to the level of grandmaster!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">From now on, following these inner foundations and essential principles, he could create spells and techniques corresponding to each element.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo's head was empty, his stomach growling, his physical and mental energy completely drained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He had no strength left!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Five Elements Lord was surprised, clicking his tongue: "Strange, how close is this Spirit Concealing Willow to you? Did you plant and nurture it from small to large yourself?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"It still wants to sacrifice itself for you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Kid, it seems your destiny doesn't end here. Continue watching, haha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Lord laughed loudly and continued his demonstrations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">But this time, he no longer demonstrated each element separately, but merged and combined metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo's pupils were already dilated, his face blank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Various principles were unreasonably poured into the depths of his heart, like a flood cascading.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water, water generates wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Five Elements are mutually generative. All things in the universe can support and promote each other, life, the universe, and fate are continuously connected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Therefore, the Five Elements are endless!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Five Elements are mutually restrictive. Among all things in the universe, if any aspect expands excessively, it will be restrained and regulated by the power of another aspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Therefore, the Five Elements are stable and balanced!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Five Elements are classified separately, yet the Five Elements are also a whole. The myriad things are complex and vast, yet all things are a whole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo felt his whole body burning hot, as if on fire, his head about to explode, unable to think!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Five Elements Lord also showed surprise and delight: "Kid, so you have dual talents. Besides early wisdom, you also have another..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"So that's it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He seemed to have discerned Ning Zhuo's talent, his expression becoming somewhat strange: "Heaven gave you this talent, does it want you to walk an unorthodox path?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Interesting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Five Elements Lord's expression became complex. He looked up at the sky, sneering: "Well done, Heaven and Earth! Still resenting me for privately controlling the Five Elements? Even when I want to find a successor, I can't."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Having the talent, able to catch my eye, yet I can't be his master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Fine, fine, fine. Inheritance comes first, it doesn't matter if I can't be the master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Saying this, the Five Elements Lord's eyes flashed with divine light, staring intently at Ning Zhuo, saying sternly: "Kid, remember, I am not your master! I was just demonstrating the principles of the Five Elements, not guiding you. You accidentally stole this knowledge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo was already mentally exhausted, his spirit depleted, completely unable to hear clearly what the Five Elements Lord was saying, but his left arm began to burn hot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Five Elements Lord's face showed solemnity: "Next is the profound principle of my created 'Five Organs Temple Divine Art'."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Heaven has Five Elements, so does man!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Metal, wood, water, fire, earth; liver, lung, kidney, heart, spleen; anger, sorrow, fear, joy, worry!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The Five Elements rotate, the Five Organs flourish and decline, thus can regulate nature, all things transform and use, the Five Elements enter the body..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">When the Five Elements Lord created this divine technique, he directly advanced to become an unsurpassed grandmaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Unprecedented in the past, with successors in the future. Even if he were still alive today, he couldn't be called "unsurpassed", but he had reached an extremely profound and subtle level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo listened and felt as if his soul was about to leave his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Each sentence, each word of the Five Elements Lord turned into the primal sound of heaven and earth. This sound was both big and small, extremely contradictory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">What Ning Zhuo could understand was vast and boundless, what he couldn't understand became so faint it was nearly inaudible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He was like a lone boat, tossing and turning in a stormy tsunami, dizzy and disoriented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Spirit Concealing Willow finally couldn't hold on, not a leaf left on the tree, as if not yet a dried corpse, dim and lifeless, with barely any vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo relied entirely on his mysterious talent and the Spirit Concealing Willow's boost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">After a great force, he suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, the lone boat in the tsunami finally fell apart, directly smashed and sunk by the huge waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Some time passed, and Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">His head was splitting with pain, his vision a blur of white, unclear, only able to see vague human shapes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Although the face was unclear, Ning Zhuo recognized Sun Lingtong at a glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He was too familiar with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Sun Lingtong had been guarding by the bedside, seeing Ning Zhuo open his eyes, she clapped her hands joyfully: "Great, Little Zhuo, you're finally awake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"I went to check on you after you entered the spirit plant cabin and took too long, unexpectedly finding you collapsed unconscious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"I used the medical cabin of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to stabilize your life force. You've been in a coma for three days and three nights."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"What on earth happened to you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly: "The opportunity was too great, I couldn't digest it all, almost died from overeating."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo, in a weak voice, explained the details to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong scratched her head: "The Five Elements Lord took a liking to you? Wanted to make you his successor across generations! No wonder the Spirit Concealing Willow looks like it's dying."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"What? Boss, what did you say happened to the Spirit Concealing Willow?" Ning Zhuo jolted, wanting to sit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">But Sun Lingtong was quick, directly pressing him down with one hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Lie down properly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Your condition is still not good, you need to rest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"This is bad news, don't get too excited... The Spirit Concealing Willow is dying."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo struggled, very anxious: "Boss, the Spirit Concealing Willow is an important inheritance treasure, we can't let anything happen to it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Quick, help me go see it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sun Lingtong couldn't stop Ning Zhuo, so she had to help him up and walk to the spirit plant cabin again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo circulated his energy, digesting the medicine's power, his vision becoming a bit clearer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"This is bad!" Seeing the Spirit Concealing Willow, his heart instantly sank to the bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
