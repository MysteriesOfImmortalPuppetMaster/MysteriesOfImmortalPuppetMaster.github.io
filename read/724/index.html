<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo acted immediately, unleashing a barrage of Soul Arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Lady Spiderweb, already subdued, remained motionless, forced to endure the onslaught of spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">After the round of Soul Arts concluded, Ning Zhuo fell silent once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Lady Spiderweb, however, revealed a hint of excitement and certainty, her gaze fixed on Ning Zhuo. "Young Master, is that all you've got? I saw you fail to cast several Soul Arts just now. Are you alright? Did you get hurt?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Her feigned concern masked mockery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly, unfazed by her taunts. His tone remained calm. "Your Soul is protected by three layers of defense. The first is Spiderweb Soul Entanglement, the second is the Stellar Path spell that redirects attacks and shields vital points, and the final layer is a magic treasure screen that channels the Demoness's power. Am I correct?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Lady Spiderweb's expression remained composed, but her heart churned like a stone had been dropped into a still lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo had hit the mark perfectly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Spiderweb Soul Entanglement was a defensive technique she had developed herself, combining her innate spider silk with other materials to create a barrier that could endure for extended periods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Stellar Path spell, known as the Palace Shifting and Star Swapping Technique, was a gift bestowed upon Lady Spiderweb after she willingly offered herself to a Demonic Path powerhouse residing in a celestial palace. Her devoted service earned her this protective technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Her final magic treasure was the Hundred Beauties Brocade Screen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Lady Spiderweb had once engaged in deep collaboration with a Master Refiner, trading her beauty for the Master Refiner's expertise. Using her own spider silk as the primary material, they forged this Demonic Path screen, her ultimate defensive trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Though Lady Spiderweb had been enslaved, her magic treasures remained untouched - a gesture of sincerity from Che Zhuzi toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">When Lady Spiderweb approached Ning Zhuo, he merely confiscated her storage equipment, along with her visible magic treasures and artifacts. After a cursory inspection revealed nothing extraordinary, he stored them in the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon's cargo hold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It was during this probing that Ning Zhuo triggered the Hundred Beauties Brocade Screen, which Lady Spiderweb had concealed within her Upper Dantian in her divine sea, thus uncovering its existence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Lady Spiderweb never imagined Ning Zhuo could so effortlessly expose all her hidden cards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">For a moment, she could only force herself to remain calm. "Don't panic, don't panic! He's still just bluffing. Even if he knows, what can he do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"The divine sea is vast. How could he possibly find the tiny Hundred Beauties Brocade Screen hidden in my Upper Dantian?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"This magic treasure is my strongest trump card!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In the next moment, Ning Zhuo commanded, "Lady Spiderweb, I order you to hand over the magic treasure screen hidden in your divine sea and offer it to me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Lady Spiderweb immediately complied, "Yes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Slave Contract bound her body and soul, leaving her no choice but to obey. However, when she tried to control the Hundred Beauties Brocade Screen with her divine sense, she was met with resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This magic treasure, imbued with the great power of the Charming Maiden Heavenly Demon, could be considered a sentient artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Of course, this was fundamentally different from a truly living artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sensing its own danger, the Hundred Beauties Brocade Screen directly rejected Lady Spiderweb's command, remaining hidden within her Upper Dantian, showing no intention of risking exposure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Normally, Lady Spiderweb would have been furious at such disobedience. But now, trapped in her predicament, she secretly rejoiced at this turn of events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Smiling at Ning Zhuo, she spread her hands. "Young Master, you see? It's not my fault. I'm obeying you, but my magic treasure refuses to listen. What can I do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo thought to himself, "This situation is indeed quite troublesome."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The problem wasn't that he lacked methods to deal with Lady Spiderweb, but rather that these methods were newly acquired and entirely untested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">After a moment's contemplation, Ning Zhuo retrieved a pine tree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This was Spirit Wood, at the Foundation Establishment level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He had previously planned to cultivate Literary Pines and Martial Pines within the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon Cabin, ensuring his Pine Wave Qi Nurturing Art would always have a practical application.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This Literary Pine was one of the treasures Old Chef had procured during his recent expedition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Before Lady Spiderweb's eyes, Ning Zhuo severed many branches from the pine tree. Then, channeling his Five Elements Qi, he conjured Five Elements Fire to forge the branches into a series of bells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He shook the bells gently, their silent vibrations resonating with Literary Pine's Tree Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Immediately, a flood of sensations surged through Ning Zhuo's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Thirst.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Literary Pine's slender roots pierced through the granite, desperately seeking underground water veins. Its "toes" burrowed through fissures in the rock layers, finally discovering a mineral vein. The roots greedily absorbed iron-rich groundwater, its taste akin to bloody brine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In the depths of winter, successive blizzards had blanketed the pine branches with thick layers of snow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The tree's crown was bent under the weight, as if one could hear the slender branches groaning under the strain. Suddenly, an old branch snapped with a crack, sending the snow cascading down and instantly relieving the pine tree of its burden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Numb!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Lightning struck Literary Pine, and the world dissolved into a blinding white. The tree's crown was charred by the thunderous strike, and the lightning penetrated deep into the trunk, searing its mark into the growth rings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Nine Nether Bone-Seeking Bell was designed to sense its target's emotions, both present and buried deep within their memories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Originally a support-type Magic Artifact, it could awaken the target's most unforgettable feelings during battle, disrupting their rational thought, causing them to drown in old emotions, and exposing fatal vulnerabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Each wooden bell could only be shaken for a dozen breaths before rapidly disintegrating into splinters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo used all the bells, then closed his eyes for several dozen breaths before slowly opening them again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He glanced at Lady Spiderweb, whose expression had visibly darkened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly, first healing Literary Pine with a few quick spells before returning it to the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon's storage cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Lady Spiderweb, what do you think of my Nine Nether Bone-Seeking Bell technique?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Lady Spiderweb gritted her teeth, fully aware of the implications. This method essentially involved using local materials to forge a bell capable of communicating with the depths of one's heart, awakening the deepest emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">To use it on her, all he needed to do was extract her bones, refine them into a bell, and its power would undoubtedly surpass that of the wooden bells by several orders of magnitude!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">After all, the technique was called the Nine Nether Bone-Seeking Bell, not the Nine Nether Wood-Seeking Bell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Moreover, because the bell connected directly to the heart, none of Lady Spiderweb's threefold defenses could fully shield her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Seeing the subtle shift in Lady Spiderweb's expression, Ning Zhuo knew she was growing anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He smiled faintly and summoned a Spirit Sparrow with Foundation Establishment cultivation, another creature procured by Old Chef.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Switching to a different spell, Ning Zhuo aimed it at the Spirit Sparrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Soul Art - Soul Cicada Molt!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The spell consumed spiritual energy, targeting the sparrow's soul. The outer layer of its soul rapidly transformed, forming a cicada-like shell of armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Spirit Sparrow fluttered wildly in Ning Zhuo's palm, clearly uncomfortable. With a sudden tear, he ripped off the outer layer of the sparrow's soul, the cicada-like molt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Spirit Sparrow let out a piercing screech, conveying its agonizing pain. Lady Spiderweb's brow twitched violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo picked up the sparrow's soul molt and held it in his hand, actively absorbing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The molt dissolved rapidly, like ice melting into water, vanishing into nothingness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Yet Ning Zhuo received vivid fragments of memories:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Clinging to a damp, sticky eggshell, the bone-chilling cold pierced through. It pecked frantically, a blinding ray of sunlight piercing through the crack, piercing its dark world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Unable to open its eyes, the gnawing hunger drove it to open its beak and chirp wildly. Then, a warm, fleshy lump was shoved into its mouth, carrying the earthy stench of worms and the sour rancidity of its mother's crop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">During its first flight attempt, it crashed into a mountain rock, its tender feathers snapping and blood gushing forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Hidden among the branches, a wildcat suddenly pounced. In a life-or-death moment, it exploded into flight, its terrified droppings landing squarely on the cat's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The Soul Cicada Molt spell was actually a technique for cultivators to temper their minds. It could recreate all the hardships and pain they had endured throughout their lives, allowing them to reflect on their experiences and learn from their mistakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After successfully testing the spell, Ning Zhuo smiled again at Lady Spiderweb and asked, "What do you think of this spell?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Forcing herself to smile, Lady Spiderweb stubbornly maintained her composure. "Young Master, you should know I'm neither a spirit plant nor a spirit sparrow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Demon Cultivator had completely lost her earlier arrogance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">She understood that the Soul Cicada Molt, like the Nine Nether Bone-Seeking Bell, could bypass her defenses and steal her layered techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo cast a healing spell on the spirit sparrow, then stored it away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He turned to Lady Spiderweb and sighed. "Demonic Cultivators are incorrigibly stubborn. Very well, I'll have to teach you a proper lesson myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Come!" Lady Spiderweb forced herself to remain calm, straightening her posture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo's expression turned serious as he slowly began to cast a third, distinct Soul Art before her eyes - the Three Souls Spinning Wheel Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Lady Spiderweb's body convulsed violently, as if struck by lightning, then tensed like a drawn bowstring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Fetal Light Soul, Refreshing Soul, and Hidden Essence Soul trembled simultaneously before being forcibly extracted by a strange power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The intense pain caused Lady Spiderweb's pupils to constrict sharply, her face paling as she gasped, a pained moan escaping her lips: "Ah..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The Fetal Light Soul was the first to detach from her body, transforming before her eyes into shimmering white silk brocade. A frosty mist emanated from the fabric.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Next, the Refreshing Soul was twisted into crimson threads, vivid as rouge, and woven into the white silk. The icy mist visibly diminished with each passing moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Finally, as the mist vanished completely, the Hidden Essence Soul materialized as a veil of purple miasma, spreading across the red and white brocade until the poisonous haze was fully absorbed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In the end, a Soul Cloth woven from crimson, white, and violet threads gradually took shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The excruciating pain persisted relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo's fingers danced across the air, manipulating the threads with practiced precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Lady Spiderweb, convulsing in agony from the Soul art, could no longer stand. She collapsed to the ground, her fingernails digging into the earth, leaving pale scratches in their wake. Sweat soaked her hair, clinging to her skin as she teetered on the brink of collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Her eyes rolled back, and she nearly fainted on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo ceased his incantation, glanced at the three-colored Soul Cloth floating in mid-air, then turned his calm gaze to Lady Spiderweb. "Demonic Cultivator, have you learned your lesson? Or do you still wish to resist?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Lady Spiderweb's chest heaved violently as she gasped for breath. Weakly, she spat at Ning Zhuo, "I... I'm practically dead already. Just finish me off!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The excruciating pain had ignited her ferocity and rage. In that moment, she wished nothing more than to take Ning Zhuo down with her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo sighed. "Since you persist in your stubborn resistance, you leave me no choice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He pointed a finger at the three-colored Soul Cloth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">In the next instant, the Soul Cloth burst into flames without a spark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Soul-Crossing Burning Boat Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The Soul Cloth burned fiercely, transforming into a small boat amidst the flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo's soul detached from his body with a small leap, he boarded the vessel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Streams of memories surged into his soul like a raging river, as if he were experiencing them firsthand!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In a mountain valley, the yet-to-transform Lady Spiderweb was being hunted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">A white-robed youth laughed heartily. "Stop running! If you keep fleeing, I'll kill you. Just be a good little Demon Pet for me - what's so bad about that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">During their adventure, Lady Spiderweb accidentally consumed a Heavenly Treasure and successfully transformed into human form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The white-robed youth stared dumbfounded at the naked Lady Spiderweb, his face flushing crimson. "Lady Spiderweb, you're even more beautiful than I imagined!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The middle-aged cultivator's face still bore traces of the spirited youth he once was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Mortally wounded and on the verge of death, he voluntarily severed the Slave Contract with Lady Spiderweb. "My Lady, I'm done for. Before I go, I have a question. I forcibly took you. Do you resent me for it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Lady Spiderweb shook her head, tears streaming down her face. She pressed her hands against the cultivator's wound, but the blood continued to flow unchecked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The cultivator smiled faintly, gazing at Lady Spiderweb with tenderness. "We're trapped by the enemy, our supplies exhausted. If you eat me, you'll gain strength and might escape..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The cultivator's breath faded completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Lady Spiderweb wept bitterly. "Young Master! Have you forgotten? I promised you I would never eat humans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The enemy broke through the barrier, finding Lady Spiderweb sitting motionless on the ground, her face ashen. The middle-aged man had been reduced to ashes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The enemy initially flew into a rage, but when they saw Lady Spiderweb's beauty, their lips curled into a smirk. They lifted her chin. "Well, well, quite the looker."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Lady Spiderweb endured humiliation and willingly sacrificed herself, acting as an internal agent. On the bed, she pierced her powerful enemy's heart with spider silk, successfully avenging herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The female Demonic Cultivator who had manipulated her suddenly felt a pang of compassion and rescued Lady Spiderweb.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Lady Spiderweb was brought to the Enchantress Demonic Sect, where she devoted herself to cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Strands of spider silk pierced enemies, while seductive techniques tempted all living beings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Why aren't you eating?" the Tiger Demon accompanying her asked, surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Lady Spiderweb's face remained cold. "I don't eat people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">An elder of the Demonic Sect, witnessing this, thought, "This Spider Demon is quite intriguing." He secretly offered guidance, teaching her formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">As the Soul Cloth burned to ashes, Ning Zhuo's soul returned to his body. He fell silent, his gaze toward Lady Spiderweb now complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">From the memories he had gleaned, Lady Spiderweb was merely a pawn of fate, repeatedly tossed about by misfortune. She was more a victim than a perpetrator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Refusing to devour humans was her principle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Often, she had been forced into desperate situations, with no other way out. Many of her infamous deeds were the result of false accusations, bounties, and the echo chamber of public opinion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"For survival, for vengeance, her fierce counterattacks were understandable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"She had been captured and enslaved by powerful figures far too many times. Most of her evil acts were committed under orders."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo had failed to uncover any information about Ban Ji, but he had learned about Lady Spiderweb's past, unexpectedly discovering that this demonic woman was not as deeply mired in sin as he had imagined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Lady Spiderweb's pupils constricted, her face paling as she stared at Ning Zhuo in terror. "The... the Soul-Crossing Burning Boat Technique?" she gasped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "You have some knowledge, it seems."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Lady Spiderweb was utterly terrified. She knew that if this technique were used against her, her soul would be reduced to fuel, burned away completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"No... don't..." she pleaded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Her previous hatred and rage had been replaced by a desperate will to survive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Young Master, Young Master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"I was wrong! Spare my life! Spare my life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"I'll be your slave, your dog! Spare me, and I'll serve you faithfully! I'll do anything you ask, anything at all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
