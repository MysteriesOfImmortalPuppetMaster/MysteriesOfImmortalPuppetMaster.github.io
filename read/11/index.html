<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Faced with Ning Zhanji's sudden test, the others looked at each other in bewilderment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo guessed: “These spirit plants are still young and not very valuable, so it can’t be that we’re picking them to sell. Instead, we’re cleaning them up to keep this passage clear; if we leave the spirit plants to grow here, spirit beasts and monster beasts will come over as well. In order to use this passage for a long period of time, our clan has to make sure that that doesn’t happen.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Not bad.” Ning Zhanji nodded. “It seems you’ve learned well in the academy. As a reward, you can pick one of these spirit plants. As for which one you pick, that will depend on your eyesight.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo didn’t hesitate. He reached out and grabbed the fire crystal grass, then expressed his gratitude: “Thank you, Sir Ning Zhanji! I’ve done some research into the herbal medicine market. Among these spirit plants, the fire crystal grass is the most expensive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhanji nodded, then shook his head: “You picked the one with the highest market price, and that isn’t a bad thing. But if it were me, I would have chosen the vigor ginseng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“The cultivation technique of our Ning Clan is ice-aligned, making spirit plants like the fire crystal grass unsuitable for us. However, vigor ginseng can be used to nourish our bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“You are still young, so don’t blindly chase after money. You should know that investing in yourself is the true path to success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Once you reach the Foundation Establishment stage, your whole life will be completely different.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo had an expression of enlightenment as he listened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhanji took the opportunity to continue teaching: “An outstanding cultivator is one who dares to fight. It’s important that you judge risk and reward clearly; if you join the war hall and are assigned to this place, you’ll be able to harvest several spirit plants every day under the protection of the temporary encampment. This is a rare opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Oftentimes, rejecting risks means rejecting opportunities.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo seemed thoughtful. His expression was obvious to Ning Zhanji, who chuckled internally: “In the end, he’s still a youngster…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Sir, I want to join!” Ning Yong shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhanji laughed: “Newbie, see if you can pass the special training first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Soon, the team of Ning Clan cultivators entered an underground hall. This was obviously a frontline encampment that the clan had established.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">There were two cultivators of the Ning Clan stationed in the hall, who quickly greeted the arriving team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhanji ordered the team to take a rest. Standing in the center of the underground hall, he operated his magical power and formed hand seals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Complex formation patterns immediately appeared on the cavern ceiling. At the center of the formation patterns, a formation disk the size of a millstone slowly descended until it landed in front of Ning Zhanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Placing his hands on the formation disk, Ning Zhanji sent out his divine sense and quickly retrieved the recorded information. In just a few breaths of time, he knew everything that had happened in this frontline encampment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">After doing all this, he took out some spirit stones and replaced all the dimmed, used-up spirit stones inside the formation disk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Then, after a short rest, the team of Ning Clan cultivators resumed their journey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Along the way, they passed three encampments in total. They rested in some, and directly walked through others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">As they walked deeper and deeper into the volcano, the threat level also gradually increased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">They found more and more traces of monster beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">There were fire velvet rats the size of a person’s foot, red lava demons whose rocky heads floated in the air, and even Flame-Treading Lizards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Stop!” Ning Zhanji, who had been leading at the front, suddenly raised his hand and stopped in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The rest of the cultivators quickly stopped, going from motion to stillness in an instant and displaying perfect discipline and obedience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhanji lowered his head and carefully examined a small groove in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He stretched out his finger and gently stroked the inside of the small groove. The surface was smooth and emitted a slight luster, like glass.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“It’s a fire snake, probably more than a hundred years old. In other words, a monster beast at the Foundation Establishment stage.” After explaining, Ning Zhanji ordered the entire team to be on high alert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Yong was excited: “We’re finally going to see one! With Sir Ning Zhanji here, what’s there to fear from a mere monster beast?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Chen analyzed: “Not counting us newcomers, there are six Foundation Establishment cultivators here, and the others are all in the upper levels of Qi Refining. A mere Foundation Establishment monster beast is nothing to worry about.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">However, Ning Zhuo secretly grew wary. He knew that the physical bodies of monster beasts usually far surpassed those of human cultivators. Moreover, this was the Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern; if the battle was drawn out, then it could attract a horde of other monster beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The team of Ning Clan cultivators continued moving forward. However, their speed had slowed significantly, and the mood had also changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Soon, they came across the fire snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The fire snake’s body was slender, and it glowed with dazzling flames. In fact, it almost seemed like a blazing flame in and of itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Actually, fire snakes were existences similar to flame spirits, lacking the physical body of conventional monster beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The fire snake was fast and fierce. As it slithered over the rocks, it left a snaking groove in its wake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">When Ning Zhanji had found the groove previously, his judgment had been based on the width of the groove and the remnant heat on its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Now that they met the true owner, the group found that Ning Zhanji’s judgment had been correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This was indeed a Foundation Establishment stage monster beast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Ning Clan cultivators prepared to attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">First, a cultivator threw out a formation disk, giving rise to a formation that concealed everyone’s aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Next, many cultivators launched spells, causing numerous water arrows to shoot at the fire snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The fire snake was immediately struck by a wave of sneak attacks. It was only after the flames on its body were mostly extinguished that it managed to react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The fire snake charged at the Ning Clan cultivators with fierce momentum. In response, two burly men covered in spell power rushed out from the team, wrestling the fire snake and holding it down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The rest of the cultivators continued casting spells. Some reinforced the burly cultivators, while others unleashed offensive spells to kill the fire snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Two fists cannot defeat four hands; in the face of overwhelming numbers, and bombarded by countless water- and ice-type spells, the fire snake’s body quickly shrank to one-third of its previous size.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Realizing that it was outmatched, the fire snake tried to escape. But Ning Zhanji jumped over like lightning and intercepted it. He clapped his hands together and sent out two palms made of frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The palms spiraled through the air, exuding waves of biting cold that caused the fire snake’s movements to slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Two booms echoed out at almost the same time as the frost palms directly brought an end to the fire snake’s life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">A perfect kill!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Yong’s eyes lit up, and he became more and more excited: “As expected of Sir Ning Zhanji!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">His voice was full of yearning and admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly. His expression was similar to Ning Yong, but internally, he was wondering: “This volcano has strong fire-element spirit energy, making frost spells rather unwieldy. Why is everyone using them?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">After a few more battles against monster beasts, Ning Zhuo gradually understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">As it turned out, Ning Zhanji was doing this to train his troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">When they encountered weaker monster beasts, they used spells and trained their cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">When strong monster beasts appeared, they used various magic artifacts, and Ning Zhanji attacked at the vanguard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">In order to avoid trouble, the team focused on ending their battles as fast as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“There’s a Molten Flame Demonic Ape up ahead!” Suddenly, the cultivator in charge of scouting shouted a warning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The whole team immediately halted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">An adult Molten Flame Demonic Ape was very difficult to take down. A single demonic ape could be as strong as ten Foundation Establishment cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">And a demonic ape this far in was unlikely to be a juvenile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Even Ning Zhanji furrowed his brows at this news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Wait a second, there’s something wrong with the demonic ape.” The lookout closed his eyes tightly, and the headband on his head emitted a faint light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“It… it’s dead?!” The lookout exclaimed in disbelief as he opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
