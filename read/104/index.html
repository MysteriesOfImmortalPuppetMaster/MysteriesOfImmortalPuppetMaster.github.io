<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 104: Renewing My Buddha</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">At the 'Spirit Growth' stage, Yuan Dasheng needs to increase his spirituality until it reaches ten full levels. Ten levels signify a qualitative change! Once achieved, spirituality will be self-restoring, continuously regenerating. Otherwise, spirituality will deplete as it is used, which is a significant disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This is Yuan Dasheng's current situation. Originally possessing eight levels of spirituality, it has dropped to seven-point-nine and cannot self-recover. Unless one day, it reaches ten full levels and undergoes a qualitative change, it won't be able to restore itself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">After reading the jade slip, Ning Zhuo's first thought was, "Choosing Yuan Dasheng's corpse was indeed the correct decision."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"According to the information from the Lava Immortal Palace, selecting any corpse would only yield a mechanism of the Spirit Charm level. This is merely the first stage of the Dead Spirit period." "But by using Yuan Dasheng's corpse, I obtained the Golden Blood Battle Ape, which spans seven stages, reaching the Spirit Growth stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Previously, Ning Zhuo knew that the Golden Blood Battle Ape's quality was exceptional. Now, after reading "Theory on Spirituality," he fully understands the extent of its superiority!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"So, how can I increase its spirituality?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The "Theory on Spirituality" tome did not contain this information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Perhaps it does, but itâ€™s not available to me. As an outsider, gaining access to this tome is thanks to the alliance of the three families." Although "Theory on Spirituality" did not detail the method, it recorded relevant history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In the cultivation world, there once was a notorious demonic sect, infamous and dominating, known as the Spirit Burial Sect. This sect practiced a technique called the Three Lives Spirit Sacrifice Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The term 'three lives' does not refer to three lives but is derived from the idea of 'Three giving birth to all things.' It means sacrificing all things to gain spirituality. The Spirit Burial Sect used this technique to slaughter countless beings, obtaining vast amounts of spirituality to mass-produce spiritual treasures and expand their influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Seeing the threat posed by the Spirit Burial Sect, righteous sects, evil sects, and even other demonic factions united against it, ultimately eradicating this immense threat to the cultivation world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"The Three Lives Spirit Sacrifice Method..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo recalled that among the rewards after passing the three trials of the Buddha gate was a technique named "Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"This might be the secret technique to increase spirituality," Ning Zhuo thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">His guess wasn't baseless. He had evidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Previously, when he was exploring the first trial of the Buddha gate, he received related information upon selecting a corpse from the coffin. The message stated, "Choose one, send it to the furnace for fire burial, and obtain a Spirit Charm mechanism."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Fire Burial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The clues of obtaining a spirit-charmed mechanism through fire burial directly relate to the "Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Next time I venture into the Lava Immortal Palace, I'll choose this reward," Ning Zhuo thought, feeling a strong intuition that this was the right choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">However, entering the Lava Immortal Palace is not easy. Things are different now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo is currently under the protection of four Ning family cultivators, and these aren't the same four individuals all the time. They rotate shifts periodically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">If Ning Zhuo's spirit enters the palace, the chances of being discovered would greatly increase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He also worried about what to do if he encountered the three geniuses from the allied families or Meng Chong in the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He couldn't ascertain Meng Chong's situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The three geniuses had protective talismans from the Ning family. To enter the palace, they could simply remove these talismans. This was entirely unpredictable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"There are two ways."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"One, I stay outside the palace and remotely control Yuan Dasheng, letting it delve deeper into the palace. Since it's my creation, it counts as part of me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Two, I join forces with Zheng Jian and others to explore the palace together. This depends on Zhou Zeshan's cultivation progress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Previously, at the Tziyou Garden, Ning Zhuo and the others had agreed to explore the palace together once Zhou Zeshan reached the peak of the third layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and decided the second method was better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Upon leaving the Zhou family's treasure hall, he inquired with a nearby cultivator, "Do you know how far along Zhou Zeshan is in his cultivation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Currently, he's in the late stage of the third layer," the Zhou family cultivator replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo frowned slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Zhou family cultivator, eager to defend his family's reputation, quickly added, "Ning Zhuo, you must understand that our Zhou Zeshan possesses a top-tier talent called 'Water Accumulation into Abyss.' As the saying goes, 'Accumulate soil into a mountain, wind and rain arise; accumulate water into an abyss, dragons are born.' This talent requires constant accumulation of water energy, eventually forming an abyssal force and displaying immense power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Therefore, in the early stages, Zhou Zeshan's mana accumulates slowly, needing more resources, time, and patience than others. But with loss comes gain! Zhou Zeshan will surely experience a significant leap in cultivation in the later stages!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, "So, how much longer do you estimate?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The Zhou family cultivator smiled wryly, "Ning Zhuo, please don't put me on the spot. Why not ask Zhou Zeshan directly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo went to find Zhou Zeshan and asked him personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Given Ning Zhuo's current status, reputation, and relationship with the three geniuses, he easily obtained a direct answer from Zhou Zeshan himself: "At most, I need seven more days."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"This timeframe is acceptable," Ning Zhuo thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">If he forcibly relied solely on the Golden Blood Battle Ape, without participating himself, Yuan Dasheng would be severely damaged even if it managed to clear the challenges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">At present, Ning Zhuo's research on Yuan Dasheng's mechanical body is not thorough enough, and repairing Yuan Dasheng in the Lava Immortal Palace is also very difficult. Ning Zhuo's biggest concern is that using the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng at such high intensity will cause its spiritual energy to decline again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Moreover, the decline is entirely predictable and will certainly be much more severe than when Yuan Dasheng fought Meng Chong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">However, upon returning home and resuming his daily cultivation, Ning Zhuo made a startling discovery. He found that the the Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his spiritual sea had been activated again. Although it was only once, the timing coincided with his decision, made after deliberation at the Zhou family, to wait for Zhou Zeshan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"A low fate energy can cause confusion and clouded judgment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"But the Buddha Heart Demon Seal can suppress fate energy, making me clear-minded like a Buddha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo, reflecting on this, immediately realized that his decision to wait had been influenced by fate energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"In that case, doesn't it mean that the first option is the correct one?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo pondered deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"According to 'Fate Energy Theory, Volume One,' Meng Chong and I are in a fierce struggle, and until one of us achieves a decisive victory, our fate energies will continue to clash. So, my fate energy is not as strong as that of the three-family alliance, which led to a moment of confusion?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo realized in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Yes, I am currently racing against time! Why should I waste seven days waiting for Zhou Zeshan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Immediately, Ning Zhuo decidedâ€”to use the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng to break through the challenges!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He hid in the cultivation chamber within his bedroom and activated the Floating Cloud Handkerchief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">First, he took out the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The transmission circle activated silently, successfully transporting Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Then, Ning Zhuo activated the "Trial Disciple" seal, sending his soul into the palace along with the Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Only by doing this did it count as a new attempt at breaking through the challenges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">As before, he appeared in Room One.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo did not even touch the first door; he immediately withdrew his soul and returned to his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Golden Blood Battle Ape: Dasheng took his place, touched the first door, claimed the reward, and pushed the door open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The next moment, Yuan Dasheng encountered Zhou Zhu, Zhou Zeshan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
