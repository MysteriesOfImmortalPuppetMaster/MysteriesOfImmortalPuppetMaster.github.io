<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Late at night.<br/>
<br/>
In the deep night sky, the distant mountain ranges were indistinct and hazy.<br/>
<br/>
A cold night wind swept through the entire Red Flower Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
Not far away, Green Forest Immortal City remained brightly lit even at night. The warm orange glow, along with the faint laughter and music drifting in the wind, only made the military camp’s solitude and desolation more apparent.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was patrolling at night and, upon entering the area where the wounded were gathered, her face showed anger.<br/>
<br/>
The wounded were all gathered together.<br/>
<br/>
Her divine sense detected many wounded soldiers lying on the ground at night, shivering in the cold. Some curled up into a ball, others groaned in their sleep.<br/>
<br/>
“What’s going on? Why not activate the formation so the tents can be a bit warmer?!” Mulan glared around, using divine sense to reprimand her subordinates.<br/>
<br/>
They quickly reported: “General, our army’s spirit stones are running short. We must cut back wherever we can.”<br/>
<br/>
She promptly recalled that during the day, she had been troubled over the depleted military funds while handling military affairs.<br/>
<br/>
“I once reported this to you; this was your order,” the subordinate reminded her.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan’s expression froze.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, the subordinate had reported it to her. At the time, she thought, “We must not shortchange the pensions for our fallen soldiers. We must save wherever we can!”<br/>
<br/>
Ensuring warmth inside the tents was, in Mulan’s view, indeed something that could be reduced.<br/>
<br/>
Military funds were so tight that even spending a few hundred spirit stones for one night was something Mulan had to pinch pennies over.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
For her to now give the order to fill in spirit stones and raise the temperature… she couldn’t bring herself to do it.<br/>
<br/>
The military funds were simply too tight!<br/>
<br/>
In silence, Mulan lifted the tent’s curtain and entered inside.<br/>
<br/>
A pungent odor hit her face.<br/>
<br/>
The smell of blood, poison, and cold sickness...<br/>
<br/>
Most of the wounded lay on the ground, sleeping heavily on makeshift beds.<br/>
<br/>
Only about twenty stretchers carried the gravely injured.<br/>
<br/>
A few injured soldiers, in too much pain, drifted in and out of a half-conscious state.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi was still treating the wounded.<br/>
<br/>
He half-knelt beside a stretcher, scooping medicine paste from a clay jar with his hand and applying it to the wounded soldier’s wound.<br/>
<br/>
From time to time, he used his cultivation technique to help the wounded absorb the medicine’s effect.<br/>
<br/>
The severely injured soldier on the stretcher, upon discovering Mulan’s presence, struggled to get up and salute.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Mulan, Zhang Zhongyi only glanced at her and then continued his treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan stepped forward and pressed the soldier down, her expression as hard as iron: “Lie down and accept the treatment.”<br/>
<br/>
“General!” the wounded soldier choked up.<br/>
<br/>
“When you recover, we’ll kill the enemy together,” Mulan encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, General!” The wounded soldier became so excited that his eyes rolled back, and he fainted on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan: ……<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi sighed and repeatedly waved at Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
With a heavy heart, Mulan left the tent.<br/>
<br/>
A moment later, inside the commander’s tent, Zhang Zhongyi dragged his exhausted body to report to Mulan: “The situation is terrible.”<br/>
<br/>
“We have too few physicians. Even with me working tirelessly day and night, it’s impossible to handle so many wounded.”<br/>
<br/>
“The conditions in the camp are very poor, we can’t even ensure warmth.”<br/>
<br/>
“If we have several more nights this cold, I’m afraid many gravely injured soldiers will lose their lives.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan spoke in a deep voice: “We must do everything we can to cure them.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi frowned: “Has it really come to such dire straits? How much funding do we have left?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi knew full well that Mulan was by no means stingy and would never skimp on military funds.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan forced a smile: “Uncle Zhang, though the funding is minimal, there is still some safeguard. You have worked hard for three days and nights. What are the wounded thinking and feeling?”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi said: “Most of the wounded are veteran soldiers, they bear no resentment, only deep concern over the defeat.”<br/>
<br/>
“These are truly the real backbone of the Grand Marshal’s residence.”<br/>
<br/>
“They’re all elite soldiers, good men. If they die in the camp due to insufficient treatment caused by a lack of funds, it would be too great a pity.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was moved: “Uncle Zhang, this is your treasured lifeblood artifact; how could we pawn it for money?”<br/>
<br/>
“If there is really no other way...”<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Zhang Zhongyi took out a magical treasure and handed it to Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
“Why not pawn this treasure to exchange for military funds!” Zhang Zhongyi proposed.<br/>
<br/>
“Uncle Zhang, when you joined my army, you contributed almost all your assets. If now I must have you pawn your life-bound magical treasure, how could I face my father?”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t mention this again!”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan flatly refused.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi gave a bitter laugh: “I am no longer at the Nascent Soul stage. Having fallen back to the Golden Core stage, my life-bound treasure has been affected and is now a defective item.”<br/>
<br/>
“Keeping it with me is no longer of much use.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan’s gaze was sharp: “This must not be done! If we pawn it, it will undoubtedly expose our army’s weakness. Not only would that deal a heavy blow to our morale, it would also invite swarms of enemies.”<br/>
<br/>
“At this moment, many wounded rely on the military’s strength to barely hold on. If morale plummets, our military strength will weaken, and many of the wounded would be affected—light injuries might turn severe, and severe injuries might lead to death.”<br/>
<br/>
“Uncle Zhang, although we have withdrawn from the battlefield, we are still in danger.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi was speechless for a moment, then slowly nodded, his voice hoarse: “Indeed, I did not consider this carefully.”<br/>
<br/>
The Grand Marshal’s residence of Old Marshal Mu had become a target coveted by many civil and military officials in court.<br/>
<br/>
This time, Mulan had been forced to lead troops in her father’s place because of their maneuvers.<br/>
<br/>
Once the Red Flower Battalion’s weakness was exposed, it would be like bleeding prey attracting a swarm of sharks.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi asked: “If we forcefully hold on, can we manage?”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan replied confidently: “Of course we can. Tomorrow is the day we receive provisions. With that batch of supplies, our situation will improve greatly, and we can get through this difficult period.”<br/>
<br/>
“Uncle Zhang, I have been guided carefully by my father since childhood. Rest assured, I know what I’m doing.”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi exhaled a breath of turbid air, his expression relaxing considerably: “That’s good, that’s good.”<br/>
<br/>
After he left, Mulan finally frowned. The confidence in her gaze vanished, replaced by hesitation and worry.<br/>
<br/>
As the leader of an army, she must at all times remain confident and maintain a strong image. If the commander sighs and frowns, how can one expect to maintain morale?<br/>
<br/>
Ever since the ambush ended, immense pressure had weighed on Mulan’s heart.<br/>
<br/>
She was a daughter from a family of generals and always had a clear assessment of her situation.<br/>
<br/>
By the candlelight on the desk, Mulan continued handling military affairs.<br/>
<br/>
She had to carefully account for every single expense, trying everything to cut costs from every angle.<br/>
<br/>
The gap in the accounts was so large that Mulan didn’t dare hand the ledger over to the quartermaster.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan spent half the night calculating, and looking at the ledger, she felt as if she were falling into an abyss.<br/>
<br/>
“Wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow, once we receive the provisions and a small amount of spirit stones, at least we can improve the soldiers’ meals and hold on for a while longer.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan sighed inwardly.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi had not slept for three days and nights, and neither had she. She constantly patrolled the camp, comforted the soldiers, and kept doing the accounts.<br/>
<br/>
A wave of heavy drowsiness overcame her. Exhausted, Mulan fell asleep right on the desk.<br/>
<br/>
Accounting was neither her strong suit nor something she enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
She preferred to gallop across the battlefield, shooting arrows to kill enemy leaders!<br/>
<br/>
But there was no choice. The cruel, cold reality forced her to do this.<br/>
<br/>
In a haze, she dreamed of her childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Old General Mu had returned victoriously to camp.<br/>
<br/>
“Dad!” Little Mulan had long waited at the gate. Upon seeing her father, she shouted joyfully and ran all the way, impatiently throwing herself into his arms.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, hey, slower, slower.” The old general tried to caution her but could only half-kneel down, helplessly opening his arms and doing his best to catch little Mulan gently.<br/>
<br/>
“I haven’t even taken off my armor, did it hurt you?” the old general asked with concern.<br/>
<br/>
He had just heard a thump—Mulan’s forehead knocking against his breastplate.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan lifted her head, looking up at her father with eyes full of adoration and affection: “Dad.”<br/>
<br/>
Just as she spoke, something else caught her attention: a flower.<br/>
<br/>
“Huh? What’s that?” Mulan pointed to the old general’s shoulder. “Dad, there’s a flower growing on your shoulder.”<br/>
<br/>
The old general turned to look at his left shoulder. Indeed, he saw a crimson flower bud rooted in the cracks of his pauldron, gently swaying in the breeze.<br/>
<br/>
The old general reached out, plucked it off, and handed it to Mulan: “This is a Blood Spirit Flower.”<br/>
<br/>
“This kind of flower only grows and blooms on the battlefield.”<br/>
<br/>
“The more intense the war, the more tragic the casualties, the more these Blood Spirit Flowers sprout, and the brighter their color.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was delighted: “This flower is so beautiful. I want to keep it alive.”<br/>
<br/>
She cherished any gift her father gave as if it were a treasure.<br/>
<br/>
But the old general’s face turned stern: “Nonsense!”<br/>
<br/>
“The Blood Spirit Flower is not an ordinary flower. It cannot be kept alive.”<br/>
<br/>
“It grows quickly and withers just as fast.”<br/>
<br/>
“It is nurtured by blood and lives sacrificed. It is also the origin of our Mu Family’s Red Flower Battalion’s name.”<br/>
<br/>
“You must respect it. Respect every war.”<br/>
<br/>
“Mulan, you are the only heir of the Grand Marshal’s residence. You must understand the weight of the Blood Spirit Flower!”<br/>
<br/>
“War is not a game. Each war brings casualties and sacrifices. When you become the commander of the Red Flower Battalion, remember to do your utmost to reduce our casualties and use the enemy’s blood to nourish the Blood Spirit Flower!”<br/>
<br/>
Little Mulan raised her small face, full of seriousness and solemnity. She said loudly: “Dad, I will remember!”<br/>
<br/>
…..<br/>
<br/>
“General, General, wake up quickly!” A subordinate’s urgent report awakened the slumbering Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
She looked up and saw sunlight streaming in through the lifted tent flap.<br/>
<br/>
Her subordinate’s anxious expression made a strong sense of foreboding rise in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
“What happened?” Mulan asked in a deep voice.<br/>
<br/>
The subordinate said: “We went to collect the army provisions, but the people in the Immortal City said that some procedures weren’t complete. We need to make them up before they’ll release the rations.”<br/>
<br/>
“We asked and found out it’s the Inspector General’s decision!”<br/>
<br/>
“What?!” At these words, Mulan’s vision darkened.<br/>
<br/>
The thing she feared most had still happened!<br/>
<br/>
These provisions were lifesaving to the Red Flower Battalion at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
“Zhao Yuan!” Mulan flew into a rage, immediately putting on her armor and draping her bright red cloak over her shoulders. She called for her subordinates, “Come, this general will go personally. Let’s see who dares stop me?!”</div>
