<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">But Hua Guzi couldn't continue eating like this!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo controlled the mechanical fists and feet, unleashing another powerful wave of attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Hua Guzi's spiritual seas churned wildly; it was difficult for her to maintain control over her wood elemental magic to meet his assault head-on. She drew upon all her strength to unleash a Fragrant Flower Tracing Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The mechanical fists and feet missed their target, but they quickly returned to bear down on Hua Guzi once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Hua Guzi shrieked, "Great Auntie, I know some martial arts too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">And she really did know a few moves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Pow, pow, pow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ahhhhh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The spectators watched as twenty mechanical fists surrounded a young girl, relentlessly pummeling her again and again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Fists rained down like a violent storm, causing Hua Guzi to scream continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In the end, Ning Zhuo voluntarily ceased his attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">By now, Hua Guzi's face was bruised, her entire head swelling visibly, looking quite like a pig's snout. Her eyes were swollen shut, yet she reached out with fingers purpled from blows, pointing unsteadily at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly, then used the mechanical fists to lift her out of the training grounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Immediately thereafter, the cultivators present declared that the winner of the match was Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo smiled and bowed to the audience as thanks, then walked up to Hua Guzi and cast healing magic on her before everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">After several breaths of time, Hua Guzi returned to normal, but her limbs were ice-cold; she trembled uncontrollably. Ning Zhuo produced a cup of warm autumn wine and offered it to Hua Guzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Hua Guzi's pupils contracted sharply at the scent of medicinal alcohol, realizing that this was wine brewed from Gold Core ingredients. But she forced herself to remain upright, teeth chattering. "No-no, I don't want any. I'm not going to..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He let out a cold harrumph, leaned forward, and grabbed Hua Guzi's tender cheeks with his hands, forcing her mouth open like a cherry blossom petal. Then he poured all the contents of the cup directly into Hua Guzi's mouth without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Hua Guzi's entire body jolted violently under Ning Zhuo's forceful actions, caught completely off guard. Without thinking, her throat bobbed, and she swallowed the warm autumn wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Begin cultivating," Ning Zhuo commanded coolly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Hua Guzi's body shook once more, startled by Ning Zhuo's aggressive stance. Instinctively, she rolled her throat, swallowing the wine down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Then, as if compelled by some unseen force, Hua Guzi sat down cross-legged, began cultivating, and started treating her own injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo found himself somewhat surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He hadn't planted a lifeline in Hua Guzi's mind, so he wouldn't have done such a thing in public; there was no need to risk anyone detecting it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Without this lifeline, Ning Zhuo could no longer use Heart Buddha Demon Seal to sense Hua Guzi's emotions through their bond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Who could've anticipated that Hua Guzi would obediently follow his orders and cooperate so readily?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"She refused to admit defeat until mere moments ago, yet now she can bend her will as needed," Ning Zhuo muttered to himself, somewhat bewildered. "How peculiar."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After all, he was merely sixteen years old, and though he had spent the last fourteen years observing human hearts, he had never encountered someone like Hua Guzi before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Victory!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo's victory over Hua Guzi was a resounding success. Not only did he instill fear in the cultivators on the little peak of strife, even Lai Wuying and Zheng Xingchen admitted to the strength of his martial prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In this battle, Ning Zhuo confirmed his position among wood elemental fighters and tested the efficacy of his mechanical fists in actual combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Finally, when he treated Hua Guzi without hesitation, using a medicinal wine of Gold Core caliber, he secured another wave of favorable reputation points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Even if some criticized him for putting on airs, having used resources equivalent to those of a Gold Core cultivator demonstrated that he was willing to invest heavily! It was difficult to argue with that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">In no time at all, the little peak of strife was abuzz with discussions about Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"I never imagined that Ning Zhuoâ€™s machine techniques would be more powerful than his five elemental magics."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"A true talent from the heavens!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"First impressions were rather ordinary, but he has hidden talents beneath the surface."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"If I were Ning Zhuo, I'd want to use my machine techniques straight away, crushing everyone underfoot. But instead, he hides and keeps it to himselfâ€”what a disappointment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"What do you mean 'hide and keep to oneself'? This is called humility, this is called keeping a low profile. This is what cultivator clan descendants are like. This is how they conduct themselves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">With real accomplishments laid bare for all to see, many cultivators began boasting on Ning Zhuo's behalf.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Hmph, these clan descendants clearly could have lived off their family connections, yet they still come begging for scraps alongside us rogue cultivators at Myriad Medicine Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"That's quite improper, especially when speaking of Ning Zhuo. Haven't you heard? This is merely one stop on his journey, and once the time comes, he will leave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong were both adept at spreading rumors, though Ning Zhuo excelled above all else due to his unwavering confidence. With Sun Lingtong's help, he had already begun spreading rumors ahead of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Currently, these rumors were proving beneficial to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Once everyone realized that Ning Zhuo was merely passing through and not settling down, his immortal's cave would become available again. Many of those who had harbored animosity toward him would be less inclined to dislike him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"When will he leave?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"That is unclear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"I think he actually fits right in on Little Contention."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"He's good-looking, and every time I watch him fight, it's like watching something beautiful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"He truly is gentle and elegant. After defeating Hua Guzi, he even fed her some medicinal wine brewed from Gold Core-grade ingredients. Who else has done such a thing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Thus, the crowd learned why Ning Zhuo had recovered so quickly after his battle with Han Zhou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The next day at the training grounds, Han Zhou once again retreated before the combined attacks of twenty-plus machine techniques, calling for a halt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Unlike before, Ning Zhuo did not seem as satisfied by the end of the session. He felt that this kind of training yielded far fewer spiritual insights than previous sessions, barely enough to account for thirty percent of what he'd gained earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He mulled over the matter privately: "The main reason is because my bout with Hua Guzi gave me ample opportunity to put theory into practice, allowing me to identify many shortcomings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Further sparring with Han Zhou will only result in both parties holding back; it won't stimulate me as much."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo felt increasingly certain that his little peak of strife was truly blessed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">It was because he had gained ample practical experience here, greatly filling in his own deficiencies and making great strides in many areas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"The benefits I've gleaned from Han Zhou may still exist, but they're no longer sufficient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Perhaps it's time to find another partner for these spars."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Maintain our relationship with Han Zhou, so we can acquire more bitter water to drink."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo pondered this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After the end of their training session, he and Han Zhou walked side by side out of the training grounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Han Zhou said, "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, why bother treating Hua Guzi after every battle? As far as I see it, wasting Gold Core level medicinal wine is rather unjustified."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Han Zhou seemed somewhat resentful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This resentment stemmed from when Ning Zhuo had sought him out, asking him to infuse the mechanical strikes with bitter cold energy. At the time, Han Zhou had eagerly agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">On one hand, he had long anticipated subjecting others to the brutality of mechanical strikes. On the other, he wanted to use Ning Zhuo as a conduit to inflict bitter cold energy on others, thereby securing additional opportunities to pass on his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Yet after the battle, Ning Zhuo had rescued Hua Guzi and driven away her bitter cold energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly and explained to Han Zhou that he didn't want to be overly forceful, bullying a weak woman. He hadn't wished true hostility upon Hua Guzi; their interactions were always meant as sparring sessions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He'd offered Hua Guzi a cup of warm autumn wine merely to cultivate good karma with her, not wishing to strain his relationship with those around him too much while traveling afarâ€”after all, it's far better to have friends than enemies when you're on the road.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Han Zhou couldn't help but sigh. "Ning Zhuo truly possesses the noble bearing expected of a great clan. But I'm afraid you may not fully understand how Hua Guzi has always been arrogant and eccentric, holding grudges and retaliating against anyone who wrongs herâ€”even more so because she is half-human, half-demon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"If you treat her thusly, she will not reciprocate your kindness, instead intensifying her hatred toward you and seeking vengeance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo blinked slightly, then quickly displayed a questioning expression. Just as he was about to ask further, something flew toward them from nearbyâ€”a lantern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be Hua Guzi, moving forward with her billowing wide skirt fluttering in the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Hua Guzi flew directly toward Ning Zhuo, her gaze fixed on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Han Zhou and Ning Zhuo instantly prepared for battle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Ning Zhuo, please accept this gift!" However, after arriving before Ning Zhuo, Hua Guzi halted abruptly, bowed deeply, and presented a plate of dumplings with both hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo and Han Zhou were stunned, unsure what Hua Guzi was up to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo's guard rose as he mentally scanned these dumplings and Hua Guzi, his first instinct beingâ€”could it be that these dumplings have been poisoned?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">But then he dismissed this conjecture almost immediately. Even if they had been poisoned, there was no reason for Hua Guzi to poison them in front of him like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">What exactly was going on with Hua Guzi?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo assumed that she was experiencing some kind of difficulty and wanted his help. He promptly said, "Fellow Daoist Hua, let us discuss elsewhere."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Unexpectedly, Hua Guzi remained bowing, face still pressed against the ground, without so much as moving an inch. "I beg Young Master Ning Zhuo to accept my token of appreciation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo blinked in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He sent his consciousness out to scan their surroundings and found that they were alone enough for him to use his trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Divine abilityâ€”Thread of Life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Magical artifactâ€”the Head Buddha Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">In the following moment, Ning Zhuo felt many emotions from Hua Guzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Hua Guzi dared not lift her head to face Ning Zhuo, so her entire face was red as she lay parallel with the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">She roared internally:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Ahhhhh!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Why, why?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Dammit, I've finally done it this time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Hua Guzi, what are you doing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"You shameless thing! How could you treat a man like this? How could you degrade yourself so much?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"But, but..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"I-I feel so good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Just being this close to him makes me smell his scent, it's intoxicating!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Ning Zhuo is truly a man as delicate as a flower."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"How I long to receive another beating at his hands, to be pummeled by his controlled mechanical fists, then have his hand clamped over my mouth while he feeds me warm medicinal wine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo:?!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Although he could not sense Hua Guzi's clear thoughts, he could sense her surging and distorted emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo subconsciously took a small step back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He felt a chill in his heart and looked down at Hua Guzi's petite back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"What's wrong with this woman?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">For a moment, Ning Zhuo couldn't figure out what Hua Guzi's intentions might be.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">To play it safe, he firmly declined her advances. "There's no need for such things, Fellow Daoist Hua. We're merely exchanging techniques; there's nothing owed between us. Even if it were that warming autumn wine, it was I who chose to offer it, never expecting repayment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
