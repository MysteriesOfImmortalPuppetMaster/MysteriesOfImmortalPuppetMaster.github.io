<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In fact, Heavy Array Peak was the very faction Shen Xi wanted to join. With Ning Zhuo helping him achieve this goal ahead of schedule, Shen Xi was naturally grateful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Of course, Shen Xi still had to participate in the Rising Clouds Minor Trial and the Flying Cloud Assembly, as his subsequent performance would determine his starting point within Heavy Array Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Wenren Yan was quite satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Her objective for this trip was to befriend Ning Zhuo ahead of time, while also probing and dropping hints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This objective had been accomplished perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo had taken the initiative to host a banquet, engaging in close communication with Wenren Yan and quickly building rapport. His mind was agile; he immediately understood Wenren Yan's intentions. Without making things difficult for her, he gave a clear response on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Not only did Wenren Yan achieve her original goal, but she also gained something extra: she had recruited Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Rising Clouds Minor Trial and Flying Cloud Assembly were major events for the Myriad Manifestations Sect to recruit talented youths from the outside. Within the sect, there were numerous forces and factions, leading to fierce competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Although Wenren Yan failed to recruit Ning Zhuo and was willing to keep watching him, she did not return empty-handed, having recruited a genius like Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">As for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">On one hand, he had grasped Wenren Yan's intentions during their first meeting and made arrangements in advance. Ultimately, he had a near-perfect first contact with her, forming good karma and allowing her to return with a better report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">On the other hand, Ning Zhuo also assisted Shen Xi. By scheming on his behalf and lifting him into Heavy Array Peak early, he had sold him a substantial favor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Shen Xi won, Wenren Yan won, and Ning Zhuo won too.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">A triple win!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">This was Ning Zhuo's mature, Righteous Path method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Wenren Yan returned to report her mission. The result she brought back similarly triggered sighs of emotion from Yin Changgeng and the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Chunyu Gui scratched his bearded cheek. "Looking at it this way, isn't the possibility that Ning Zhuo is a possessor or a reincarnated cultivator even higher?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"He is so well-versed in rules and human nature. It seemed like a casual banquet, but in reality, many cultivators wouldn't be able to see through it or execute it even in middle age."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Such an outstanding junior was truly rare to see!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">But if he were a former cultivator who had possessed a body or reincarnated, it would undoubtedly be easier to accept.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Following this event, Heavy Array Peak's probing of Ning Zhuo had yielded a result, and they chose to continue observing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Although Ning Zhuo had clearly stated he had no intention of joining Heavy Array Peak, the faction only paused their recruitment efforts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Even if a target cultivator had no intention of joining, if the future they displayed was too bright, Heavy Array Peak would often go all out, throwing down heavy sums of money or using other means to induce them to join.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The competition inside the Myriad Manifestations Sect was extremely intense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">After Shen Xi returned, he also felt deeply grateful to Ning Zhuo. He said to Su Lingkou, "Cousin, now you should understand that our choice to befriend Ning Zhuo was correct, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Su Lingkou nodded, but she was still somewhat unwilling to admit it fully. "Cousin, I feel like Ning Zhuo just did a favor that cost him nothing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Given your strength, temperament, and background, could it be that you wouldn't have been able to join Heavy Array Peak on your own?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"On the contrary, I feel the chances of you being rejected were minimal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Shen Xi smiled and nodded. "That is indeed true. Therefore, the favor Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo sold me wasn't large."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"But I accept this favor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"You haven't yet grasped the subtlety within this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Su Lingkou revealed a confused look. "Oh? What is it? Cousin, teach me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">She extended her slender jade-like fingers and gently tugged at Shen Xi's sleeve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Shen Xi took the opportunity to hold Su Lingkou's small hand, smiling gently. "You participated in almost the entire exchange between Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo and me. You should remember that I never mentioned in front of him that I wanted to join Heavy Array Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Su Lingkou nodded. "That is true. Ning Zhuo guessed your plan, Cousin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"But that wasn't hard to guess, was it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Cousin, you come from the Shen Family of the Nine Palaces Immortal City, and you are so skilled in formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"A genius as outstanding as you naturally wants to join the most powerful faction in the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Shen Xi shook his head slightly. "On the surface, that is true. In reality, joining a certain faction involves too many factors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"For instance, grudges and gratitude, or connections of interest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"There is also the internal competition and rivalry within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, as well as the schemes and factional stances among the cultivators of my batch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"The difficulty of guessing it correctly is much higher than you imagine, Cousin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Su Lingkou pouted. "Cousin, everything you say is right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Seeing his cousin still looked unconvinced, Shen Xi continued, "Even if Ning Zhuo guessed correctly, the favor I owe isn't huge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"But the goodwill he displayed is the subtle part."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Right in front of me, he clarified his attitude to Wenren Yan, a high-ranking member of Heavy Array Peak - that he would not join Heavy Array Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"This was a gesture of goodwill toward me, indicating that he and I are not direct competitors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"At the same time, this was a clever response to the fact that he had previously received my guidance and book, and then took first place in the Nine Twist Corridor Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Su Lingkou was struck dumb. She blinked three times subconsciously, finally realizing what she hadn't understood before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">In her view, an ordinary banquet actually contained so many deep meanings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="101"/>
<paragraph index="103">Shuyu Studio.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo walked into the Divination Room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">It was still a ruin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The mica stone walls on all four sides had long since turned to powder, leaving only the light barrier formed by the formation to keep out the Emerald Jade Lake water. Most of the formation patterns still remained above his head and beneath his feet, emitting a faint glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">In the center of the room, a deep blue water vortex floated quietly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The water vortex was large, occupying almost half the space of the room. Its rotation speed varied, sometimes rushing like a waterfall, sometimes gentle like silk. Every change in speed caused a slight tremor in the surrounding space - that was the page of the Luo Shu calculating on its own, maintaining the balance of this natural formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo broke into a smile. "Boss! Your Formation Dao attainment is truly powerful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He gave a thumbs-up to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Sun Lingtong laughed heartily, placing his hands on his hips and tilting his head back. "Of course!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo said, "Wait until we retrieve the Luo Shu. I'll use the Dao-Bearing Jade Page to return the Formation Dao True Intent to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong waved his hand, indifferent. "What's the rush! You need to participate in the Rising Clouds Minor Trial a lot right now. The current Myriad Manifestations Sect is full of opportunities. Go slap those geniuses in the face properly, hehe. Using my Formation Dao attainment is equivalent to you showing off on my behalf!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Possessing the Dao-Bearing Jade Page meant that True Intent could be transferred between cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">However, in the vast majority of cases, how could a cultivator easily pass on the results of their life's cultivation to another? If they lent it out, what if it wasn't returned?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">But for Sun and Ning, it was an exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The two had extraordinary trust in each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Sun Lingtong could lend his Formation Dao True Intent to Ning Zhuo, and Ning Zhuo could likewise take out any of his own True Intent to lend to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">It was just that currently, Ning Zhuo needed it more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">As for the future, Ning Zhuo would certainly return the Formation Dao True Intent to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Boss likes to steal. Without sufficient Formation Dao attainment, how can he infiltrate formations?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">This was a golden age of cultivation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">To protect their wealth, who didn't have a defensive formation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo would absolutely not feel at ease letting Sun Lingtong, with zero Formation Dao attainment, infiltrate other formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Perhaps during this time, I can practice diligently, combining various memories from the Demonic Souls to elevate the Formation Dao attainment significantly, and then return it to Boss."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Haha, treat it as the interest he collects for lending it to me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo had already made up his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong waved his hand. "Let's stop chatting. Come look at this water formation quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Mn!" Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The reason he absorbed Sun Lingtong's Formation Dao attainment and swept through the formation-type challenges in the Rising Clouds Minor Trial was precisely to break this water formation and seize the Luo Shu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Immediately, he took a few steps forward, standing before the water vortex. His gaze was calm as he extended his Divine Sense to carefully observe the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">As soon as his Divine Sense touched the water vortex, Ning Zhuo felt a massive resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">This was not an attack, nor was it rejection, but "deduction." The water vortex formation sensed the external intrusion and immediately triggered the formation core - the Luo Shu. The latter began frantic calculations in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">This caused the formation patterns to flow, the formation lines to restructure, and the formation eyes to shift positions. All of this was completed in a split second.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo's Divine Sense wanted to lock onto a formation eye, but as soon as the thought arose, that formation eye had already changed position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He wanted to trace a formation line, but as soon as he started, the formation line had already changed its path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He wanted to deduce the full picture of the formation, but just as a prototype formed, the formation had already transformed into something else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Too fast..." Ning Zhuo opened his eyes, fine beads of sweat seeping from his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He was already at the Master-level in Formation Dao. In nearly ten matches of the Rising Clouds Minor Trial, whether setting up or breaking formations, he had been successful every time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo had never encountered such a situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The water formation before him seemed to have its own life, its own consciousness, reacting even faster than he could.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Is this the power of a Dao Artifact..." Ning Zhuo murmured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Even if it was only a single page of the Luo Shu, Ning Zhuo's deductions and calculations were like displaying slight skill before an expert in its presence. If Ning Zhuo calculated one step, it calculated ten; if Ning Zhuo deduced one layer, it deduced ten layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but look at Sun Lingtong beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">It was only Sun Lingtong's Spirit Eyes talent that could see through the formation, even directly peering at the Luo Shu formation core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Boss's Spirit Eye talent is very simple. It's a pity that I started consulting classics back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City but haven't found any records that match Boss's talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Sun and Ning speculated that the Spirit Eyes were likely a brand-new talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo slowly closed his eyes, his Divine Sense probing in once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">This time, he relied on his Master-level intuition to assist his Divine Sense in probing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Efficiency increased greatly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Guided by intuition, his Divine Sense could actually briefly contend with the formation's evolution, occasionally even snatching the initiative to probe deeper into the water formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">But intuition could not be triggered every time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo's Divine Sense penetrated most of the water formation before becoming unsustainable, ultimately retreating in regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo opened his eyes, looking at the water formation before him, and clicked his tongue softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sun Lingtong asked, "Hehe, this water formation isn't easy to break, is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo's fighting spirit was aroused. He said with a face full of seriousness, "If I can't break the formation and retrieve the book even after absorbing your Formation Dao attainment, Boss, then I might as well smash my head against a wall and die."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Sun Lingtong also had ample confidence in Ning Zhuo and clenched his small fist. "Little Zhuo, you definitely can!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo sank his Divine Sense in once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">But this time, he allowed the water vortex formation to change constantly, no longer obsessed with making his Divine Sense penetrate deeper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He tried his best to "follow" the changes of the water vortex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">If it calculated a step, he followed a step; if it deduced a layer, he followed a layer. Not striving to be first, not rushing ahead, just following behind, quietly observing, silently recording.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">He quietly perceived, feeling the rhythm of the formation, the meter of the formation patterns, the fluctuations of the formation core...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">An hour later, Ning Zhuo opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">His face was slightly pale, and the consumption was significant, but his eyes shone with a bright light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Through long-term observation, he had adapted to the rhythm of the water formation's evolution and grasped a specific "feeling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">This feeling was not cold reasoning, but something derived from intuition, filled with spiritual charm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Sun Lingtong had previously used his Spirit Eye talent to observe. This water formation used the Luo Shu page as the core, the water vein spiritual energy as the source, and those broken magical artifacts as the base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The bronze star tracks of the Armillary Sphere, the incomplete counting chips of the Mystic Turtle Shell, and the rosewood frame of the abacus were all parts of the formation base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo's observation this time reconfirmed Sun Lingtong's previous accuracy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo exhaled a breath of turbid air and looked at Sun Lingtong. "Boss, I'm just about ready."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Sun Lingtong asked, "Do you need to rest?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo frowned and shook his head. "I finally found the 'feeling,' I don't want to let it slip away. The Master-level realm is still a struggle; it's better if we act according to the plan immediately!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Alright." Sun Lingtong immediately left the Divination Room and went to the central hub of the cave abode to control the entire cave abode's formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The formation began to operate slowly, eventually reaching full capacity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">A massive force surged toward the Divination Room, churning the flow of spiritual energy around the water vortex into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The water vortex formation was a natural formation formed by the Luo Shu's power spontaneously influencing its surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Its foundation lay in the treasures within the Divination Room. As it was hidden in the Divination Room, it was also under the coverage of the entire Shuyu Studio cave abode formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Now, the entire cave abode's formation was on Sun and Ning's side, drastically altering the environment of the Divination Room and strongly interfering with the few broken treasures inside the Luo Shu water formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">In this way, the foundation upon which the entire water formation was built was violently shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The operation of the water formation was severely contained!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Wait, the shape of the water formation even changed drastically, causing Sun Lingtong's pupils to shrink abruptly. If this wasn't handled well, the water formation might self-destruct. The commotion would be huge and would immediately attract other cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">That would be a big problem!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">But fortunately, the Luo Shu page showed its power again, actively adjusting the severely deformed water formation, pulling it back from the brink of self-destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">A sharp light exploded in Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Taking advantage of the moment the Luo Shu page was adjusting the water formation, he used various formation-breaking treasures in turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">A Revealing Talisman was pasted onto the formation lines, making the patterns clearly visible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Formation-Fixing Stakes were driven into the void around the water vortex, locking down the formation base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">A Formation-Traversing Shuttle shot out a pale azure light, shining toward the formation eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">A Source-Severing Axe hung above the water vortex, severing a portion of the formation source several times in succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">One by one, the formation-breaking treasures performed their respective duties, exerting force simultaneously!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">If it were Ning Zhuo before attempting the Nine Twist Corridor Formation, he would absolutely not have been able to be so skillful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The water vortex trembled violently, its rotation speed fluctuating wildly, the formation patterns flickering uncertainly. The Luo Shu was still calculating frantically, trying to adjust the formation to deal with these interferences - but the formation was dead, and the treasures were alive. No matter how fast it calculated, the formation couldn't adapt in time.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
