<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">On the very first night, a male consort was killed - and not just any consort, but one of the most powerful among them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Though Wen Ruanyu was shocked and furious, the incident rekindled his hope of rooting out the traitor. He sought out Ning Zhuo and invited him to accompany him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Jiao Ma, your strategy is working. Just one night in, and the traitor was forced to make a move."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">But Ning Zhuo remained calm and shook his head slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Let’s investigate first. We can't jump to conclusions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Would a traitor really strike on the first night?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">If it truly was the traitor, then he must have acted with absolute confidence in his methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">But if not, then any investigation at this point would miss the real target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Wen Ruanyu noticed Ning Zhuo’s unshaken demeanor and paused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Jiao Ma, it sounds like you have a different take?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"I'm not optimistic," Ning Zhuo replied frankly, and laid out his reasoning in full.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Wen Ruanyu was surprised again, then sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Your face may be different, but this calm, clear-headed way you respond - it really reminds me of Senior Sister Meng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This time, it was Ning Zhuo whose expression faltered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">But Wen Ruanyu didn’t notice. He tilted his head back with a long sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"These days, I’ve been thinking about Senior Sister Meng a lot. It must be from the pressure of this ghost tide weighing me down."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Especially after Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was killed… I’ve been full of doubt and forced to think about every possibility."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"So I keep asking myself: If Senior Sister Meng were still here, what would she do? Back then she didn’t have any diviners supporting her either - so how was she always so wise, so decisive?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo offered a few words of comfort. Then, feigning casual interest, he said:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Senior Wen, you’re different from the people of this city. You're from the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"If White Paper Immortal City really falls, even if you retreat, the sect wouldn't hold it against you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Wen Ruanyu gave him a long look, then shook his head with a bitter smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"You don’t understand. I’ve been stationed in this city for many years now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"At first, I was only here because of Senior Sister Meng’s orders. But over time, my attachment to this place deepened. I couldn’t bring myself to leave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"You may not know this, but the city lord's true body is ailing. Even though she has paper clones, she doesn’t show herself unless it’s something truly serious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Normally, I handle internal affairs in the city, while Tie Guzheng oversees its defenses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Much of the city’s infrastructure was based on my ideas - or built with my own hands."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Take the Ink Pool, for example. It was indeed Senior Sister Meng’s design, but over the years it’s broken down more than ten times. Every time, I was the one who organized repairs and upgrades."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo was curious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"I'm no Confucian cultivator, but I’ve read a bit. Is the Ink Pool really that fragile?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Wen Ruanyu shared the hidden truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"There’s a saying - ‘the land shapes the people.’ The ghostman clans have lived and bred in this region for generations. Their nature is shadowy, combative - more like savages than anything else. In the beginning, they were impossible to manage. Peaceful coexistence with the human race was out of the question."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"What you see today - the social structure of White Paper Immortal City and the ghostman villages across this mist-laden marshland - it's all thanks to the Ink Pool."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"We altered the composition of the Ink Pool's waters, turning it into the main drinking source for the city and surrounding settlements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Over time, that water infused the ghostmen with a sense of culture. Their violent instincts dulled. They became gentler, more refined. Only then could we open schools and academies, teach them language and knowledge, and help them flourish."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Of course, the ghostmen resisted. For a long time, they tried every means to sabotage the Ink Pool - and they succeeded, more than once."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo listened intently, a new question forming in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Then... before Senior Meng came to this city, it must have looked very different?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Wen Ruanyu nodded without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Absolutely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"When I first followed her here, it was a desolate place. Barely inhabited. The ambient yin energy was overwhelming - almost like the underworld itself. And the ghost tides made it even worse. What sane cultivator would willingly settle here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Humans made up the bulk of the population. Ghostmen were few, and due to their cruel, violent nature, they were watched closely - most of them lived as slaves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Senior Sister Meng was born with a compassionate heart. She treated all beings with equal respect. That’s what I admired most about her."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Not long after she arrived, she assessed the situation and told us she had a plan to revitalize the city."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"She planned to use the power of the ghostmen?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Wen Ruanyu chuckled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Exactly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"The ghostmen are half-yin, half-yang - perfectly attuned to this marshland."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"They’re far better suited to life here than humans. They can even enter the Underworld Flood Dragon River and explore the underworld itself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"But their numbers and strength were kept tightly suppressed by human cultivators. And there weren’t enough humans here to govern the region on their own. Senior Sister Meng saw that as a tremendous waste."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"So she consulted us, and ultimately chose a Confucian path - establishing the Ink Pool to civilize the ghostmen. To free them from their savage ways and make them the true backbone of this land’s governance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A surge of admiration rose in Ning Zhuo’s heart. “This Senior Meng… she’s incredible. ‘The water shapes the people,’ and she actually changed the water to reshape the culture of this entire region. That kind of foresight and vision truly commands respect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He turned to Wen Ruanyu. “But of course, without your perseverance and dedication, Senior Wen, there would be no such success in civilizing White Paper Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Wen Ruanyu was clearly pleased, both by Ning Zhuo’s reverence for Meng Yaoyin and his praise of himself. “It’s precisely thanks to the long-term influence of the Ink Pool that we were able to gradually loosen our restrictions on the ghostmen. We supported them, encouraged their growth, and employed them as the primary labor force to build up this shadowy, damp marshland.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“I oversaw city governance, and deliberately developed a network of villages and towns around the city. Each one is rooted in a few human cultivators, with the majority of the population being ghostmen.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Today, our sphere of influence spans forty percent of the marshland.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“This time, when White Paper Immortal City faced the threat of destruction, the City Lord gave a single command - and so many forces rushed to our aid. I can’t deny I felt deeply gratified.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Granted, some of that is due to the generous rewards offered by the City Lord. But it also proves that our teachings have truly taken root. Human or ghostman alike, their hearts are aligned with White Paper Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">This conversation gave Ning Zhuo a much deeper understanding of the city's history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">While they talked, the two had already arrived at the scene of the incident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Shen Bing’s body still lay where it had fallen, intentionally left undisturbed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Wen Ruanyu looked to Ning Zhuo. The latter extended his hand in a polite gesture for him to proceed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Wen Ruanyu then activated a detection spell. The results came quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Shen Bing suffered two fatal wounds,” he reported.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“One at the neck, the other at the heart.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Though his neck appears intact, with no visible trauma, all vital force has been severed - effectively, a beheading.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“As for his chest, there’s a Black Iron Piercing Needle embedded straight through the heart. That too would’ve been lethal.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Noticing the change in Wen Ruanyu’s expression, Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred. “Senior Wen, you seem to have a suspicion already?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Wen Ruanyu sighed. “Yes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“These strange injuries immediately made me think of Chen Sui’s Harvest Slash technique.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“And the Black Iron Piercing Needle is a well-known weapon of Sun Tiesheng.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Shen Bing, Chen Sui, and Sun Tiesheng - those three were the strongest cultivators of the Vigorous Yang Manor. Now Shen Bing was dead, and all clues pointed squarely at Chen Sui and Sun Tiesheng. This conclusion left Wen Ruanyu visibly unsettled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">For a moment, Ning Zhuo too was silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Eventually, Wen Ruanyu broke the silence with a bitter sigh. “You know, I don’t even dare to let those two walk through the Plain Inquiry: Heart-Piercing Volume.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">That scripture could determine whether someone was lying, and once detected, would sever their life force. It was a fearsome thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo let out a breath. “I strongly suspect this is the work of the mole, manipulating things from the shadows.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“This is a layered trap.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“Chen Sui and Sun Tiesheng may have been compromised, pushed into acting.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“If our investigation confirms that, wouldn’t we be forced to punish them? Life for a life is the simplest solution.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“But if we do that, we’re playing right into the mole’s hands - he’ll have used us to eliminate Chen Sui and Sun Tiesheng.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“If we don’t, how will the people accept it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“So no matter what we choose, it will shake morale and fracture unity within White Paper Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Wen Ruanyu nodded. “I have no proof, but I agree with your judgment, Jiao Ma.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“After clashing with this mole a few times, I’ve grown increasingly impressed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“His strength and cunning are both top-tier.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Jin Yangzi is dead, and now Shen Bing too. If we end up executing Chen Sui and Sun Tiesheng, Vigorous Yang Manor will be gutted.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“That would devastate its morale.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">After saying this, both men fell silent once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The mole’s tactics were too effective. Even knowing there might be a lead, they didn’t dare pursue it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Because both of them had to consider the bigger picture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">To investigate further would be to harm their own side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo clapped his hands softly in admiration. “We tried to pressure him with the Golden Swallow Trident and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s grand strategy. Seems the mole saw right through it - and now he’s using the same tactics, turning them back on us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Incredible. Just incredible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Wen Ruanyu frowned. “So what should we do now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo paused for a moment, then opened his hands. “We wait and keep still. To launch an investigation rashly would be handing weapons to the enemy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“But we still hold the initiative.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“As long as the Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation stays in place, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord will keep pressing the traitor on his end.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“For now, we tighten our surveillance on Chen Sui and Sun Tiesheng. I refuse to believe he can keep acting without leaving a single flaw.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Wen Ruanyu considered this for a moment, then gave a helpless smile. “That’s all we can do.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Chen Sui’s residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“What?!” Chen Sui’s eyes widened in fury. He tore the flying message in half and roared, “Who’s mimicking my Harvest Slash Technique to frame me?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Shen Bing is dead. My biggest rival for the Golden Swallow Trident is gone. That only leaves Sun Tiesheng - he must be the one behind this!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“The Sun clan… of course. A vast clan with deep resources, while I’m just a lone cultivator. They had the method prepared, and even someone trained to use it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“The Black Iron Piercing Needle I stole was left in Shen Bing’s body. When is Wen Ruanyu planning to arrest Sun Tiesheng?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Sun Tiesheng’s residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">After hearing the report, Sun Tiesheng slammed the table and bellowed, “Curse that Chen Sui! That Black Iron Piercing Needle - I'll never forget - I lost it right after sparring with him!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“And now my clan’s preparation, even down to having an elder practice the Harvest Slash Technique, has given him the chance to sow confusion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Tell the clan to come up with another plan!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Right now, in the entirety of Vigorous Yang Manor, only Chen Sui and I stand a real chance. If I claim the Golden Swallow Trident, I’ll repay the clan handsomely!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The servant hesitated. “My lord, Shen Bing just died. If we act now, it’ll look like we’re openly defying heaven’s will.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Sun Tiesheng laughed loudly, brimming with confidence. “Claiming the Golden Swallow Trident as one’s own isn't something just anyone can do. Jin Yangzi is dead, and now Shen Bing too - only Chen Sui is left, a solitary orphan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“I’m the strongest contender now. White Paper Immortal City is facing ghost tides, and the Underworld Army is camped nearby, watching like tigers stalking prey. Do you think they dare move against me? Aren’t they afraid the Golden Swallow Trident will remain masterless?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Back at his quarters, Ning Zhuo returned to cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">With four Nascent Soul–level artifacts cycling in succession, the strength of his soul had surged to nearly 800,000 Man Soul - a meteoric rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“Boss, you really don’t want to use this method to refine your soul? Once this chance is gone, it won’t come again,” Ning Zhuo couldn’t help trying again, reaching out to persuade Sun Lingtong through Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">But Sun Lingtong declined without hesitation. “Little Zhuo, don’t bother. I’m stuck at the final step before reaching Golden Core. Once I break through, I’ll be ready to tackle this kind of bitter work!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“Hee hee.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">“Look who’s here? Your little girlfriend.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">As a master of the Life Hanging by a Thread technique, Ning Zhuo was naturally aware of Sun Lingtong’s surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">She was now within the ghost-soldier encampment, though positioned along the outer edge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Through Sun Lington’s eyes, Ning Zhuo saw a group of cultivators making a bold nighttime raid on the enemy camp. He couldn’t help but be impressed. These people had guts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“Follow me - charge!!!” Qing Yan led the charge at full gallop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">His daughter Qing Chi followed close behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Until now, White Paper Immortal City had only sent out small raiding teams to harass Forgetful River’s ghost army - never a full frontal assault like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">As a result, the ghost army was caught completely off guard by the sudden strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">By the time they gathered themselves and mounted a counterattack, Qing Yan’s group had already made their mark and retreated at leisure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">At the rear, Qing Chi turned back and thrust out both palms, unleashing a surge of green flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Under that fire, countless ghost soldiers screamed and perished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Seeing this through Sun Lingtong’s eyes, Ning Zhuo was startled. “Your little girlfriend’s no pushover. That move alone is at the Golden Core level!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">On the way back from their raid, Qing Chi whispered to her father through a voice transmission, “Dad, don’t forget - if I fight with all I’ve got, you have to support me in courting Jiao Ma!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Qing Yan gave a cold snort. “I said, you’d need to earn the merit first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Qing Chi rubbed her fists, full of eagerness. “Just some merit? I’ll rack it up in no time!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">That night, the Forgetful River’s ghost army passed the hours in anxious dread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Ning Zhuo spent the night immersed in tireless cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Vigorous Yang Manor passed the night in uneasy peace - only for dawn to bring sudden chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">“Someone’s dead! Someone’s dead!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Chen Sui was dead.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
