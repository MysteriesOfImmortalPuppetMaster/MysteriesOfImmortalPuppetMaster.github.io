<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo did not conceal anything from the three generals, and told them the wondrous uses and might of the formation.<br/>
<br/>
This elicited deep sighs from Liu, Guan, and Zhang: “After all, Ning Zhuo is from a great clan, with extraordinary foundations!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly. “It’s just that I’m not skilled in this formation. I rarely practice it. In real battle, I fear it might be difficult to successfully deploy.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er nodded. “We must be cautious! If the formation fails to be unleashed, it will cause backlash. Officers and soldiers are linked as one, and all will suffer.”<br/>
<br/>
By the time Liu, Guan, Zhang, Ning, and Sun formally deployed their troops, the soldiers’ appearances had already changed dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
Their bodies became tall and slender, at least seven feet high. They had snake heads on human bodies, and their skin was replaced by black scales. As they marched, they made very little noise, and light breezes circled their wrists and ankles.<br/>
<br/>
There was a clear orange-red bloodline on their backs, starting at the top of their heads and continuing straight down to the tailbone.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang tried to keep training the troops further, but saw little result, so they decisively stopped and began to move out.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai was very strong. They needed to move quickly and strive to join with others.<br/>
<br/>
A single-file snake formation.<br/>
<br/>
The lineup was stretched out, stamina was doubled, and there was also a certain defensive bonus. This mobile formation was perfectly suited for marching.<br/>
<br/>
After half a day’s march, they arrived before a valley.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er suddenly frowned and raised his hand, stopping the army. “My heart is pounding wildly with a bad feeling. I fear there is an ambush ahead!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei said, “But we have already sent out scouts. They entered the valley early to explore, and found nothing.”<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo heard this, he took it very seriously.<br/>
<br/>
His Life Thread technique could not settle on Liu Er’s head, making Ning Zhuo constantly hold Liu Er in high regard.<br/>
<br/>
Right now Ning Zhuo’s consciousness was inside the painting, while the mechanical ring was worn on his physical body’s finger and could not be brought here. Unless his physical body faced danger, there would be an early warning. As for anything inside the painting, the mechanical ring provided no protection.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately said, “Then let us go around this valley.”<br/>
<br/>
“All right.” Liu Er promptly gave the order, maneuvering the army and changing direction.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Liu, Guan, and Zhang about to shift position, a battle flag indeed rose on the mountain, revealing an army.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers in this army were each shrouded in black mist. Inside the mist, their limbs were blurred, and their faces could not be seen clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai stood at the mountaintop, looking down on Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning. He spoke softly but his voice covered all around: “Since you gentlemen have come, then all of you stay.”<br/>
<br/>
“Not good, it’s Ma Liangcai!”<br/>
<br/>
“Retreat at once.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s expression changed, and he immediately ordered the entire army to withdraw.<br/>
<br/>
Facing a powerful enemy while they were weak, this was indeed wise.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers were not alive. In the dull atmosphere, they withdrew with orderly discipline.<br/>
<br/>
What surprised Ning Zhuo was that Ma Liangcai watched the three generals’ camp leave in silence, and did not lead his troops to chase.<br/>
<br/>
He was calm and at ease, hands folded behind his back, standing proudly at the mountaintop, merely ordering the troops to form a battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers on the mountain began to move, forming several streams of people that were distinctly separated, and then they interwove continuously among each other.<br/>
<br/>
After a dozen or so breaths, the formation was established. Waves of power resembling black smoke rose gently from the top of each soldier’s head.<br/>
<br/>
The plumes of smoke converged in midair, forming a pitch-black mass.<br/>
<br/>
At first it was only vapor, but as it accumulated more and more, it began to liquefy into a large blob of ink.<br/>
<br/>
The surface of the ink gradually condensed, turning into a jet-black basin.<br/>
<br/>
An Ink Pool Formation!<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai took out his magic-weapon-grade writing brush, raised it slightly, and aimed the brush tip at the retreating three generals’ camp.<br/>
<br/>
With a casual wave of his hand, a black brushstroke in the shape of a single character appeared in midair.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, the ink pool high in the sky dropped its water level by one-tenth.<br/>
<br/>
“Watch out!” Liu Er shouted a warning.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a surge of pitch-black waves arose around the three generals’ camp. The strong smell of ink filled the air, rushing at them.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning struck simultaneously, combined with the power of the army, shattering the waves.<br/>
<br/>
But Ma Liangcai continually waved his brush, launching one mighty ink wave after another, forming an unending barrage.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning were all weaker in cultivation than Ma Liangcai, and they were barely holding on.<br/>
<br/>
They fought as they retreated, trying to widen the distance.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai laughed aloud. “Naive!”<br/>
<br/>
He raised the brush upright, extending his arm forward. With a strong push of his fingers, the brush tip drew in the air.<br/>
<br/>
As he exerted himself, the ink pool’s water level suddenly dropped by thirty percent.<br/>
<br/>
Ahead on the path of the three generals’ retreat, a huge trench appeared. Ink and smoke coiled inside it, and ordinary soldiers found it nearly impossible to cross.<br/>
<br/>
“This is bad!” Liu, Guan, Zhang, Ning, and Sun all felt their hearts sink.<br/>
<br/>
Their army’s combat strength was too weak, definitely not a match for Ma Liangcai.<br/>
<br/>
“I will take command of the battle formation!” Ning Zhuo gave a low shout.<br/>
<br/>
The three generals had already built trust with him and immediately yielded the leading position.<br/>
<br/>
Light Breeze of Thieves Formation!<br/>
<br/>
A gentle breeze swirled around, boosting the speed of the three generals’ camp.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo directed the troops forward. He was not foolish enough to try crossing the trench of smoky ink; instead, he moved to the left, trying to skirt around the obstacle.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai attacked again and again, but Ning Zhuo’s skillful maneuvering of the formation allowed the three generals’ camp to dodge the brunt of the offensive and gradually open up a gap.<br/>
<br/>
“How interesting. What formation is this?” It was the first time Ma Liangcai had seen the Light Breeze of Thieves Formation, and he was quite curious, so he asked at once.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei, using his loud voice, directly shouted back, “It’s the Swift Gale Lightening Formation! You don’t even know such a formation, Ma Liangcai? So you’re just that mediocre.”<br/>
<br/>
“Swift Gale Lightening Formation?” Ma Liangcai nodded solemnly. “I’ll remember that.”<br/>
<br/>
With the help of this formation, the three generals’ camp greatly increased its marching speed.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai’s attack had a certain range, and seeing that the three generals’ camp was about to leave that range, he promptly led his own army down the mountain, pursuing them.<br/>
<br/>
One side chased, the other fled.<br/>
<br/>
Before long, the Red Flower Camp’s banner fluttered in the wind, coming into everyone’s view.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan was riding a tall horse, and each of her soldiers wore bright red flowers on their heads or bodies.<br/>
<br/>
She, too, was on the march.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the three generals’ camp being pursued by Ma Liangcai, Mulan scouted for a moment. Then she waved her hand, and the Red Flower Camp joined the battle.<br/>
<br/>
Red Flower Battle Formation!<br/>
<br/>
This was Mulan’s most familiar and strongest formation.<br/>
<br/>
A gigantic red flower manifestation appeared above the Red Flower Camp and charged straight at Ma Liangcai’s Ink Smoke Army.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this opportunity, Liu, Guan, and Zhang immediately changed their strategy, directing their troops to turn around and strike back.<br/>
<br/>
In that open land, the three armies clashed head-on.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai wielded his brush, either pointing or sweeping, constantly shaping the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
In the short span of a dozen breaths, he had already created numerous trenches on the flat ground, then raised his own side’s terrain to form a small sloping hill.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai kept painting, producing barriers and stakes, and even creating an entire encampment!<br/>
<br/>
The water level in the ink pool manifestation dropped drastically, but it was replenished every moment by the support of the entire army, letting the water level continuously rise again.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai held the defensive position, while the three generals’ camp and the Red Flower Camp attacked from left and right, surrounding the hillside fortress.<br/>
<br/>
They could not break through for a long time!<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai combined painting with the formation. With each stroke of the brush, he reworked the battlefield, unleashing grand assaults and treating the entire battlefield like a canvas for his freehand.<br/>
<br/>
“No wonder he’s a famed general of the Two Note states.”<br/>
<br/>
“How formidable!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang all wore solemn expressions. In the fierce engagement, they quickly sensed how powerful Ma Liangcai was.<br/>
<br/>
During the fight, the White Jade Camp and the Golden Halberd Army arrived one after the other.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing and Sun Gan both chose to stand by and watch, not sending their armies into the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan, Liu Er, and others used voice transmissions through their divine senses but failed to persuade either of them.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing made excuses, saying he needed to observe carefully, to detect flaws in the Ink Smoke Army and then launch a single decisive attack to establish victory.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan, on the other hand, said he had to watch Shuang Jing and guard against the White Jade Camp’s ill intentions toward him, and also pressed Mulan to consider letting him become her husband as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan sneered repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
She was strong-willed by nature. The more others tried to pressure her, the less she would yield.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan and Shuang Jing both knew Mulan’s temperament.<br/>
<br/>
They both intended to use this moment to force this warrior’s daughter to submit. If she were to take charge of the General’s Office in the future, then a wife should naturally follow a husband’s every word.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan waved her battle flag, commanding the battle formation to make a new shift.<br/>
<br/>
The red flower manifestation suddenly flew out, straight toward the ink pool manifestation, wrapping around it.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai felt his connection drastically weaken, nearly severed.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately flourished his brush, unleashing a technique —“Writing in Swift Strokes!”<br/>
<br/>
He splashed ink across the air, and the jet-black strokes transformed into a dragon and a horned serpent.<br/>
<br/>
Dragon and serpent joined forces, drilling through the red flower manifestation, allowing the ink pool manifestation to stabilize again.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan’s face went pale, and her body swayed, almost falling from her horse.<br/>
<br/>
Her attempt had failed, so she quickly maneuvered the formation and pulled back the red flower manifestation.<br/>
<br/>
A large hole had been torn through the red flower manifestation. It returned above the Red Flower Camp, immediately drawing on the army’s strength for emergency repairs.<br/>
<br/>
During this time, the Red Flower Camp’s forces drained continuously, causing a massive decline in overall combat power.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai was highly alert and seized this opening. He led the Ink Smoke Army out of the encampment, shifting to the offensive.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Camp’s defenses collapsed one after another, forced to fight and retreat, resembling the earlier situation of the three generals’ camp.<br/>
<br/>
The Ink Smoke Army, like a pack of hungry wolves, kept gnawing at the Red Flower Camp, inflicting huge losses and great distress upon Mulan’s troops.<br/>
<br/>
Sensing the turn for the worse, Shuang Jing and Sun Gan quickly mobilized their forces to join the rescue.<br/>
<br/>
The White Jade plaque subdued the smoke, while the Golden Halberd manifestation was extremely sharp, piercing the ink pool and causing black ink to spill out.<br/>
<br/>
With these two fresh armies added, the Red Flower Camp escaped danger.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai laughed softly, as though he had expected this. He then continued to draw, creating fortifications and forging a defensive perimeter.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the White Jade Camp and the Golden Halberd Army encircled the Ink Smoke Army from left and right, while the three generals’ camp and the Red Flower Camp took a moment to rest.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after, four armies spread out to the east, south, west, and north, besieging the Ink Smoke Army.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai felt the mounting pressure and laughed heartily. “Everyone, behold my divine power.”<br/>
<br/>
Divine ability —“Ink Brush Conquest!”<br/>
<br/>
At once, the ink pool overturned, pouring out nearly all its ink.<br/>
<br/>
Ink rained down in torrents, splattering across the ground. It transformed into a massive group of iron cavalry.<br/>
<br/>
The iron cavalry charged, unstoppable!<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Camp was first in their path. Several lines of defense collapsed like paper, one after another.<br/>
<br/>
The iron cavalry rampaged all the way into the central ranks, forcing Mulan to personally engage.<br/>
<br/>
With the commander entangled, the Red Flower Battle Formation’s operations were greatly hampered, and the red flower manifestation’s power visibly plummeted.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the danger, Liu Er shouted, “Hurry and save General Mulan!”<br/>
<br/>
The three generals’ camp shifted course and rushed to the most critical part of the battle.<br/>
<br/>
However, Shuang Jing and Sun Gan took different actions. Almost simultaneously, they threw their full strength into assaulting the encampment.<br/>
<br/>
The encampment housed the Ink Smoke Army. If that force was seriously damaged, then no matter how strong Ma Liangcai was, he would be no match for the Golden Halberd Army or the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
As for Mulan…<br/>
<br/>
Let her lose!<br/>
<br/>
This was not a real battlefield, only a “testing generals” painting.<br/>
<br/>
“If Mulan is defeated and forced out, then to keep her Red Flower Camp, she must choose the victor as her husband!” Sun Gan’s eyes glinted. “And in the end, that victor must be me!”<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai had nearly exhausted the ink in order to crush the Red Flower Camp, exposing a weakness.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan clung to that advantage tightly.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan coughed up blood repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
She was already wounded and in poor condition. Now, trapped in a fierce battle while trying to guide the Red Flower Formation, she was overstretched and could not hold out.<br/>
<br/>
A single stroke, drawn with a hooked tip!<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai gripped his brush and aimed from afar at Mulan, giving a light pull.<br/>
<br/>
The ink acted like a blade and struck abruptly, slicing Mulan in two, causing her to be “killed” and forced out of the battle!<br/>
<br/>
“Damn!” Liu Er and the others felt a chill in their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
On this battlefield, the only trustworthy ally was the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
With Mulan “dead,” some of her troops tried to stand their ground while others fled in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
“Hurry and absorb these forces!” Ning Zhuo called loudly.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was startled awake, and he quickly led his entire army to take on Ma Liangcai’s assault while accepting the scattered survivors of the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai did not focus on the three generals’ camp, instead pulling back to race toward the encampment for urgent reinforcements.<br/>
<br/>
Divine ability —“Ink Abiding the Rules!”<br/>
<br/>
The ink dispersed, transforming into a set of rules that fortified the battlefield and affected both friend and foe.<br/>
<br/>
Under the rules Ma Liangcai established, defenders’ power increased by thirty percent, while attackers’ power decreased by thirty percent. This sixty percent gap immediately weakened Sun Gan and Shuang Jing’s offensive.<br/>
<br/>
They had nearly broken through the encampment, yet they were abruptly pushed back by Ma Liangcai’s effort to regain his footing.<br/>
<br/>
“That bastard actually cultivated ‘Ink Abiding the Rules’ into a divine ability!” Sun Gan nearly gnashed his teeth to bits.<br/>
<br/>
This was unexpected information.<br/>
<br/>
If he had known beforehand, he would never have gone for the encampment and would instead have rushed to rescue the Red Flower Camp.<br/>
<br/>
From another angle, for the sake of fulfilling the king’s command, Ma Liangcai had made a firm resolve, even revealing this major secret without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
For a general like him, a hidden divine ability could change the tide of battle, catching the enemy off guard and establishing enormous merit.<br/>
<br/>
Showing it off now was tantamount to giving up the advantage it might bring in future battles.<br/>
<br/>
“You have a divine ability? Think I don’t?” Sun Gan roared, also invoking his own technique.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Halberd manifestation gleamed with a dazzling divine light, becoming extremely sharp as it descended from the sky, splitting the entire encampment lengthwise in two.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan was left panting, his army’s strength largely spent, and the Golden Halberd Army’s formation slowed.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing seized this opportunity, leading his troops forward to storm into the camp.<br/>
<br/>
The Ink Smoke Army had been under siege for a long time and was already exhausted, losing many soldiers in a short span.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai spat out blood from the corner of his mouth and sent a mental shout to Shuang Jing.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing sneered, seeing a chance.<br/>
<br/>
If he defeated Ma Liangcai here, he might well emerge as the final winner. Taking the post of Master of the General’s Office would no longer be a dream!<br/>
<br/>
Such an opportunity comes once in a lifetime. How could he not fight now?<br/>
<br/>
The White Jade Camp charged into the encampment, tangling with the Ink Smoke Army.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing howled repeatedly, pouncing on Ma Liangcai.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai did not want to be trapped, so he backed away continuously, trying to widen the distance. But the next instant, Sun Gan also advanced under the power of his troops, brandishing the Golden Halberd to attack alone.<br/>
<br/>
The three Nascent Soul cultivators battled inside the camp, their shockwaves enormous, killing countless soldiers from all sides.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang initially wanted to hold back and watch, but then they saw Ma Liangcai touch the tip of his brush to their own soldiers, detonating them into bursts of ink.<br/>
<br/>
Those bursts of ink then gathered again in midair, re-forming the ink pool manifestation.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing and Sun Gan went pale, since the manifestations of their own armies were already weak.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Liangcai sacrificed most of his troops and used a forbidden technique to once again unleash a torrent of ink.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing and Sun Gan staggered back in distress, fresh wounds appearing all over their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
Realizing the dire situation, Liu, Guan, and Zhang dared not remain on the sidelines. They rushed in to assist.<br/>
<br/>
“None of you even have a battle-formation manifestation, mere Gold Core cultivators!” Ma Liangcai was full of heroism, looking down on Liu, Guan, and Zhang. The tip of his brush was sharper than any blade, its head heavier than any hammer.<br/>
<br/>
After a round of fierce bloodshed, Ma Liangcai successively “killed” Shuang Jing, Sun Gan, Zhang Hei, and Guan Hong, and in the end, he used a single stroke to blow up Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
“I, Ma Liangcai, have not failed my king!” Ma Liangcai stood triumphantly over the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Only a few dozen soldiers remained on the field.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
A grand five-element spell struck the badly wounded Ma Liangcai, knocking him down.<br/>
<br/>
“You? Who are you?” Ma Liangcai looked at the man whose presence was augmented by the army, his aura surging up to the Nascent Soul level. Ma Liangcai was stunned.<br/>
<br/>
The Hero Returning Spell!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong laughed up at the sky, then fell backward onto the ground.<br/>
<br/>
He had not expected the final victory to come so easily.<br/>
<br/>
Boom, boom, boom!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurled more than a dozen spells in succession, blasting Ma Liangcai into pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the deep pit in the battlefield, Ning Zhuo then gave a slight smile and offered a salute to the pit. “I am Ning Zhuo, military advisor to the Three Generals’ Camp.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong voluntarily withdrew.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, with Ning Zhuo as the sole victor, he slowly opened his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan and the others wore extremely complicated expressions, their gazes dark and fierce, all fixed on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s eyes burned with excitement as he stared at Ning Zhuo, transmitting with his divine sense, “Military Advisor, you actually won! You stand for the Three Generals’ Camp in victory, so you have made a great contribution!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing was about to speak, intending to win Ning Zhuo over.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan suddenly spoke up. “Since that is the case, Young Master Ning Zhuo shall be my husband!”<br/>
<br/>
“Wait!” Ning Zhuo forced a bitter smile, raising his hand to halt. “To be honest, this is not what I want.”<br/>
<br/>
Mulan immediately became quite tense. She fixed her gaze on Ning Zhuo and used divine sense transmission. Uncharacteristically, she used a pleading tone, hoping he would think it over. She promised to give him ample compensation.<br/>
<br/>
The two of them exchanged words in secret, while the others all watched anxiously.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Ma Liangcai also joined the conversation, promising Ning Zhuo an enormous reward if he would give it up.<br/>
<br/>
Right in front of everyone, Ning Zhuo said that he was representing the Three Generals’ Camp in victory, and that the honor should belong to Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan, Ma Liangcai, Sun Gan, and Shuang Jing all opposed this.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of joke was that!<br/>
<br/>
In the end, letting a mixed-blood take the win—where would they save face?<br/>
<br/>
“Sir, what do we do?” Ning Zhuo felt utterly helpless, transmitting his question to Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s face was ashen as he stared at Ning Zhuo with a complicated look. After a long pause, he said, “Rather than yield to Ma Liangcai, let us accept this for now. Military Advisor, I beg of you.”<br/>
<br/>
“But I…” Ning Zhuo furrowed his brow, extremely conflicted. “My lord, you know how I feel.”<br/>
<br/>
“I understand!” Liu Er’s heart bled, but he forced himself to endure. “Military Advisor, please agree for the time being. Take that place and we’ll work out a plan afterward. Rest assured, I’ll give you ample compensation so you won’t be put in a difficult position!”<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong and Zhang Hei, who had witnessed it all, saw Liu Er make up his mind. They also urged Ning Zhuo, saying that if he helped in this matter, it would be a huge favor, and he would be greatly rewarded in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed and spoke with Mulan once more. In front of everyone, they agreed that he would only hold the title in name, and they must divorce in the future!<br/>
<br/>
Mulan felt a huge weight lifted from her heart. She dared not hesitate, and immediately nodded her consent.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Ning Zhuo, with no other choice, spread his hands and accepted this new status.</div>
