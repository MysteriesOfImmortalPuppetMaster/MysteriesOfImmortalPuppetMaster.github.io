<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The final checkpoint of the wide path.<br/>
<br/>
What filled Ning Zhuo's vision was a vivid crimson red.<br/>
<br/>
In the final checkpoint, the space was unexpectedly vast—like a sprawling prairie!<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, this checkpoint was constructed with some kind of spatial formation.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the checkpoint, the blood qi was extremely dense, drifting between heaven and earth, forming large patches of blood mist.<br/>
<br/>
The blood mist continuously flowed, with a gust of wind constantly swirling, making the blood mist sometimes thick and sometimes thin.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo explored within the blood mist, and after walking a certain distance, he noticed a faint light shining through the mist.<br/>
<br/>
He walked towards the light and arrived at the center of the room.<br/>
<br/>
Here, he saw a blood lake.<br/>
<br/>
It was the light from the surface of the blood lake that was shining.<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo stepped closer to the edge of the blood lake, the light on the surface of the lake suddenly retracted.<br/>
<br/>
On the lake's surface, Ning Zhuo's reflection appeared.<br/>
<br/>
The lake water began to ripple rapidly, like boiling water, bubbling and gurgling.<br/>
<br/>
A large mass of essence blood, as if it had a life of its own, surged upwards, bursting out of the lake and rushing towards Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly dodged.<br/>
<br/>
The essence blood landed on a rock at his feet, immediately enveloping it.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, it formed large patches of blood veins on the surface of the rock.<br/>
<br/>
The blood veins were extremely powerful, continuously molding the rock.<br/>
<br/>
With a series of cracking sounds, the rock was shaped into a puppet resembling Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Remarkably, it looked quite similar.<br/>
<br/>
Under the control and wrapping of the blood veins, the rock puppet charged silently towards Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The two engaged in a fierce battle by the blood lake.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly fell into a disadvantageous position.<br/>
<br/>
This was because the material of the rock puppet was far superior to his wooden body, made of materials at the Foundation Establishment level.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the rock puppet's martial skills were also far superior to Ning Zhuo's.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could only fight while retreating.<br/>
<br/>
Just as he was probing his opponent's capabilities, the blood lake stirred again.<br/>
<br/>
The essence blood from the lake surged ashore, successively attaching to the soil and trees.<br/>
<br/>
After a round of molding by the blood veins, they formed soil puppets and tree puppets.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Ning Zhuo faced a one-against-three predicament!<br/>
<br/>
After a round of exchanges, Ning Zhuo discovered that each puppet's martial skills far surpassed his own.<br/>
<br/>
This made Ning Zhuo both envious and determined, frantically urging his own blood qi.<br/>
<br/>
His blood qi was incredibly abundant, and the Blood Path Diagram embedded in his wooden body was a Foundation Establishment version taken from Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo clapped his palms together, and blood qi poured out like a flood, directly engulfing the three puppets.<br/>
<br/>
An hour later...<br/>
<br/>
The battlefield was littered with the remains of ineffective puppets, broken limbs, and severed heads.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could barely stand, extremely weak, but his heart was filled with relief and joy.<br/>
<br/>
"Finally, I won!"<br/>
<br/>
An hour-long battle was both long and arduous.<br/>
<br/>
Each of Ning Zhuo's puppet opponents was at the peak of the ninth level, just like him.<br/>
<br/>
"This time, my victory was not honorable."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo knew that his victory was entirely due to the overwhelming outpouring of blood qi, irrationally crushing his opponents.<br/>
<br/>
This was the best demonstration of brute force overcoming skill.<br/>
<br/>
He was able to achieve this thanks to Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng had created a Foundation Establishment level Blood Path Diagram, whose instantaneous outpouring of blood qi far exceeded that of a Qi Refining level Blood Path Diagram.<br/>
<br/>
In the second-to-last checkpoint, the Blood Path Diagram had absorbed a significant amount of blood qi.<br/>
<br/>
By the final checkpoint, Ning Zhuo recklessly squandered blood qi, showing no restraint.<br/>
<br/>
In the later stages, when his blood qi was nearly depleted, he would drain the Blood Path Diagram and use it to wildly absorb his opponents' blood qi, fighting battle after battle.<br/>
<br/>
In this way, Ning Zhuo almost had an infinite supply of blood qi.<br/>
<br/>
He used no techniques, just overwhelming amounts of blood qi to crush his opponents.<br/>
<br/>
One puppet after another fell, and more puppets rose from the blood lake.<br/>
<br/>
The puppets came in waves, pushing Ning Zhuo into a bitter struggle.<br/>
<br/>
"But in the end, I am the victor!"<br/>
<br/>
"When I have time to refine my martial skills in the future, I'll attempt this checkpoint again." Ning Zhuo opened the final door of the Demonic Gate path and entered the final reward room.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he stepped inside, he obtained the Foundation Establishment method of the Demonic Gate path.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast to the Buddhist Gate, the Foundation Establishment method here focused on the lower dantian's Essence Sea, with the other two dantians as supplementary.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not delve deeply into this Foundation Establishment method but immediately looked at the various position tokens hanging on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
After carefully browsing through them multiple times, he chose the position of the Commander of the Point General Platform.<br/>
<br/>
"Next is the Dao Gate path."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, now with abundant soul power, still had energy left after passing the final checkpoint of the Demonic Gate path.<br/>
<br/>
He used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal to retreat from the checkpoint and returned to the third central hall.<br/>
<br/>
Then he pushed open the third Dao Gate and charged forward with all his might.<br/>
<br/>
In the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's gaze pierced through the void, its expression complex as it watched Ning Zhuo's every move.<br/>
<br/>
It had previously considered hiding and delaying, but ultimately realized it could not stop Ning Zhuo from obtaining three different Foundation Establishment methods.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, it revealed the secrets of the Foundation Establishment methods in advance to gain Ning Zhuo's trust.<br/>
<br/>
"Our previous exchanges should have gone well!" "Especially the last time."<br/>
<br/>
"Although the whip hurt me, it was enough to earn Ning Zhuo's trust and gratitude." "Hehe, everything will turn out fine." "I will definitely gain my freedom!"<br/>
<br/>
While the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was encouraging itself, Ning Zhuo had already started a new challenge.<br/>
<br/>
As the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had introduced, the purpose of the Dao Gate path was to cultivate the spellcasting abilities of trial disciples.<br/>
<br/>
In the previous reward checkpoint, Ning Zhuo had obtained the Five Elements Transformation Disk.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the Transformation Disk became his main weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Holding the Five Elements Transformation Disk, he continuously cast Five Elements spells, sometimes attacking, sometimes defending.<br/>
<br/>
At regular intervals, a Five Elements spell would strike at him in this checkpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it was a metal blade, sometimes a water tide, and sometimes a fire blaze.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo needed to counter these spells with his own.<br/>
<br/>
To conserve more spiritual power, he would use the principle of mutual restraint.<br/>
<br/>
He used water spells to counter fire blazes and wood spells to counter earth's sand and stones.<br/>
<br/>
This approach was undoubtedly the most efficient in conserving spiritual power and mental energy.<br/>
<br/>
The Five Elements Transformation Disk allowed his internal spiritual power to transform into Five Elements mana.<br/>
<br/>
Using this mana to cast Five Elements spells was undoubtedly more efficient.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the Five Elements Transformation Disk had other uses.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, it was a formation disk.<br/>
<br/>
Once Ning Zhuo used it, it would extend an invisible formation outward.<br/>
<br/>
Within the coverage of this formation, the spiritual energy in the air would be influenced by the formation, and Ning Zhuo could change the flow of spiritual energy within the formation with a single thought.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, the Five Elements Transformation Disk was a combat tool that could alter or set up the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
"When my mastery of the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique improves in the future, the quality of the Five Elements Transformation Disk I can obtain will be higher." The method of obtaining the Five Elements Transformation Disk was similar to that of the Blood Path Diagram, primarily based on certain spells or techniques.<br/>
<br/>
The reward checkpoint after the second Dao Gate was the Five Elements Transformation Disk.<br/>
<br/>
The reward checkpoint after the third Demonic Gate was the Blood Path Diagram.<br/>
<br/>
The items from these two reward checkpoints could be obtained repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the reward checkpoint after the first Buddhist Gate was the same.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo had used Yuan Dasheng's resources to create the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng with immortal potential.<br/>
<br/>
The first Buddhist Gate's normal reward was a spiritual mechanical construct, which would eventually lose its spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, however, had been in use until now.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, trial disciples' spiritual mechanical constructs would be consumed after a period of use.<br/>
<br/>
The trial disciples would then re-enter the Buddhist Gate path to obtain the next construct.<br/>
<br/>
After struggling through the second-to-last checkpoint of the Dao Gate path, Ning Zhuo found it difficult to continue.<br/>
<br/>
His spiritual energy was less than thirty percent.<br/>
<br/>
"The difficulty of the second-to-last checkpoint is still too great for me." "I expended too much time, mental energy, and spiritual power in this checkpoint." Ning Zhuo had little confidence in the final checkpoint of the Dao Gate path.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he had just passed the final checkpoint of the Demonic Gate path, and his state was not at its peak.<br/>
<br/>
But out of curiosity, Ning Zhuo still pushed open the final door.<br/>
<br/>
As expected, he failed.<br/>
<br/>
After his soul returned to his body, Ning Zhuo came back to reality.<br/>
<br/>
He was floating among the clouds, his eyes tightly shut for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
He recalled his conversation with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit and thoroughly considered his current situation.<br/>
<br/>
The exchange with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had greatly benefited him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo verified the Foundation Establishment method and reached a deeper level of cooperation with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, he understood the main mechanism of the palace examination.<br/>
<br/>
"To quickly participate in the palace examination, I don't actually need to accumulate enough merit for a first-rank position." "After all, my merit is negative, and accumulating enough for a first-rank position would take too long." Mainly because he had previously blown up the Immortal Palace, resulting in a large negative merit, making it difficult to fill the gap.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo calculated in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, he only needed the qualification to participate in the palace examination.<br/>
<br/>
This meant he didn't need to strive for the top merit; he just needed to be within the top thirty-two.<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace, Medical Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's heart stirred as she discovered a new repair task.<br/>
<br/>
"It's that mechanical ape." Ning Xiaohui's eyes lit up.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo continuously passed through the Demonic Gate path and reached the final checkpoint of the Dao Gate path, Yuan Dasheng was also injured.<br/>
<br/>
Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo immediately issued the repair task for the Golden Blood Battle Ape to Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui promptly accepted the repair task.<br/>
<br/>
The teleportation circle swallowed and placed the Golden Blood Battle Ape on the workbench.<br/>
<br/>
After a thorough inspection, Ning Xiaohui was delighted to find that this time the Golden Blood Battle Ape's injuries were much lighter than before.<br/>
<br/>
After all, the previous injuries of the Golden Blood Battle Ape had accumulated over a long time.<br/>
<br/>
During the use of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, Ning Zhuo had only patched it up without fully understanding its mechanical structure, merely making temporary repairs.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the Golden Blood Battle Ape's injuries, Ning Xiaohui couldn't help but smile.<br/>
<br/>
In her view, the lighter injuries of the Golden Blood Battle Ape indicated that it had the upper hand in battle, inflicting more severe injuries on its opponents.<br/>
<br/>
"You should unleash your power more often!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui grew increasingly fond of the Golden Blood Battle Ape, finding it more and more imposing.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, the Golden Blood Battle Ape had given her many nightmares and countless embarrassing experiences, but now Ning Xiaohui had come to terms with it, and her feelings had completely changed.<br/>
<br/>
"After I repair you, I'll go find out who is suffering." "Properly making these trial disciples suffer a bit will help them grow." Ning Xiaohui couldn't help but laugh as she said this.</div>
