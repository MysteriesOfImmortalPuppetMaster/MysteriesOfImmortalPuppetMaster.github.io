<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
In the dense forest halfway up the mountain, Tu Ming revealed himself.<br/>
<br/>
He stood about seven feet tall, with a robust build and well-defined muscles.<br/>
<br/>
His skin was bronze-colored, clad in animal skins, barefoot, with a large snake coiled around his waist and back. The snake was dead, leaving only its carcass, but it still looked lifelike. The enormous snake head rested above Tu Ming's shoulder, making him appear especially terrifying.<br/>
<br/>
As the High Priest of the Hundred Poison Tribe, known as the Poison Belly, Tu Ming's accessories were mostly snake bones and viper scales, with snake fangs and venom sacs hanging from his necklace.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, he extended his withered fingers and gently pinched a small venom sac from his necklace.<br/>
<br/>
He pulled off the venom sac and infused it with spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the venom sac was restored and enlarged to the size of a palm, held by the Poison Belly High Priest in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming murmured softly, performed mouth seals, and chanted long incantations.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, his five fingers pressed and kneaded the venom sac continuously.<br/>
<br/>
His fingers were also bronze-colored, but the wrinkles and gaps between his fingers were pitch-black like iron.<br/>
<br/>
The kneading and squeezing of his fingers were not without pattern; it was as if five venomous snakes were entwining around the surface of the venom sac, twisting, moving, and stroking damply and coldly.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming's lips curled into a sinister smile, his gaze growing colder, emitting a merciless aura.<br/>
<br/>
Poison Art —Formless Poison!<br/>
<br/>
With mouth seals and finger seals combined, based on the use of the venom sac, he executed this move.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming was a Nascent Soul-level great cultivator; it had been many years since he had so solemnly and wholeheartedly cast a spell.<br/>
<br/>
The venom sac continued to deplete, gradually collapsing, eventually turning into a thin membrane.<br/>
<br/>
The invisible, odorless, and soundless poisonous gas, guided by Tu Ming's divine sense, drifted silently toward the foot of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
There, an army was trekking over mountains and through waters, marching swiftly —it was the Barbarian Demon Army of the Two Note Kingdom. The poisonous gas drifted into the army without any hindrance, spreading rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
The many barbarians and demon cultivators who inhaled the poison continued marching while chatting, laughing and cursing, some even quarreling, without the slightest awareness that death was approaching.<br/>
<br/>
"Old Ox, how was the taste of that snake demoness?"<br/>
<br/>
"What snake demoness? I don't understand what you're talking about!"<br/>
<br/>
"Don't pretend! Many people saw you sneaking into that female snake demon's tent for dual cultivation late last night. Look at you today, so obviously fatigued from marching —are you almost drained dry?"<br/>
<br/>
"What are you saying! I, Old Ox, am strong and vigorous; even after seventeen or eighteen rounds of dual cultivation in one night, I would still be full of energy, vigorous as a dragon, spirited as a horse..."<br/>
<br/>
Thud.<br/>
<br/>
Before he could finish his words, the ox-headed demon cultivator fell headfirst to the ground, expressionless.<br/>
<br/>
Dead.<br/>
<br/>
The demon cultivator who had just been talking to him reacted by laughing heartily: "Old Ox was boasting too much, he's exhausted himself —uh..."<br/>
<br/>
Thud.<br/>
<br/>
He also fell down, face calm, life lost.<br/>
<br/>
Thud, thud...<br/>
<br/>
A series of cultivators collapsed one after another, like stalks of wheat after a storm, falling patch after patch.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the Barbarian Demon Camp finally realized something was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivator responsible for vigilance sounded the alarm bell, shouting loudly: "Enemy attack! Enemy attack!!"<br/>
<br/>
Thud.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he also died.<br/>
<br/>
But the alarm bell was a magical instrument, still emitting a piercing alarm.<br/>
<br/>
"Bad news, General! Someone has poisoned us! We have over a hundred casualties already," a subordinate came to report.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali, sitting on a heavily armored rhinoceros, was greatly shocked. He quickly reached out, grabbed the long-handled war hammer hanging on his mount, and shouted: "Form ranks! Form ranks!"<br/>
<br/>
His voice was loud, stirring up waves of air that spread out. The inner circle of his personal guards understood the situation; the elite soldiers on the outer circle heard the commotion but didn't understand, casting puzzled looks.<br/>
<br/>
A subordinate hurriedly asked: "General, what formation should we arrange?"<br/>
<br/>
"Iron Bucket Formation! Arrange the Iron Bucket Formation first!" Xu Dali shouted.<br/>
<br/>
The subordinates around him immediately sprang into action; some held military flags, some arranged weapons, some issued orders.<br/>
<br/>
The Barbarian Demon Camp was like a bloated bear, awakened after bleeding and being injured. Its hairs stood on end, and they became vigilantly furious.<br/>
<br/>
At another mountainside.<br/>
<br/>
Two Nascent Soul-level barbarian cultivators stood side by side.<br/>
<br/>
One was Di Lu, eyes covered with black cloth, upper body bare, painted with blood-red totems, carrying two massive crescent moon scimitars on his back.<br/>
<br/>
The other was Gu Ya, with blue hair, wolf claw patterns on his cheeks, holding a ferocious wolf-fang mace.<br/>
<br/>
Both were of Nascent Soul level.<br/>
<br/>
Gu Ya stamped hard, plunging the wolf-fang mace into the mountain rock.<br/>
<br/>
He slightly raised his head, puffed up his chest, took a deep breath, then bit his finger, causing blood to flow.<br/>
<br/>
He dipped his finger in blood and smeared it along the wolf claw patterns on his cheeks and forehead.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he activated his spiritual energy, infusing it into the wolf claw patterns.<br/>
<br/>
The patterns, stimulated by both blood and spiritual energy, seemed to come alive, rapidly growing and spreading over Gu Ya's cheeks and chest.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, it extended down his legs and spread into the surrounding mountains.<br/>
<br/>
In no time, the blood-blue patterns formed complex, ancient designs, placing Gu Ya and Di Lu at the very center.<br/>
<br/>
Storage Formation —Beast Realm: Wolf Mountain!<br/>
<br/>
The blood-blue magic formation burst out with intense radiance, from which large packs of wolves charged forth.<br/>
<br/>
These ferocious mountain wolves had light gray, dark gray, and even gray-blue fur.<br/>
<br/>
They were all carefully raised by Gu Ya, possessing considerable strength; the vast majority were at the Qi Refining level, and the leaders were all at the Foundation Establishment level.<br/>
<br/>
There were three Golden Core-level commanders, each as big as a calf. After emerging from the formation, they did not charge but stood beside Gu Ya, guarding the main general.<br/>
<br/>
The wolf pack, like a tide, swooped down from the mountainside, forming a ferocious military force, sweeping toward the Barbarian Demon Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The Poison Belly High Priest Tu Ming, after performing his poison art, had been watching the Barbarian Demon Camp from afar.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the commotion in the Barbarian Demon Camp, attempting to form a formation, he couldn't help but sneer: "Iron Bucket Formation? Lu Hongtu was right; this Xu Dali lacks talent and doesn't know how to adapt. How can a mere Iron Bucket Formation withstand my Formless Poison?"<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Gu Ya also observed the movements of the Barbarian Demon Camp and frowned deeply.<br/>
<br/>
Once the Iron Bucket Battle Formation is formed, it would greatly increase the Barbarian Demon Camp's defense, making it extremely difficult for his wolf pack's assault.<br/>
<br/>
"If my Cangyue Tribe loses to the Hundred Poison Tribe, where is our face?"<br/>
<br/>
"The divine decree requires us to go all out, but if my wolf pack suffers too many losses, how will I face the main forces of the Two Note Kingdom in the future?"<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, Gu Ya immediately let out a long howl, spread his arms, and began dancing a war dance on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, this was casting spells through body seals.<br/>
<br/>
The blood-blue patterns on his body, with each of his primitive dance movements, left trails of blood-blue light in the air.<br/>
<br/>
The light trails intertwined, weaving into the shape of an altar.<br/>
<br/>
Gu Ya stepped onto the altar and performed his techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Beast Control Technique —Wolfs Run in the Wind!<br/>
<br/>
The Wolf Run Technique immediately took effect, greatly increasing the wolf pack's speed, rapidly shortening the charging distance.<br/>
<br/>
Beast control was one of the many arts of cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
In the Thousand Peaks Forest, Gu Ya and Ju Bing were known as the Pig and Wolf Beast Masters; both were well-known for their profound attainments in beast control techniques.<br/>
<br/>
The Barbarian Demon Camp fell into chaos.<br/>
<br/>
"Bad news! The wolf pack has accelerated!"<br/>
<br/>
"We won't have time to form the formation, General, what should we do?"<br/>
<br/>
The subordinates urgently reported.<br/>
<br/>
In the past few days, Xu Dali had also been diligent; as the main general, he maximized the training volume, but due to the large number of troops, the difficulty of training was very high, and when divided, the level of training was quite low.<br/>
<br/>
At this critical military moment, the Barbarian Demon Camp unsurprisingly fell short, unable to quickly form a formation.<br/>
<br/>
"Form the formation!" Xu Dali shouted loudly, his aura bursting forth, forming a wave of air.<br/>
<br/>
The airwave expanded rapidly, sweeping over the entire army within a few breaths.<br/>
<br/>
Military Tactic —Speed is of the Essence!<br/>
<br/>
As the main general of an army, Xu Dali naturally also practiced military tactics.<br/>
<br/>
He practiced the classic tactic "Speed is of the Essence" quite proficiently.<br/>
<br/>
The wolf pack charged even faster; under the blessing of the military tactic, the Barbarian Demon Camp's formation speed also increased.<br/>
<br/>
"Someone, hold them off for me; we will not retreat in this battle!" Xu Dali roared.<br/>
<br/>
His personal guards and elite soldiers around him all quickened their actions; the Iron Bucket Formation with them at the core began to take shape.<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general filled in Xu Dali's omissions and suggested: "Sir, should we request reinforcements from our allied forces?"<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali was reminded and quickly nodded: "Of course we need reinforcements; quickly request aid!"<br/>
<br/>
Awooo!<br/>
<br/>
The wolf pack officially clashed with the Barbarian Demon Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The roughly organized front lines of the Barbarian Demon Camp were like tofu dregs, easily torn apart and crushed by the wolf pack.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators of the Barbarian Demon Camp screamed miserably; after the clash, over a hundred were killed or wounded immediately!<br/>
<br/>
The front lines twisted and could not hold, being breached in several places.<br/>
<br/>
The wolf pack, like a flood, rushed through the breaches into the inner circle.<br/>
<br/>
But here, they hit an iron wall, and their offensive was obviously contained.<br/>
<br/>
Surrounding Xu Dali, his personal guards and elite soldiers had formed a compact Iron Bucket Formation.<br/>
<br/>
The battle formation gave every participating cultivator a massive defensive boost, making them like copper skin and iron bones; no matter how the mountain wolves bit and tore, it was hard to be effective.<br/>
<br/>
On the mountainside, Tu Ming's expression grew somewhat grave.<br/>
<br/>
The resilience of the Barbarian Demon Camp was somewhat beyond his expectations.<br/>
<br/>
He saw that the core of the Barbarian Demon Camp had stabilized, and although the majority of the cultivators outside the core were retreating step by step, it was only due to the fierce assault of the wolf pack.<br/>
<br/>
Few of them were panicking; most were indignant after being attacked, wanting to retaliate.<br/>
<br/>
"The morale of the Barbarian Demon Camp is still usable!"<br/>
<br/>
"Gu Ya is too impatient, hindering my plan to disturb their morale."<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming became dissatisfied with Gu Ya.<br/>
<br/>
His Formless Poison was invisible, odorless, and tasteless, capable of causing great terror in the Barbarian Demon Camp, shaking and undermining their morale.<br/>
<br/>
But the wolf pack's attack followed closely, causing the Barbarian Demon Camp to not fully experience the terrifying atmosphere brought by the Formless Poison, instead plunging into the heated emotion of battle.<br/>
<br/>
The Formless Poison was still in effect, but the attention of the Barbarian Demon Camp was drawn by the wolf pack; even if cultivators died mysteriously nearby, most people couldn't care less.<br/>
<br/>
Gu Ya frowned deeply.<br/>
<br/>
His wolf pack crashed into the small Iron Bucket Formation and also suffered head wounds and bleeding; over seventy mountain wolves were killed in a short time.<br/>
<br/>
"Xu Dali's core hasn't been shaken; the influence he brings is taking effect. The cultivators near the core circle are all flocking over. If not stopped, a larger Iron Bucket Formation will soon form!"<br/>
<br/>
"By then, my wolf pack will suffer even more losses."<br/>
<br/>
Gu Ya felt an impulse and looked at Di Lu, wanting to ask him to charge into the formation and coordinate with himself.<br/>
<br/>
But Di Lu, sensing Gu Ya's gaze, decisively shook his head.<br/>
<br/>
Gu Ya's deep affection for his wolves, Di Lu could understand, but Di Lu would not lose the big picture for small gains; his most important task here was to guard Gu Ya.<br/>
<br/>
Di Lu said: "The Hundred Poison Tribe and our Cangyue Tribe have both acted; don't forget, there's also the Ancient Vine Tribe."<br/>
<br/>
With the divine decree's constraints, he was not worried at all that the people of the Ancient Vine Tribe would slack off.<br/>
<br/>
On another mountain peak.<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul cultivator of the Ancient Vine Tribe, Bi Tengyi, and her husband, the Golden Core cultivator Cang Tengwang, both turned their gazes toward the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
On the battlefield, the Barbarian Demon Camp and the wolf pack were slaughtering each other, forming a large area of bloody carnage and shattered corpses.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that Xu Dali's Iron Bucket Formation was expanding, Cang Tengwang took out the huge black bow from his back.<br/>
<br/>
Cang Tengwang stretched out his hand, twisted his own white hair and beard, then pulled forcefully.<br/>
<br/>
The black bow seemed made from dead wood, naturally curved, but without a string.<br/>
<br/>
He broke off his own hair and brought it close to the black bow.<br/>
<br/>
Accompanied by his spellcasting, the white hair in his hand swelled violently, turning into pale vines.<br/>
<br/>
The white vines were thin but tough, with strong elasticity. They automatically clung on, tightly wrapping around the upper and lower ends of the black bow, then tightening themselves, making the black bow bend even more.<br/>
<br/>
Cang Tengwang held the black bow in his left hand, pulled the empty string with his right hand, aiming at the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
He pulled back sharply; with his movement, the muscles in his right arm bulged, emitting a strong masculine aura.<br/>
<br/>
He pulled the bowstring to its limit, then released it.<br/>
<br/>
Bang.<br/>
<br/>
With a muffled sound, the bowstring returned straight, trembling violently.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly without an arrow, yet on the battlefield, where Cang Tengwang's gaze locked, a white streak suddenly appeared.<br/>
<br/>
The white streak solidified instantly, transforming into pale vines, crushing the cultivator's heart, penetrating his body, making vines and thorns sprout from all over his body, turning him into a bloody, broken corpse.<br/>
<br/>
Bang, bang, bang.<br/>
<br/>
Cang Tengwang kept pulling the string and releasing.<br/>
<br/>
His black bow was not a weapon but a magical instrument. Combined with his strange spells, it made vines grow out of thin air inside the cultivators' bodies, taking the lives of one cultivator after another.<br/>
<br/>
Many key figures in the Barbarian Demon Camp died inexplicably.<br/>
<br/>
These people either held formation flags, military orders, or even carried small formation disks.<br/>
<br/>
As these people perished, the expansion momentum of the Barbarian Demon Camp's Iron Bucket Formation suddenly stalled.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this change, Gu Ya laughed heartily and danced the war dance again.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, this was casting spells through body seals.<br/>
<br/>
Beast Control Technique —Wolf Howl Shaking the Heart.<br/>
<br/>
Beast Control Technique —Wolf Claws Like Weapons!<br/>
<br/>
After releasing these two spells, Gu Ya was extremely exhausted, half-kneeling on the spot, panting heavily.<br/>
<br/>
He alone was augmenting the entire wolf pack; even at Nascent Soul level, it was very strenuous. Especially since the wolf pack was already engaging with the Barbarian Demon Camp, affected by their military aura, the difficulty and consumption of spellcasting skyrocketed.<br/>
<br/>
The wolf pack, receiving the augmentation, howled one after another, powerfully shaking the mental defenses of the Barbarian Demon Camp's cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
The wolf claws were covered with a layer of metallic luster, becoming extremely sharp, like weapons.<br/>
<br/>
The wolf pack's offensive increased significantly, killing the Barbarian Demon Camp's cultivators in droves, causing chaos.<br/>
<br/>
"That damn guy controlling the wolf pack must be Gu Ya! I'm going to kill him!" Seeing his side suffering heavy losses, Xu Dali was furious, eyes bloodshot, about to single-handedly seek trouble with Gu Ya.<br/>
<br/>
"General, please don't act rashly."<br/>
<br/>
The deputy general quickly persuaded Xu Dali. Without Xu Dali, the recently stabilized small Iron Bucket Formation would also be in jeopardy.<br/>
<br/>

Author Note:<br/>
<br/>
This part of the plot requires an incredible amount of design. The grand competition of the cultivation era will feature all kinds of techniques playing out in turn, as intricate and dazzling as flowers and stars, showcasing the true brilliance of a flourishing age. In this section, everyone will witness the myriad arts of cultivation, various techniques, and the clashes between different cultivators. With numerous characters involved, the depiction of large-scale cultivation warfare is quite rare. Writing this is extremely challenging, but I will do my utmost to craft it and hope everyone enjoys it. I'll strive to add more chapters tomorrow, but finishing by 8 a.m. is definitely not possible.</div>
