<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 436: The Barbarian Horde's Surprise Attack</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the dense forest halfway up the mountain, Tu Ming revealed himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He stood about seven feet tall, with a robust build and well-defined muscles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">His skin was bronze-colored, clad in animal skins, barefoot, with a large snake coiled around his waist and back. The snake was dead, leaving only its carcass, but it still looked lifelike. The enormous snake head rested above Tu Ming's shoulder, making him appear especially terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">As the High Priest of the Hundred Poison Tribe, known as the Poison Belly, Tu Ming's accessories were mostly snake bones and viper scales, with snake fangs and venom sacs hanging from his necklace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">At this moment, he extended his withered fingers and gently pinched a small venom sac from his necklace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He pulled off the venom sac and infused it with spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In an instant, the venom sac was restored and enlarged to the size of a palm, held by the Poison Belly High Priest in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Tu Ming murmured softly, performed mouth seals, and chanted long incantations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At the same time, his five fingers pressed and kneaded the venom sac continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">His fingers were also bronze-colored, but the wrinkles and gaps between his fingers were pitch-black like iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The kneading and squeezing of his fingers were not without pattern; it was as if five venomous snakes were entwining around the surface of the venom sac, twisting, moving, and stroking damply and coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Tu Ming's lips curled into a sinister smile, his gaze growing colder, emitting a merciless aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Poison Art â€”Formless Poison!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">With mouth seals and finger seals combined, based on the use of the venom sac, he executed this move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Tu Ming was a Nascent Soul-level great cultivator; it had been many years since he had so solemnly and wholeheartedly cast a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The venom sac continued to deplete, gradually collapsing, eventually turning into a thin membrane.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The invisible, odorless, and soundless poisonous gas, guided by Tu Ming's divine sense, drifted silently toward the foot of the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">There, an army was trekking over mountains and through waters, marching swiftly â€”it was the Barbarian Demon Army of the Two Note Kingdom. The poisonous gas drifted into the army without any hindrance, spreading rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The many barbarians and demon cultivators who inhaled the poison continued marching while chatting, laughing and cursing, some even quarreling, without the slightest awareness that death was approaching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Old Ox, how was the taste of that snake demoness?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"What snake demoness? I don't understand what you're talking about!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Don't pretend! Many people saw you sneaking into that female snake demon's tent for dual cultivation late last night. Look at you today, so obviously fatigued from marching â€”are you almost drained dry?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"What are you saying! I, Old Ox, am strong and vigorous; even after seventeen or eighteen rounds of dual cultivation in one night, I would still be full of energy, vigorous as a dragon, spirited as a horse..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Before he could finish his words, the ox-headed demon cultivator fell headfirst to the ground, expressionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The demon cultivator who had just been talking to him reacted by laughing heartily: "Old Ox was boasting too much, he's exhausted himself â€”uh..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He also fell down, face calm, life lost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Thud, thud...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">A series of cultivators collapsed one after another, like stalks of wheat after a storm, falling patch after patch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">At this moment, the Barbarian Demon Camp finally realized something was wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The cultivator responsible for vigilance sounded the alarm bell, shouting loudly: "Enemy attack! Enemy attack!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The next moment, he also died.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But the alarm bell was a magical instrument, still emitting a piercing alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Bad news, General! Someone has poisoned us! We have over a hundred casualties already," a subordinate came to report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Xu Dali, sitting on a heavily armored rhinoceros, was greatly shocked. He quickly reached out, grabbed the long-handled war hammer hanging on his mount, and shouted: "Form ranks! Form ranks!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His voice was loud, stirring up waves of air that spread out. The inner circle of his personal guards understood the situation; the elite soldiers on the outer circle heard the commotion but didn't understand, casting puzzled looks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">A subordinate hurriedly asked: "General, what formation should we arrange?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Iron Bucket Formation! Arrange the Iron Bucket Formation first!" Xu Dali shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The subordinates around him immediately sprang into action; some held military flags, some arranged weapons, some issued orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Barbarian Demon Camp was like a bloated bear, awakened after bleeding and being injured. Its hairs stood on end, and they became vigilantly furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">At another mountainside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Two Nascent Soul-level barbarian cultivators stood side by side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">One was Di Lu, eyes covered with black cloth, upper body bare, painted with blood-red totems, carrying two massive crescent moon scimitars on his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The other was Gu Ya, with blue hair, wolf claw patterns on his cheeks, holding a ferocious wolf-fang mace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Both were of Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Gu Ya stamped hard, plunging the wolf-fang mace into the mountain rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He slightly raised his head, puffed up his chest, took a deep breath, then bit his finger, causing blood to flow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He dipped his finger in blood and smeared it along the wolf claw patterns on his cheeks and forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">At the same time, he activated his spiritual energy, infusing it into the wolf claw patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The patterns, stimulated by both blood and spiritual energy, seemed to come alive, rapidly growing and spreading over Gu Ya's cheeks and chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Eventually, it extended down his legs and spread into the surrounding mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">In no time, the blood-blue patterns formed complex, ancient designs, placing Gu Ya and Di Lu at the very center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Storage Formation â€”Beast Realm: Wolf Mountain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The blood-blue magic formation burst out with intense radiance, from which large packs of wolves charged forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">These ferocious mountain wolves had light gray, dark gray, and even gray-blue fur.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">They were all carefully raised by Gu Ya, possessing considerable strength; the vast majority were at the Qi Refining level, and the leaders were all at the Foundation Establishment level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">There were three Golden Core-level commanders, each as big as a calf. After emerging from the formation, they did not charge but stood beside Gu Ya, guarding the main general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The wolf pack, like a tide, swooped down from the mountainside, forming a ferocious military force, sweeping toward the Barbarian Demon Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Poison Belly High Priest Tu Ming, after performing his poison art, had been watching the Barbarian Demon Camp from afar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Seeing the commotion in the Barbarian Demon Camp, attempting to form a formation, he couldn't help but sneer: "Iron Bucket Formation? Lu Hongtu was right; this Xu Dali lacks talent and doesn't know how to adapt. How can a mere Iron Bucket Formation withstand my Formless Poison?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Elsewhere, Gu Ya also observed the movements of the Barbarian Demon Camp and frowned deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Once the Iron Bucket Battle Formation is formed, it would greatly increase the Barbarian Demon Camp's defense, making it extremely difficult for his wolf pack's assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"If my Cangyue Tribe loses to the Hundred Poison Tribe, where is our face?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"The divine decree requires us to go all out, but if my wolf pack suffers too many losses, how will I face the main forces of the Two Note Kingdom in the future?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Thinking of this, Gu Ya immediately let out a long howl, spread his arms, and began dancing a war dance on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Essentially, this was casting spells through body seals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The blood-blue patterns on his body, with each of his primitive dance movements, left trails of blood-blue light in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The light trails intertwined, weaving into the shape of an altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Gu Ya stepped onto the altar and performed his techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Beast Control Technique â€”Wolfs Run in the Wind!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Wolf Run Technique immediately took effect, greatly increasing the wolf pack's speed, rapidly shortening the charging distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Beast control was one of the many arts of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">In the Thousand Peaks Forest, Gu Ya and Ju Bing were known as the Pig and Wolf Beast Masters; both were well-known for their profound attainments in beast control techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Barbarian Demon Camp fell into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Bad news! The wolf pack has accelerated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"We won't have time to form the formation, General, what should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The subordinates urgently reported.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">In the past few days, Xu Dali had also been diligent; as the main general, he maximized the training volume, but due to the large number of troops, the difficulty of training was very high, and when divided, the level of training was quite low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">At this critical military moment, the Barbarian Demon Camp unsurprisingly fell short, unable to quickly form a formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Form the formation!" Xu Dali shouted loudly, his aura bursting forth, forming a wave of air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The airwave expanded rapidly, sweeping over the entire army within a few breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Military Tactic â€”Speed is of the Essence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">As the main general of an army, Xu Dali naturally also practiced military tactics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He practiced the classic tactic "Speed is of the Essence" quite proficiently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The wolf pack charged even faster; under the blessing of the military tactic, the Barbarian Demon Camp's formation speed also increased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Someone, hold them off for me; we will not retreat in this battle!" Xu Dali roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">His personal guards and elite soldiers around him all quickened their actions; the Iron Bucket Formation with them at the core began to take shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The deputy general filled in Xu Dali's omissions and suggested: "Sir, should we request reinforcements from our allied forces?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Xu Dali was reminded and quickly nodded: "Of course we need reinforcements; quickly request aid!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Awooo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The wolf pack officially clashed with the Barbarian Demon Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The roughly organized front lines of the Barbarian Demon Camp were like tofu dregs, easily torn apart and crushed by the wolf pack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The cultivators of the Barbarian Demon Camp screamed miserably; after the clash, over a hundred were killed or wounded immediately!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The front lines twisted and could not hold, being breached in several places.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The wolf pack, like a flood, rushed through the breaches into the inner circle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">But here, they hit an iron wall, and their offensive was obviously contained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Surrounding Xu Dali, his personal guards and elite soldiers had formed a compact Iron Bucket Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The battle formation gave every participating cultivator a massive defensive boost, making them like copper skin and iron bones; no matter how the mountain wolves bit and tore, it was hard to be effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">On the mountainside, Tu Ming's expression grew somewhat grave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The resilience of the Barbarian Demon Camp was somewhat beyond his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He saw that the core of the Barbarian Demon Camp had stabilized, and although the majority of the cultivators outside the core were retreating step by step, it was only due to the fierce assault of the wolf pack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Few of them were panicking; most were indignant after being attacked, wanting to retaliate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"The morale of the Barbarian Demon Camp is still usable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Gu Ya is too impatient, hindering my plan to disturb their morale."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Tu Ming became dissatisfied with Gu Ya.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">His Formless Poison was invisible, odorless, and tasteless, capable of causing great terror in the Barbarian Demon Camp, shaking and undermining their morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">But the wolf pack's attack followed closely, causing the Barbarian Demon Camp to not fully experience the terrifying atmosphere brought by the Formless Poison, instead plunging into the heated emotion of battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Formless Poison was still in effect, but the attention of the Barbarian Demon Camp was drawn by the wolf pack; even if cultivators died mysteriously nearby, most people couldn't care less.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Gu Ya frowned deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">His wolf pack crashed into the small Iron Bucket Formation and also suffered head wounds and bleeding; over seventy mountain wolves were killed in a short time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Xu Dali's core hasn't been shaken; the influence he brings is taking effect. The cultivators near the core circle are all flocking over. If not stopped, a larger Iron Bucket Formation will soon form!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"By then, my wolf pack will suffer even more losses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Gu Ya felt an impulse and looked at Di Lu, wanting to ask him to charge into the formation and coordinate with himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">But Di Lu, sensing Gu Ya's gaze, decisively shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Gu Ya's deep affection for his wolves, Di Lu could understand, but Di Lu would not lose the big picture for small gains; his most important task here was to guard Gu Ya.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Di Lu said: "The Hundred Poison Tribe and our Cangyue Tribe have both acted; don't forget, there's also the Ancient Vine Tribe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">With the divine decree's constraints, he was not worried at all that the people of the Ancient Vine Tribe would slack off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">On another mountain peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The Nascent Soul cultivator of the Ancient Vine Tribe, Bi Tengyi, and her husband, the Golden Core cultivator Cang Tengwang, both turned their gazes toward the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">On the battlefield, the Barbarian Demon Camp and the wolf pack were slaughtering each other, forming a large area of bloody carnage and shattered corpses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Seeing that Xu Dali's Iron Bucket Formation was expanding, Cang Tengwang took out the huge black bow from his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Cang Tengwang stretched out his hand, twisted his own white hair and beard, then pulled forcefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The black bow seemed made from dead wood, naturally curved, but without a string.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He broke off his own hair and brought it close to the black bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Accompanied by his spellcasting, the white hair in his hand swelled violently, turning into pale vines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The white vines were thin but tough, with strong elasticity. They automatically clung on, tightly wrapping around the upper and lower ends of the black bow, then tightening themselves, making the black bow bend even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Cang Tengwang held the black bow in his left hand, pulled the empty string with his right hand, aiming at the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">He pulled back sharply; with his movement, the muscles in his right arm bulged, emitting a strong masculine aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">He pulled the bowstring to its limit, then released it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">With a muffled sound, the bowstring returned straight, trembling violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Clearly without an arrow, yet on the battlefield, where Cang Tengwang's gaze locked, a white streak suddenly appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The white streak solidified instantly, transforming into pale vines, crushing the cultivator's heart, penetrating his body, making vines and thorns sprout from all over his body, turning him into a bloody, broken corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Bang, bang, bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Cang Tengwang kept pulling the string and releasing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">His black bow was not a weapon but a magical instrument. Combined with his strange spells, it made vines grow out of thin air inside the cultivators' bodies, taking the lives of one cultivator after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Many key figures in the Barbarian Demon Camp died inexplicably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">These people either held formation flags, military orders, or even carried small formation disks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">As these people perished, the expansion momentum of the Barbarian Demon Camp's Iron Bucket Formation suddenly stalled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Seeing this change, Gu Ya laughed heartily and danced the war dance again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Essentially, this was casting spells through body seals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Beast Control Technique â€”Wolf Howl Shaking the Heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Beast Control Technique â€”Wolf Claws Like Weapons!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">After releasing these two spells, Gu Ya was extremely exhausted, half-kneeling on the spot, panting heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">He alone was augmenting the entire wolf pack; even at Nascent Soul level, it was very strenuous. Especially since the wolf pack was already engaging with the Barbarian Demon Camp, affected by their military aura, the difficulty and consumption of spellcasting skyrocketed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The wolf pack, receiving the augmentation, howled one after another, powerfully shaking the mental defenses of the Barbarian Demon Camp's cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The wolf claws were covered with a layer of metallic luster, becoming extremely sharp, like weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">The wolf pack's offensive increased significantly, killing the Barbarian Demon Camp's cultivators in droves, causing chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">"That damn guy controlling the wolf pack must be Gu Ya! I'm going to kill him!" Seeing his side suffering heavy losses, Xu Dali was furious, eyes bloodshot, about to single-handedly seek trouble with Gu Ya.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">"General, please don't act rashly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">The deputy general quickly persuaded Xu Dali. Without Xu Dali, the recently stabilized small Iron Bucket Formation would also be in jeopardy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="310">--------------</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Author Note:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">This part of the plot requires an incredible amount of design. The grand competition of the cultivation era will feature all kinds of techniques playing out in turn, as intricate and dazzling as flowers and stars, showcasing the true brilliance of a flourishing age. In this section, everyone will witness the myriad arts of cultivation, various techniques, and the clashes between different cultivators. With numerous characters involved, the depiction of large-scale cultivation warfare is quite rare. Writing this is extremely challenging, but I will do my utmost to craft it and hope everyone enjoys it. I'll strive to add more chapters tomorrow, but finishing by 8 a.m. is definitely not possible.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
