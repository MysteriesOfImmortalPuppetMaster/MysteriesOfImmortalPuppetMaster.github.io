<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Linghu Jiu laughed heartily: "Haha, yes, I have a bowl, I have a bowl."<br/>
<br/>
He took out another stone bowl, similar in form to the one he was using.<br/>
<br/>
"As long as Young Master Ning Zhuo doesn't mind it being rough and simple..."<br/>
<br/>
Before Linghu Jiu could finish speaking, the stone bowl in his hand was "snatched" away by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Fill it up, fill it up!" Ning Zhuo's eyes sparkled.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu filled the bowl with wine for him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo imitated Linghu Jiu, tilting his head back and gulping it down directly.<br/>
<br/>
He had never drunk so fiercely before.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, he was once again immersed in deep thought, seeing the great ancestor, the Five Elements Divine Lord. The Divine Lord continued to pass on the family's ultimate technique to Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
The Five Viscera Temple Spirit Technique!<br/>
<br/>
This technique was extremely profound, said to concentrate the essence of heaven and earth, harmonizing the wonders of the five elements, deeply embodying the Dao and its principles.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo was young, his vision was broad. Just hearing the introduction, he knew intuitively that this technique was no worse than the Three Sect Supreme Methods!<br/>
<br/>
Even though he had already mastered the Three Sect Supreme Methods, this divine technique would still greatly benefit him. Comparing the two would allow Ning Zhuo to understand the principles of the five elements more deeply.<br/>
<br/>
He also hoped that some of the spells contained in this technique could be improved and used for himself.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo drank one bowl after another.<br/>
<br/>
"More!"<br/>
<br/>
"Still not enough!"<br/>
<br/>
"I need more to drink!"<br/>
<br/>
He had forgotten himself, but a strong premonition in his heart told him that this divine technique would be extremely helpful to him!<br/>
<br/>
Linghu‚Äôs expression changed slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's drinking was even more fierce than before, completely reckless and frenzied.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu looked at the nearly empty wine jar, feeling somewhat helpless, and couldn't help but ask himself.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu was moved: "I've only encountered a situation like yours once. After that time, my sword skills greatly improved, completely transforming me!"<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo, this is your destined opportunity."<br/>
<br/>
Linghu poured the wine, completely emptying the jar, but it only filled half a bowl.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was full of regret: "There's still half left, half of the divine technique left!"<br/>
<br/>
Linghu laughed: "Don't worry, Young Master Ning Zhuo, I will do my utmost to help you, not letting you stop halfway!"<br/>
<br/>
With that, he took out another jar of Profound Thought Brew.<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you!!" Ning Zhuo bowed to him in gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu could have easily made excuses, saying he only had one jar of Profound Thought Brew. But he didn't do that, instead taking out a second jar.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that this was only their first meeting, and they had even had conflicts before. For Linghu to offer such great assistance at this crucial moment was truly rare and precious!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo silently remembered this kindness in his heart and continued to drink heavily.<br/>
<br/>
He drank until his cheeks flushed, feeling a slight dizziness that was truly wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
He drank until his face was bright red, feeling as if he was about to ascend to immortality.<br/>
<br/>
He drank until his ears were red, his heart pounding, his whole body burning hot.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, he drank until the world was spinning, his eyes blurry, almost about to collapse.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo held onto his last bit of clarity, his eyes bloodshot, gritting his teeth: "More!"<br/>
<br/>
"Just a little more, just a little bit left."<br/>
<br/>
Linghu looked at him with concern, thinking that even he felt a bit frightened by such fierce drinking.<br/>
<br/>
"Could Ning Zhuo be risking his life drinking here?"<br/>
<br/>
"If something were to happen to him, how would my little junior sister view me?"<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of this, Linghu felt a twinge of jealousy, his emotions complex and unclear.<br/>
<br/>
But at this point, Linghu could only grit his teeth and see it through to the end. If they were to interrupt this great opportunity now, there was a possibility of them becoming enemies.<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo, hang in there!" Linghu cheered him on.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was also closely monitoring Ning Zhuo's condition, ready to intervene immediately if anything went wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Gulp, gulp.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's throat bobbed as he swallowed another large bowl of the Meditative Thought Brew.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, on the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
In her chambers, Lin Shanshan paced back and forth, her face full of anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
"What should I do? What should I do?"<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo and Senior Brother have met. They had a misunderstanding before, and although Senior Brother sent out the Two Enlightenment Diagrams, Ning Zhuo didn't accept it."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo even said he wanted to handle this problem in his own way."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm afraid that this time he actively requested my father to visit my Senior Brother, to settle scores!"<br/>
<br/>
"Xiao Ju, do you think they might fight?"<br/>
<br/>
Her personal maid said, "Miss, I don't think it will come to that. Although I've rarely met Young Master Ning Zhuo, I feel he's a gentle and refined person."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan shook her head: "Xiao Ju, you haven't sparred or trained with Young Master Ning Zhuo. He's very tough and strong-willed at his core. Every special training session, he only rests when he's reached his physical limit. You don't understand him!"<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju: "Oh my, Miss, stop pacing! You're making me dizzy!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan suddenly turned and quickly walked to the door, about to push it open and leave.<br/>
<br/>
"Miss!" Xiao Ju hurried over to block her, "Miss, have you forgotten? You've been grounded!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan said: "Xiao Ju, desperate times call for desperate measures. If we delay any longer, the situation might become very bad."<br/>
<br/>
Saying this, she ignored Xiao Ju's obstruction and pushed the door open.<br/>
<br/>
The female attendants on both sides immediately blocked her: "Young Miss, please stay."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan raised her arm and said sternly: "Get out of my way! I'd like to see who dares to stop me?!"<br/>
<br/>
The female attendants were immediately at a loss, very troubled, and they all knelt down.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan snorted coldly, stepped over the threshold, and walked into the courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
"Stop." A voice came from behind.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan immediately froze in place as if hit by a spell.<br/>
<br/>
She slowly turned to look in the direction of the voice, and sure enough, saw Lin Bufan: "Father."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan lowered her head, looking extremely obedient.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan waved his hand, dismissing everyone else, leaving only the father and daughter in the courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan walked in the courtyard, with Lin Shanshan following closely at his side.<br/>
<br/>
He glanced at his beloved daughter and said: "Are you lacking confidence in the Ning family's boy, or in your senior brother?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan was stunned for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
She immediately understood the meaning behind his words and looked up at Lin Bufan: "Father, is this your plan?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan shook his head slightly: "Not exactly. This was Ning Zhuo's personal request to me. Coincidentally, I also wanted to see his mettle, so I went along with it and facilitated this situation."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan anxiously said: "Father, but Young Master Ning Zhuo is only sixteen years old, I'm five years older than him, let alone Senior Brother."<br/>
<br/>
"He's so young, how can he be a match for Senior Brother? If we bully an outsider like this, won't it spread and make our Myriad Medicine Sect look bad?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan glanced at his beloved daughter again, his tone indifferent: "You're quite considerate of outsiders, I've never seen you like this before."<br/>
<br/>
"You're underestimating Ning Zhuo. He's not simple!"<br/>
<br/>
Saying this, Lin Bufan took out a jade slip and handed it to Lin Shanshan.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan infused her divine sense to check it, and found that the contents of this jade slip were the intelligence results from the sixth senior brother's field investigation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan quickly browsed through it, her eyes gradually widening.<br/>
<br/>
Very different from what she had expected, Ning Zhuo was not valued and cultivated by his family from a young age. Instead, from childhood to adulthood, he had suffered exclusion and harsh treatment from his family.<br/>
<br/>
Even just a few months ago, he had been targeted by the then young clan leader of the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after, he directly led his group and launched a counterattack, pulling the young clan leader off his horse.<br/>
<br/>
For over a decade, Ning Zhuo had remained inconspicuous and unremarkable.<br/>
<br/>
But with the emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace, he suddenly exploded onto the scene, making a tremendous impact after staying quiet for so long.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did he control the black market for a period of time, maneuvering between various forces in the city, but he also performed exceptionally well in the Magma Immortal Palace. This led to his successful separation from the main Ning family branch, allowing him to establish his own family business at a young age!<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family branch directly occupied the entire Zheng family's clan territory, with territorial specifications far exceeding those of the Ning family's main branch. On the day of the branch establishment ceremony, Ning Zhuo held a grand banquet. Two Golden Core cultivators, Fei Si from the City Lord's mansion and Zhou Nongying from the Zhou family, personally attended. There was also Zhu Hou from the orphanage, an envoy from the Southern Bean Royal Family.<br/>
<br/>
That day, a Golden Core cultivator from the Cloud Merchants, Song Fuli tried to block the door, intending to embarrass Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, he was persuaded to retreat by three consecutive flying messages! Ning Zhuo didn't even show his face.<br/>
<br/>
What does this indicate?<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan was just inexperienced and naive, but that doesn't mean she lacked insight and ability. On the contrary, she had been carefully nurtured by Lin Bufan since childhood, naturally viewing things from the perspective of a person in a high position. Lin Shanshan was shocked, fully aware of what these achievements meant.<br/>
<br/>
It meant that Ning Zhuo was far from being as simple as he appeared on the surface. He was deeply scheming and skilled in manipulation! He must have hidden himself for many years, disguising himself until the emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace, when he saw an opportunity and suddenly rose to prominence.<br/>
<br/>
Was his talent only revealed when practicing the Three Sects Methods? Hadn't he known for over a decade?<br/>
This was indeed possible.<br/>
But look at what Ning Zhuo did when various parties were competing for the Lava Immortal Palace. He overthrew the young clan leader, controlled the black market, and made rapid progress by leveraging the resources of the three-family alliance. In the end, he even got the Ning family's Golden Core ancestor to acquiesce to his branch separation!<br/>
<br/>
Could all these events be accomplished by a pure and naive youth?<br/>
<br/>
No, of course not.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, combining this with his display of talent, Lin Shanshan speculated that this was just Ning Zhuo revealing appropriate talent at the right time!<br/>
Lin Shanshan also saw intelligence about Jade Steel Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo had been to Cloud Concealment Mountain, and Jade Steel Mountain is near Cloud Concealment Mountain. I accepted the Misty Elegant Orchid he gifted and specifically checked the map."<br/>
"The Ning family branch's Jade Moistening Mystic Steel business has only been operating for a short time, coinciding with Young Master Ning Zhuo's time at Cloud Concealment Mountain."<br/>
<br/>
"This should be the result of his efforts."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, he came to the Myriad Medicine Sect seeking an alliance, which is probably a similar cooperation."<br/>
<br/>
"He really is... quite remarkable!"<br/>
<br/>
For the first time, Lin Shanshan felt admiration for a peer, or more accurately, a young man five years younger than her.<br/>
<br/>
She rubbed the jade slip in her hand, thinking more and more about how truly remarkable Ning Zhuo was.<br/>
<br/>
From a young age, he endured harsh treatment and neglect, but instead of accepting his fate, he secretly accumulated strength, enduring silently and deceiving all his enemies.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace was just an east wind, an opportunity Ning Zhuo had been patiently waiting for over a decade.<br/>
<br/>
Many people in Fire Persimmon Immortal City said that the Lava Immortal Palace made Ning Zhuo successful. But Lin Shanshan felt that with Ning Zhuo's talents, he just needed one opportunity. If not the Lava Immortal Palace, there would have been other chances.<br/>
<br/>
"Someone like him, unless he goes his entire life without encountering an opportunity. But as long as he encounters one chance, he will firmly grasp it, soaring upwards and turning his life around!"<br/>
Seeing Lin Shanshan silent for a long time, Lin Bufan smiled and said, "Shanshan, now you should understand, right? Ning Zhuo has hidden many things from you. Don't be fooled by his young appearance."<br/>
<br/>
"He is a person with extreme scheming abilities, hiding very deeply. There are many things he hasn't told you, right?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan nodded: "Yes, indeed, he never mentioned that he was the patriarch of a branch family."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh! That's just like him, being overly modest."<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest, if this wasn't the result of Sixth Senior Brother's personal investigation, I would find it hard to imagine that a 16-year-old peer could achieve such accomplishments."<br/>
<br/>
"Compared to him, I feel like I've wasted my time and am useless."<br/>
<br/>
A trace of scheming flashed across Lin Bufan's face: "You care so deeply for Ning Zhuo, even getting yourself confined to help him. Aren't you angry that he wasn't honest with you?"<br/>
Lin Shanshan immediately gave Lin Bufan a look: "Father, what are you saying!"<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master Ning didn't intentionally hide anything from me. He just didn't mention these things."<br/>
<br/>
"Given his low-key and steady personality, if he were to boast about his past achievements to me, I wouldn't even want to listen."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan suddenly revealed a smile and said, "Actually, Ning Zhuo is very much like you, Father, isn't he?"<br/>
<br/>
"In your early years, although you were at the Golden Core stage, you were very ordinary. At that time, many elders in the Myriad Medicine Sect looked down on you, thinking that 'Lin Fan' (Ordinary Lin) would be a more fitting name for you."<br/>
<br/>
"But those were just your disguises. Suddenly one day, you broke through and advanced to the Nascent Soul stage. Only then did the world realize in shock that you had been hiding your Golden Core Peak cultivation for so many years."<br/>
<br/>
"After achieving Nascent Soul, you immediately swept away all competitors and quickly grasped all the power in the Myriad Medicine Sect. To avoid old forces and long-standing political issues, you directly negotiated with the mountain god alone, moving Origin Mountain to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, thoroughly clearing the influence of old forces. From then on, you started with a clean slate, implementing grand plans, managing the Myriad Medicine Sect to prosperity, thriving day by day."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, throughout the entire Myriad Medicine Sect, there is only one voice, and that is your voice, Father. There is only one will, and that is your will!"<br/>
Lin Bufan stroked his beard, smiling without speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan continued: "Isn't the current Ning Zhuo just like you were back then, Father? It's just that you were even more patient, waiting until the Nascent Soul stage before truly taking action and displaying your abilities."<br/>
"Young Master Ning Zhuo is not as patient as you in this aspect. He couldn't hold back at the Foundation Establishment stage and already revealed his sharp edge."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan shook his head: "It was at the Qi Refining stage. When he was in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he was still at the Qi Refining stage. Advancing to the Foundation Establishment stage only happened recently."<br/>
"Hearing you say this, I think I understand where your fondness for Ning Zhuo comes from."<br/>
<br/>
"You little girl, your skill in persuading people has indeed improved day by day!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled, no longer feeling as nervous as before.<br/>
<br/>
Her previous nervousness was due to not knowing Ning Zhuo's achievements. Now that she had seen the intelligence reports, she understood Ning Zhuo better.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan was worried that Ning Zhuo, being young and impetuous, might cause conflicts with the eldest senior brother. But now she realized, how could such a cunning fox do such a foolish thing?<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan had been overly concerned, losing her composure, but now that she had calmed down, her rationality allowed her to see the current situation more clearly.<br/>
<br/>
She said: "In that case, this meeting between Young Master Ning Zhuo and eldest senior brother is actually quite significant, relating to the long-term relationship between our sect and the Ning family of Fire Persimmon."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan nodded: "Correct. In the future, the one who can inherit my mantle and succeed as the sect leader can only be your eldest senior brother."<br/>
<br/>
"Although 'Drunken Moon Chasing Immortal' is only rated as having superior talent, it's just that good wine is hard to find and too expensive to use. Now, with your eldest senior brother paired with the Profound Meditative Brew, it's simply a match made in heaven."<br/>
<br/>
"It's just that his temperament is too lazy and he places too much importance on the feelings between fellow disciples. How many times have junior brothers violated sect rules, and he took responsibility for them? Do you think I don't know?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, in this regard, I'd rather he learn more from that kid Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"The reason I often punish your senior brother with solitary confinement is that I hope he can overcome his lazy nature and gain insight into himself in solitude. He should be less lenient with others and think more about himself. Otherwise, he'll eventually be dragged down by you juniors!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan protested: "Objection! Senior brother grew up with us, and we've had a sibling-like bond since childhood. In the past, didn't you often praise him as a model big brother?"<br/>
<br/>
"Isn't senior brother the way he is because of your teachings?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan shook his head: "I often reflect on this matter. You're right to object. Although I've held the position of sect leader for many years, being a parent is still new to me. So despite living for hundreds of years, I still lack experience in this area."<br/>
<br/>
"As they say, it takes ten years to grow trees but a hundred years to cultivate people. Sigh! Being a parent and educating the next generation is no easy task. It's much harder than leading a sect."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan spoke with feeling.<br/>
<br/>
He was now communicating with Lin Shanshan out of concern for his daughter, worried that she might be deceived by love and used by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan and Ning Zhuo had only met recently, yet she was already helping him so much. She was accumulating debts and even neglecting her daily cultivation practices.<br/>
<br/>
This was simply outrageous!<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan had been holding back his thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Two days ago, when he first met Ning Zhuo and received intelligence about him, he realized why Lin Shanshan had fallen for him.<br/>
<br/>
Today, he came to talk with Lin Shanshan specifically to probe his daughter's views and attitude.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly realized that part of the reason his daughter was fond of Ning Zhuo was because Ning Zhuo was so similar to himself!<br/>
<br/>
"Indeed."<br/>
<br/>
"Compared to Jiu'er and me, there are indeed significant differences in temperament."<br/>
<br/>
"That kid Ning Zhuo is indeed similar to me, very similar to me!"<br/>
<br/>
Thinking this way, Lin Bufan's hidden hostility towards Ning Zhuo dissipated quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan suddenly understood much more about Lin Shanshan's dedication.<br/>
<br/>
"Now, do you still want to go out and interfere with your senior brother's meeting with Ning Zhuo?" he asked his daughter casually.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan shook her head: "No, I won't go. Going would only cause them trouble. I trust senior brother, and I trust Young Master Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan nodded: "That's good. Go back to your room then."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan bowed immediately: "Father, your daughter takes her leave."<br/>
<br/>
However, after returning to her room, Lin Shanshan instructed her personal maid Xiao Ju: "Young Master Ning Zhuo's meeting with senior brother is of great importance, concerning the long-term alliance between our sect and the Ning family."<br/>
<br/>
"My father wants to use this to test Young Master Ning Zhuo, and also to test senior brother."<br/>
<br/>
"As senior brother's junior and Young Master Ning Zhuo's friend here, I naturally need to help."<br/>
<br/>
"I can't go out by myself, so Xiao Ju, you go on my behalf. If they get into a conflict, make sure to stop them. What I'm worried about now is that Young Master Ning Zhuo only intended to have a friendly spar, but as they fight, things might get heated with senior brother."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, although he's steady and low-key, he still has a youthful temperament. At such a young age, he's already made a name for himself. The pride in his heart is not reflected in his outwardly gentle appearance."<br/>
<br/>
"I know this all too well, my father is just like that!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan spoke with feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan appeared completely peaceful and gentle on the surface. But having been by his side for twenty-one years, Lin Shanshan had witnessed his truly angry moments, the ruthless cruelty behind his smiling punishment of enemies.<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, Miss, I'll go," Xiao Ju wouldn't disobey; she was very loyal to Lin Shanshan.<br/>
<br/>
"Xiao Ju, I'm counting on you!" Lin Shanshan said.<br/>
<br/>
Xiao Ju hurriedly left.<br/>
<br/>
Little did they know that any movement in the small courtyard was under Lin Bufan's spiritual sense.<br/>
<br/>
Watching Xiao Ju head straight towards Da Zheng Peak, Lin Bufan sighed quietly in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
"My daughter has indeed grown up and has her own ideas. In the past, she wouldn't have made these small moves."<br/>
<br/>
But this old father didn't stop Xiao Ju.<br/>
<br/>
He cast his gaze towards Ten Thousand Beast Cave, full of expectation.<br/>
<br/>
Children have their own lives to live.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan had a child and accepted disciples late in life. He planned for the long term, carefully selecting disciples back then, scheming for future situations.<br/>
<br/>
After decades, results were showing.<br/>
<br/>
"Given time, when Jiu'er achieves the Golden Core, I'll be able to step down as sect leader and focus entirely on closed-door cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
At the Golden Core and Nascent Soul levels of cultivation, even daily practice consumed enormous resources.<br/>
<br/>
So, Lin Bufan's painstaking efforts to establish the Myriad Medicine Sect were also for his own cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the Myriad Medicine Sect was stable, and the next generation's leader had been personally trained by him. Linghu Jiu's talent was sufficient, and his nature was very kind-hearted, which was actually the result of Lin Bufan's careful nurturing.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan was deeply versed in the art of cultivation, well aware of the dangers of pushing growth too quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, in his daily teachings to his daughter and disciples, he influenced them subtly and imperceptibly. Unless it involved principles or bottom lines, he rarely disciplined them severely.<br/>
<br/>
This time, although he was concerned about his beloved daughter, he didn't stop her actions.<br/>
<br/>
"Female cultivators are indeed easily blinded by love."<br/>
<br/>
"That kid Ning Zhuo is not easy to deal with. My daughter's cultivation is far too shallow, if she's not careful, she'll be eaten alive."<br/>
<br/>
"Jiu'er should be more reliable than Shanshan!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan extended his spiritual sense towards Ten Thousand Beast Cave.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he saw the scene of Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu together.<br/>
<br/>
He... fell into a long silence.<br/>
