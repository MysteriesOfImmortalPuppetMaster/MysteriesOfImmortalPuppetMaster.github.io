<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The statue of the Wutu Suppression Prison True Lord showed an unusual movement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This statue was naturally forged by Ning Zhuo after he utilized the Zhu Clan’s Divine Summoning Art to invite the deity. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In the next moment, divine light surged, landing upon Ning Zhuo. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The light carried a stream of information, which Ning Zhuo received in its entirety. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"The third Cloud-Rising Trial for Confucian cultivators?" Ning Zhuo’s brows twitched slightly in surprise. This news came from Zhu Fenxiang, transmitted through her own statue - essentially using the Wutu Suppression Prison True Lord as a relay station.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"So that's how it is."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Zhu Guizhi and Zhao Hansheng have already reached a private agreement. That is why there is a plan for Zhu Fenxiang to participate in the Confucian trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo immediately gained a direct understanding of the cause and effect. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zhu Fenxiang’s stance was primarily influenced by the Wutu Suppression Prison True Lord. Therefore, upon learning of this matter, she immediately used the statue as a relay to deliver this precious intelligence into Ning Zhuo’s hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Just as Ning Zhuo was about to study it, a flying message from Wen Ruanyu arrived. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">It turned out that Chu Xuangui had once again informed Wen Ruanyu via flying message about the Confucian community's discussions regarding Qin De. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">After Wen Ruanyu learned of this, he felt that Ning Zhuo should be made aware, so he transcribed a large portion and sent it to him. He did not offer his own views in the letter, only stating the facts, which carried a hidden intent to test Ning Zhuo. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Sigh... Qin De is indeed the greatest obstacle to the development of the Confucian community." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"The Confucian cultivators originally designed this third Cloud-Rising Trial based on my needs." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"But with the interference of Gu Qing and Zhao Hansheng, the scale of this trial has expanded, deviating greatly from its original direction. I am no longer the primary focus of the Confucian group." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Previously, Ning Zhuo had intentionally purchased a large number of Confucian techniques at the Commerce Hall to subtly inform the Confucian community of what he needed. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">However, Ning Zhuo was actually considering whether he should give up on this trial. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">According to the content of this trial, Gu Qing’s advantage was too great. There was no need for Ning Zhuo to lose time, energy, and - most importantly - reputation just for the sake of crafting a few sheets of spirit paper. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">If he lost to Gu Qing, it would allow the latter to reclaim a victory, significantly weakening the influence of his previous achievements in the Martial Arts Hall. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Mountains and Rivers Page, Starry Sky Paper, Haoran Xuan, Heartfire Silk, and the Dao-Bearing Jade Page?!" As Ning Zhuo reviewed the intelligence sent by Zhu Fenxiang, his previous thoughts of withdrawing were thrown to the back of his mind. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The first four were all types of spirit paper that were widely used and held great market value. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Learning the methods to refine them was a path to profit in itself. He was certain that the number of cultivators participating in the trial would be explosive! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Chu Xuangui and Song Taosheng had indeed gone to great lengths for this trial, creating a truly massive momentum and scale. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"The key is the Dao-Bearing Jade Page; it can actually carry True Intent!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Can Zhao Hansheng really produce it?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"To participate in this trial, he has truly spared no effort and is willing to pay a heavy price." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo was very clear on the weight of a Dao-Bearing Jade Page! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Spirit paper capable of carrying True Intent was extremely rare. Every refining method was a closely guarded secret, treated as a foundational, supreme treasure of any power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">For instance, the Ning Clan did not possess one. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Thus, the Ning Clan’s foundations were the Proud Snow Map and the Frost-Defying Map. These types of papers only carried a certain type of Sentiment. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Comprehending True Intent had no threshold and was 100% successful. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Comprehending Sentiment was different; if the hearts did not align, a cultivator facing a Comprehension Map could only stare blankly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">With True Intent spirit paper, one could create a True Intent Map. No matter a cultivator’s innate comprehension - even if they were a fool - they could understand it at a glance, receive the infusion of True Intent, and immediately see their realm soar. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"If I had the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, I could infuse my own True Intent into it and then pass it on to Big Brother." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Similarly, Sun Lingtong could do the same to provide feedback to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Although True Intent would be depleted and might even lead to a drop in realm, a cultivator could make up for it through future bitter cultivation. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"I have a massive amount of experience and memory, and I won't lose myself." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"After a period of bitter cultivation and sufficient review, I should be able to restore my realm." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Perhaps, just perhaps..." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"I could even directly pass True Intent to my mechanical puppets?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Several of the Golden Core-level puppets in Ning Zhuo’s hands possessed spirituality. This spirituality wasn't yet enough for them to learn spells on their own, but would True Intent absorption work? </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">If the absorption of True Intent succeeded, they would become veterans; it might even be possible for them to comprehend or even create their own spells. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel his heart throb with excitement. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He had to go to this Rising Cloud Trial! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The opportunity for a Dao-Bearing Jade Page was exceptionally rare. Once this chance passed, it might never come again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Of course, since Zhao Hansheng brought it out, he must have the confidence and certainty that others cannot learn it. However, as his student, Gu Qing has likely already mastered it." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Thus, he is using this trial to guarantee Gu Qing becomes number one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Even if others see through this, for the sake of the Dao-Bearing Jade Page, they will turn a blind eye and acquiesce."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo had already seen through Zhao Hansheng’s scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He also anticipated the difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Even so, he was willing to try.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="103"/>
<paragraph index="104">The Third Rising Cloud Trial!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Just as Ning Zhuo expected, the mountain workshop was nearly a sea of people. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">A large number of cultivators had gathered here, eager to participate in the trial. In contrast, the Confucian cultivators appeared small in number, primarily because their population was naturally limited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">Lu Zai served as the trial examiner and presided over the event.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Under everyone's gaze, he slowly took the stage. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">This man had the appearance of a middle-aged male; his stature was not tall, but he was exceptionally sturdy and steady. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">His face was broad and kind, his skin a healthy wheat color as if nourished by Earth Qi year-round. His hands were large and warm, his knuckles distinct, and his palm lines resembled the contours of mountains and rivers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Today, he wore a suit of ochre-yellow Confucian robes made of cotton and linen, which felt heavy to the touch. Simple fretwork was embroidered on the corners and sleeves of the robe, giving a sense of endless continuity and stability. A dark, wide belt was tied around his waist, upon which a jade slip titled the Yu Gong Geographical Map was tucked. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Lu Zai’s voice was steady as he first briefly introduced the rules of this trial and then announced its commencement. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">Everyone filed into the designated doorways. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Upon entering, they stepped into a Formation Space. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">The Confucian cultivators had long anticipated such a flow of people, so they had made preparations, arranging formations to create a massive plaza.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Every set distance on the plaza, there was a stall. Each stall was equipped with the same refining tools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">There were over a thousand stalls in the entire plaza. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Even on such a scale, it wasn't enough. A large number of cultivators were still lining up outside the doors. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Following the flow of people, Ning Zhuo entered the formation and randomly chose a stall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Lu Zai floated in mid-air and began his lecture: "Paper is the mountains and rivers; the heart is the creation. Today's trial is to refine the Mountains and Rivers Page."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">"Earth is the bone, and water is the vessels. Bones without vessels wither; vessels without bones scatter..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">He truly had no nonsense; he started lecturing immediately, explaining the refining method for the Mountains and Rivers Page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">The listeners had varied expressions. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Some were joyful, some frowned, some were confused, and some had sudden realizations... </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Lu Zai did not just explain it once; he explained it three times in succession. He even allowed cultivators to engrave the information into jade slips. He truly held nothing back, sincerely wanting to spread this papermaking technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Ning Zhuo understood it clearly after hearing it once. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">Once Lu Zai finished his explanation, he personally demonstrated the process, quickly producing a Mountains and Rivers Page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">"For us Confucian cultivators, the Literary Palace is wisdom, Literary Qi is power, and the Literary Heart is the root."  Lu Zai’s gaze swept across the field. "Today, I will use my own Literary Heart as a guide to help you sense the earth veins; I will use my Literary Qi as a supplement to help you harmonize the spiritual materials."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">After saying this, he slowly rose and landed in the core of the formation. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Then, he activated his cultivation, continuously gushing out Literary Qi. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">With Lu Zai’s command, the trial began. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Gu Qing, situated in the first row, immediately began his work. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">First, he had to gather materials. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">The stall was equipped with various materials, with Earth Element as the primary ingredient, Water Element as the secondary, and Wood Element as the third. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">The Earth primary ingredients included the Royal Soil from the dynasty’s ancestral temple, Frontier Soil from the border passes, Mountain Essence from famous peaks, and Shrine Soil from villages. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">The Water auxiliary materials were mainly Stalactites from underground caves. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">The Wood auxiliary materials were various types of Wood Pith. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Gu Qing discarded the Royal Soil and Frontier Soil, taking a piece of Mountain Essence and holding it in his hand. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">His divine sense moved, surrounding the Mountain Essence as he performed the Confucian technique - Investigation of Things! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Very quickly, within his Literary Palace in his divine sea, information about the Mountain Essence was continuously generated, converging together to form a phantom of the Mountain Essence. Its appearance was no different from the Mountain Essence in reality. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Gu Qing followed the same pattern, taking a section of Stalactite and performing the Investigation of Things. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">In the Literary Palace, the phantom of the Stalactite appeared again. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Gu Qing’s divine sense shifted, and from a massive bookshelf in the Literary Palace, an essay immediately flew out. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">The content of the essay was exactly the refining method for the Mountains and Rivers Page that Lu Zai had spoken of earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Countless characters emitted a faint light, gathering into a vortex that spun continuously before spreading out and turning into a mass of gray-white halo. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">The phantoms of the Mountain Essence and Stalactite were sucked into the halo, merging with each other to form the phantom of a sheet of paper. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">However, the form of the paper was unstable, sometimes shrinking into a ball, sometimes spreading out into a foot-long sheet, and sometimes twisting into a spiral... </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Gu Qing’s divine sense was continuously consumed, but he quickly made a precise judgment. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">He took a second piece of Mountain Essence and performed the Investigation of Things. As the phantom merged into the halo, the form of the paper immediately stabilized significantly, though the corners remained blurry and wrinkles occasionally appeared on the surface. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Gu Qing’s divine sense continued to be consumed, and he made another accurate judgment. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">This time, he chose a suitable Wood Pith. The addition of the Wood Pith phantom completely stabilized the paper phantom. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">Gu Qing could have done even better, making the paper phantom lifelike and even emitting a jade-like glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">"This Confucian trial’s evaluation criteria include both quality and quantity.  Furthermore, in all five stages, the ratio of quality to quantity is different for each. In this stage, I will prioritize quantity and then seek quality; this is the most secure approach." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">After finishing his calculations, Gu Qing immediately set to work and began the refining process. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">He first used a fire-refining method to melt the Mountain Essence and Stalactite, then used a water-refining method to dissolve the Wood Pith, finally bringing the three together in a Dissolving Basin. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">A Dissolving Basin was a water-refining vessel, the counterpart to a furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Next, Gu Qing continuously channeled his own spiritual energy and Literary Qi into the Dissolving Basin. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">When the timing was right, he permeated his divine sense and activated the refining essay within his Literary Palace. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">The mingled substances in the basin finally mixed into a blue-brown paper pulp. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">"It’s time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">He shouted inwardly: "Rise!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">The pulp was pulled out of the basin, rising into the air. Gu Qing activated the Literary Heart in his Lower Dantian and spat out a stream of vital essence, hitting the pulp. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">The pulp, which had been clumped together, suddenly unfurled after being hit by the vital essence, forming a sheet the size of a fingernail. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">The pulp quickly hardened, its surface uneven, resembling a miniature landscape of mountains and rivers. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Gu Qing’s mind focused on it; after three breaths, he immediately acted, his fingers flying as he pinched the correct finger seals. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Consequently, the thick paper was directly sliced apart, turning into over twenty sheets. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">The several sheets on the top and bottom layers were uneven and coarse, making them impossible to write upon, so they were discarded. However, the central layers and the sheets near them had flat surfaces and a delicate texture - these were qualified spirit paper! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">After checking them once, Gu Qing placed the qualified spirit paper to the side and continued with a second wave of refining. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">"Brother Gu’s Confucian technique attainments are so strong!" Not far away, Bai Jiyun, who was at another stall, witnessed Gu Qing being the first to complete the papermaking and couldn't help but feel a shock in his heart. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">The Confucian technique Investigation of Things best reflected a Confucian cultivator's attainment. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Having finished his first wave of refining, Gu Qing immediately started the second. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">At this time, Bai Jiyun was still investigating the properties and details of the various precious materials. His speed could not even be compared to Gu Qing’s.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">Bai Jiyun used his divine sense to scan Liu Fushu and saw that he had already begun processing the materials, causing him to give a bitter smile. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Liu Fushu’s cultivation was even weaker than Bai Jiyun’s, but his basic skills were solid; at the very least, his execution of the Investigation of Things was much stronger than Bai Jiyun’s. Therefore, Liu Fushu’s progress was slightly ahead of Bai Jiyun’s. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">Bai Jiyun usually preferred poetry and did not care much for Confucian techniques like the Investigation of Things. He practiced them very little and was now suffering the consequences. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Ning Zhuo was located in the middle-to-rear section. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">He handled the materials one by one, his divine sense covering or permeating these precious materials as he also investigated their properties. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">However, unlike Bai Jiyun, he concluded this process after only a few breaths. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">These materials were primarily of the Earth and Water elements. Ning Zhuo had a very deep realm in the Five Elements, so the speed at which he understood them was quite rapid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">He then began processing the materials. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">This process also went smoothly. The properties exhibited by the materials did not exceed the scope of his understanding. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">Ning Zhuo’s realm in Artifact Refining had also recently been elevated. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">However, he slowed down in terms of speed, faring much worse than Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and others. He simply could not compare with Gu Qing. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">"There's no way around it. The papermaking method Lu Zai taught involves Confucian resources; the Literary Heart, Literary Qi, and Literary Palace are all participating." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">"I don't have these, so I can only borrow them." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">The stall provided a continuous stream of Literary Qi, and thanks to the formation, its size could be adjusted. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">A Literary Palace could not be provided, but the effects of a Literary Heart could be simply substituted by a cultivator spitting out their own vital essence blood. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">Of course, the assistance it provided to papermaking was naturally inferior to a true Literary Heart. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">By the time Ning Zhuo refined his first wave of Mountains and Rivers Pages, Liu Fushu had just finished his second. Gu Qing’s progress was already on the fifth wave. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">Meanwhile, the majority of cultivators were still checking their materials or processing them. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">Clang, clang, clang... </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">A bell rang, reminding all the cultivators present that half the time had already passed. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">Ning Zhuo performed a rough observation with his divine sense and found that he was only in an above-average position. Among the leading cultivators, such as Gu Qing, the number of sheets produced was already double his own. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">The big-headed youth shook his head inwardly, a bitter smile in his heart: "Confucian cultivators have too great an advantage in papermaking. Whether it's the Literary Heart, Palace, or Qi, it is most convenient when using one's own." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="286">"And that's not even counting the fact that these Confucian cultivators have, more or less, refined these spirit papers before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="288">"Especially Gu Qing." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="290">"Since Zhao Hansheng could leak information to Zhu Fenxiang, Gu Qing has likely practiced many extra sessions before the trial." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="292">"He came prepared." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="294">In contrast, many cultivators, including Ning Zhuo, were hearing the refining method for the Mountains and Rivers Page for the very first time. This pre-existing gap led to a massive difference between the upper and lower levels of performance in the papermaking field. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="296">"If I can't compete in quantity, can I find a way through quality?" Ning Zhuo pondered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="298">Elsewhere, Kong Ran had already achieved results. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="300">The number of sheets he produced was also limited, mainly because his cultivation was only at the Qi Refining Stage.  However, the quality of the paper he produced was very high. The reason was simple: in the final process, he added Official Qi to the paper. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="302">His father was a high-ranking official of the Flying Cloud Kingdom. As his biological son, it was a simple matter for Kong Ran to borrow some Official Qi. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="304">The Official Qi caused the quality of the Mountains and Rivers Page to rise by at least one grade. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="306">Gu Qing observed his surroundings with his divine sense and felt at ease. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="308">Although he had no Official Qi to use, using the precious Royal Soil and Frontier Soil could also greatly enhance the quality of the Mountains and Rivers Page. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="310">"In this round, I shall be number one!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="312">"Hmph, this Ning Zhuo actually showed up." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="314">"That's fine. Defeating him easily and leaving a clear gap will greatly offset the influence of his previous plot against me." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="316">Just as he was thinking this, he observed Ning Zhuo’s expression change slightly through his divine sense. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="318">Immediately after, with a look of doubt, Ning Zhuo took out a jade pendant from his storage belt. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="320">Roar - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="322">A dragon’s cry echoed throughout the venue. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="324">Then, a dragon shadow emerged from the jade pendant and dove into the Mountains and Rivers Page. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="326">In the next instant, the Mountains and Rivers Page erupted with brilliant light, setting off a wave of air that left everyone in the field shocked and curious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="328">"What's going on?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="330">"What happened?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="332">"Supreme! A Supreme-grade Mountains and Rivers Page has been refined!!!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
