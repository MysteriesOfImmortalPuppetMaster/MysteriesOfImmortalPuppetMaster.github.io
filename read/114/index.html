<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Several days later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo's soul entered the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He quickly assembled his body, walking down from the small mountain of mechanism parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Human Life Thread," he muttered, his steps slow and careful as he felt it out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">With the growth of his budding divine ability, his sense of the Human Life Thread atop his head deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Transmitting through the Human Life Thread, there's always some loss. Now, I can draw on the power of the 'Buddha Heart Demon Seal,' which should greatly reduce the loss along the thread!" he thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Ning Zhuo is here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Look at his head, it's really big."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Hmph, making us all wait for him. He's quite the show-off," the puppets around the first portal whispered as they watched Ning Zhuo approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Everyone else was already in place; Ning Zhuo was the last to arrive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He looked around at them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Zhou family had five people, the Zheng family had two, and the Ning family was represented only by himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"The three families are starting to mobilize. More and more people will be entering the Immortal Palace with their souls in the future," Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Once the numbers formed a scale, the traps he had set up would become increasingly ineffective, eventually unable to withstand the overwhelming force of numbers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Compared to the three families, Ning Zhuo was at a significant disadvantage, being isolated and alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Under the watchful eyes of many puppets, Ning Zhuo walked to the door, touched the portal, and selected the hanging ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Next, we need to combine forces to get through the trap at the door," Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Zheng family cultivators nodded, but the Zhou family members refused. "The five of us are enough, no need to combine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"We'll go through first, you follow in after us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Haha, who says our Zhou family doesn't have the most people?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Although Ning Zhuo was nominally the leader, the Zhou family cultivators paid him lip service, not following his orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">As Ning Xiaoren had anticipated, the Zhou family cultivators were trying to diminish Ning Zhuo's influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">They acted as if they were bravely taking on the challenge first for the benefit of the group, making it hard for Ning Zhuo to say anything outright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">However, Ning Zhuo was prepared for this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">With a thought, a teleportation circle appeared out of thin air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The circle glowed and the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Da Sheng, descended!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"What is that?" exclaimed one of the Zheng family cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Who are you!?" The Zhou family cultivators were terrified, with some of their voices trembling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"There's an enemy, quickly scatter and surround him!" Ning Zhuo shouted, displaying immense bravery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Wait, wait!" Seeing that Ning Zhuo was about to give the order to attack, the Zhou family cultivators hurriedly stopped him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Something's off, don't engage!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Calm down, calm down, everyone, let's not be hasty!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Zhou family cultivators had suffered significant losses before and knew well the combat strength of Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">They realized they were not on the same level and that engaging in a fight would be disastrous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The puppets from the three families were on high alert, keeping a close watch on Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Yuan Dasheng's red body, golden bones, and numerous black stripes all over gave him a menacing appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The injuries sustained during previous battles had been expertly repaired by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Though the repairs had somewhat weakened his abilities, he still looked as formidable as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In short, the puppets from the three families spread out, forming a loose circle around Yuan Dasheng, but no one dared to make a move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Yuan Dasheng glanced around at everyone, then proceeded towards Door One without paying them any attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the next moment, he pushed the door open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Spears shot out from the walls, which Yuan Dasheng easily deflected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">A heavy hammer dropped from above, but with a slight maneuver, Yuan Dasheng sent it spinning into the corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Then, Yuan Dasheng lifted the hammer, resetting the trap mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He continued forward, leaping through walls and obstacles as if joyfully frolicking in a forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The people peering through the door gap were speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"What is with this mechanical ape?" Ning Zhuo looked at the Zhou family cultivators. "You seem to know something."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Zhou family cultivators vehemently denied it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">One of them said, "Did you notice? This mechanical ape is different from us. We were assembled from parts and gained mobility. But this mechanical ape was directly transported here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Another Zhou family cultivator added, "Look at us; we all have wooden bodies, but this one is clearly a notch above us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"If we were to attack it, we would surely lose more than win."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Zheng family cultivators stared at Yuan Dasheng inside Room Two, utterly confused. "But why did this mechanical ape appear?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Perhaps..." Ning Zhuo pondered, "perhaps it's a special arrangement by the three masters to teach us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Look at this mechanical ape; it clearly has the strength to pass through Room Two, but it's jumping around the traps as if playing or maybe showing us how to get through."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Hearing Ning Zhuo's words, everyone felt enlightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">A Zheng family cultivator slapped his thigh. "That seems to be the case!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Zhou family cultivators remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Since being wiped out by the Golden Blood Battle Ape once, they had returned to their family and actively studied and speculated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Their initial guess was that Yuan Dasheng was a Lava Core demon ape that had heard the Bell of Transmission, successfully cultivated, entered the Immortal Palace, and assembled a monkey puppet to compete for the inheritance of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">However, this guess had an obvious flaw: the mechanism parts in Room One were all made of uniform wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The materials used for the Golden Blood Battle Ape were clearly different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Next, they speculated whether this might be an arrangement by the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">When challengers reached a certain standard, perhaps in terms of number, the palace would deploy such mechanical apes for obstruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">They also considered whether it could still be a demonic cultivator competitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">In the later stages of the Lava Immortal Palace, challengers might be allowed to switch their puppet bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">They had various other guesses as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The appearance of the Golden Blood Battle Ape was similar to its former self, but to others, it was hard to associate it with its original form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After all, many people thought monkeys looked essentially the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Even when looking at different human races, there is often a kind of facial blindness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After today, having seen Yuan Dasheng being transported rather than entering the palace as a spirit, some of the Zhou family's previous speculations stood out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Main Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Dragon Tortoise Fire Spirit constantly moved its jaw, grinding its teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">It snorted through its nose, both anxious and angry, occasionally clenching its fist and pounding the armrest of the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">It was the one who knew the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Seeing Ning Zhuo openly use Yuan Dasheng while everyone else remained clueless, even some informed Zhou family cultivators were covering for him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">What a bunch of fools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Not a single smart one among them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Dragon Tortoise Fire Spirit grew increasingly enraged, but it couldn't say a word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Its anger caused the entire Lava Immortal Palace to start shaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">At the top of Lava Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">In the misty clouds, City Lord Meng Kui opened his eyes immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Seeing the Lava Immortal Palace on the verge of turmoil again, he sighed helplessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">His expression became serious as he prepared to activate the array to suppress the impending chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo observed Yuan Dasheng through the door crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Since gaining full spiritual autonomy, Yuan Dasheng's reactions had become more acute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">When facing complex obstacles and traps, its choices had become more varied, no longer as monotonous as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">It was as if it had truly come to life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">However, in Ning Zhuo's perception, his control over Yuan Dasheng still felt impeded, as if shrouded by a thick gray cloth, making it uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"This mechanical ape is staying in Room Two, neither advancing nor retreating, seemingly playing with the traps."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Let's continue and ignore it for now!" Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Zhou family cultivators hesitated, "The traps at the door have reset, we need to combine forces to counter them. If we enter Room Two and get attacked by the ape, what should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo shrugged. "We can't just do nothing this time, right? Staying here until our soul power is exhausted is worse than taking a risk." This statement elicited strong agreement from the two Zheng family cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The Zhou family cultivators exchanged glances and finally nodded. "The five of us will form a unit. You follow behind. If the mechanical ape attacks us, you three must hold it off to allow us to separate into individual units." Forming a large mechanical puppet greatly reduces combat effectiveness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo agreed to the Zhou family cultivators' plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Zhou familyâ€™s large puppet squeezed through the doorway, enduring the wall-mounted spears, deflecting the heavy hammers, and bypassing the ground nets, clearing the traps at the entrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Seeing that Yuan Dasheng did not attack, the Zhou family cultivators sighed in relief. "Come in now." Thus, Ning Zhuo and the other two pushed the door open and entered effortlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">At this moment, Yuan Dasheng let out a low growl, suddenly turning to attack the group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The Zhou family cultivators were horrified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Some wanted to counterattack, some wanted to turn and flee, while others decided to stand their ground, causing the Zhou family's combined puppet to spin in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Yuan Dasheng, like a falling star, crashed and shattered them directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"As expected, we still have to fight!" Ning Zhuo shouted and rushed forward bravely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Yuan Dasheng reached out, easily plucking Ning Zhuo's puppet head and tossing it into the nearest trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Everyone saw this scene clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Bang, bang, bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Yuan Dasheng's punches were heavy, smashing each puppet one by one, completely defeating them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The cultivators could only return their souls to their bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Yuan Dasheng then jumped into the trap, retrieved Ning Zhuo's head, and reattached it to the puppet's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Let's go." Ning Zhuo stamped his foot, shook his hands, and started moving with Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Zheng family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Why did it end so quickly?" someone asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Zheng family cultivator, with a solemn face, replied eagerly, "Although we failed, we gained significant information. We discovered the guardian mechanisms of the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Zhou family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">New intelligence led to new insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"So, it seems that the mechanical monkey is a specific obstacle arranged by the Lava Immortal Palace when the number of challengers in a group is too large to maintain the difficulty of the challenge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Yes, that seems likely!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Why hasn't Ning Zhuo returned yet?" Ning Xiaoren wondered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"That's right." He looked at the reports from the other two families and understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Ning Zhuo was unlucky. His puppet head was removed and thrown into a trap. He can only return once his soul power is exhausted." Ning Xiaoren sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Meanwhile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Outside Lava Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Two black-clad demonic cultivators stood at the foot of the mountain, gazing up at the Lava Immortal City halfway up the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"The call for help came from here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Heh, who would have thought that a genius like Han Ming would end up here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"She usually doesn't give us the time of day. Once we rescue her this time, let's see if she remains so arrogant." "If it weren't for the orders from above, I wouldn't want to save her at all! Anyway, let's enter the city and find Han Ming as soon as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
