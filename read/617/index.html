<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The yin wind howled, carrying countless ghostly figures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A dense miasma of yin energy enveloped the city's defenses, severely disrupting the divine sense of the defending cultivators and restricting their vision to a mere three zhang ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Big-Headed Ghosts, Small-Headed Ghosts, Hanging Ghosts, Soul-Hooking Geckos, and more soared on the wind or scaled the city walls, relentlessly assaulting the ramparts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Hold the line! Hold the line!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Father!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Die, you damn ghosts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Don't push too far forward!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Form ranks! Form ranks!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Aaaah!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The cacophony of battle cries, commands, screams, and furious roars wove together into a grim anthem of the Yang Realm's living defending their homeland.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The endless, brutal, and numb Ghost Tide clashed with the courage, valor, and sacrifices of the living - two invisible forces locked in a deadly dance, their fates intertwined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Tie Guzheng, commander of the City Guard, coordinated the city's defenses. Reports from each sector arrived in succession, his face hardening with each update.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This Ghost Tide rivaled the final stages of past invasions, its scale surpassing all historical records. Had the White Paper City Lord not offered exorbitant bounties to recruit every able-bodied warrior from the surrounding villages and towns, White Paper Immortal City would have already fallen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Even so, our casualties are mounting rapidly..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Worse still, a highly trained and disciplined army of Yin Soldiers lurks beyond the battlefield, watching with predatory eyes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"And what about our forces?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Even Lian Tiegu and the City Guard couldn't be considered true Cultivation armies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The only force in the entire city that could barely qualify was the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In stark contrast, the defenders' true reliance remained on the White Paper Immortal City itself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Thud... Thud... Thud...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The earth trembled as a shadow darker than the night, as massive as a small mountain, emerged from the depths of the dense Yin Tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">It crashed through the curtain-like yin wind, trampling low-level ghost mists that couldn't escape its path, and lumbered toward the city gates with its ponderous, towering frame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Dead Bone Giant!" Tie Guzheng leaped to his feet, his entire body tensed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The alarm bells of the White Paper Immortal City rang out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Countless black and dark gray bones intertwined and fused together, forming a colossal monstrosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Each bone was thick, gnarled, and weathered, eroded by the passage of time and the corrosive influence of yin energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">With every step, the ground shuddered as if struck by a massive hammer, the thunderous impacts echoing across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Though its gait was slow, its strides were immense. In just a dozen steps, it stood before the city walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The towering fortifications barely reached its neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The cultivators atop the walls found themselves eye-to-eye with the giant's gaping maw and cavernous nostrils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Dead Bone Giant raised its palm and slammed it against the city wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The once-immovable wall shuddered violently, then crackled like tearing paper. Cracks spiderwebbed across its surface, spreading rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The giant struck twice more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The violent tremors rippled through the wall and into the surrounding area, shaking the defending soldiers off their feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The ghostly creatures fared even worse. Caught between the Dead Bone Giant's onslaught and the White Paper Immortal City's defenses, nearly all were annihilated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"We can't let it continue this rampage!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Determined, Tie Guzheng personally charged forward, wielding an iron fan taller than himself. He lunged at the giant's face, initiating direct combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Though only at the Golden Core stage, the Dead Bone Giant displayed Nascent Soul-level combat prowess within the Ghost Tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Tie Guzheng, also at the Golden Core stage, possessed comparable strength. As commander of the City Guard, he could channel the White Paper Immortal City's power with every movement, making him a formidable opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The two clashed for nearly ten rounds, neither gaining the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"We're here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Charge with me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Qing-Jiao Army arrived, Qing Chi still leading the charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The army swept across the wall like a whirlwind, slaughtering ghostly creatures in droves and inflicting heavy casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Once again, Qing Chi became the center of attention, basking in the glory of her performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The more she fought, the more invigorated she became. The Military Heart she had cultivated had evolved into a Military Seed, granting her constant awareness of the Qing-Jiao Army's overall condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"The Paper Armor Technique and Yin Crossing Technique are truly invaluable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Little Ma really knows his stuff. He chose the perfect path for us right away."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Vigorous Yang Manor is practically defunct now. When will he return to fight alongside me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Even amidst the battle, Qing Chi's thoughts raced like lightning as she missed Jiao Ma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Far away, the Vanguard General of the Underworld Army grew restless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The dense Yin Tide couldn't block his gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He surveyed the battlefield: Tie Guzheng was holding off the Dead Bone Giant, Qing Chi was clearing the surrounding area, and the White Paper Immortal City was regaining its footing thanks to the combined efforts of the two warriors and their army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This was the Ghost Tide's strongest point!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">From here on, the Ghost Tide's offensive would gradually weaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Flying Spear Ghost General," the Vanguard General suddenly commanded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">A Ghost General immediately stepped forward from the ranks to his left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"This subordinate awaits your orders!" the Ghost General saluted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Vanguard General reached into the pen holder on his desk, selected three Military Tokens, and tossed them to the Flying Spear Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"I grant you three units of military power," the Vanguard General commanded. "Spare no effort in your attempt to kill even Tie Guzheng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"This subordinate obeys."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Flying Spear Ghost General grasped the three Military Tokens and immediately left the Vanguard General's tent, ascending the high platform in the plaza.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He stood tall, gazing intently for a moment before drawing a Magic Artifact spear. With a flourish, he hurled it into the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The spear sliced through the raging yin wind with unstoppable force. In the blink of an eye, it hurtled toward Tie Guzheng's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Tie Guzheng's eyes widened in fury. With every ounce of strength, he raised his iron fan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sparks and golden light erupted as the spear struck the fan. The ear-splitting metallic clang made the surrounding cultivators wince.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The spear pierced through the fan's ribs. Tie Guzheng tumbled backward, rolling three times before scrambling to his feet, his face pale with shock. He had narrowly escaped death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Seeing Tie Guzheng now on guard, the Flying Spear Ghost General sighed inwardly. He retrieved another Magic Artifact spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Channeling his Golden Core energy and expending a second Military Token, he unleashed another full-powered throw, amplified by the Military Power Amplification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This time, the long spear wasn't aimed at Tie Guzheng, but at Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Tie Guzheng sensed grave danger. "Damn it, he thought, this flying spear is both immensely powerful and treacherously elusive. I only detected it when it was right in front of me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"If there's a second shot, how will the others defend themselves?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">With that thought, Tie Guzheng immediately ordered, "Quick! Get the Qing-Jiao Army off the wall!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But it was too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The second flying spear had already traversed multiple li, hurtling toward the wall to shatter Qing Chi's skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Unaware of the danger, Qing Chi was still fiercely engaged in battle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Just as her life hung by a thread, a gray-white bone staff materialized out of thin air and struck the spear's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The spear's trajectory veered wildly off course. By the time it reached the city wall, it had deviated so severely that it pierced the air, soaring over White Paper Immortal City and vanishing into the distant horizon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The violent collision between the staff and spear erupted with such force that it shattered the surrounding yin energy, creating a tremendous shockwave that drew the attention of many nearby cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Yet Qing Chi remained oblivious, still engrossed in her fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Qing Yan, who had been protecting Qing Chi, nervously glanced around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Flying Spear Ghost General's pupils constricted as he immediately used his last Military Token, channeling its power into the third flying spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">His throwing motion was even faster than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">This time, his target remained Qing Chi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">However, before the third spear could travel even half a li, it inexplicably vanished mid-air, as if it had never existed at all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The Flying Spear Ghost General's face twisted in disbelief and shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Having failed to kill the enemy with all three spears, he reluctantly braced himself and returned to the main camp to report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The atmosphere inside the command tent was markedly different from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The Vanguard General showed no anger toward the Flying Spear Ghost General, his expression icy. "White Paper Immortal City has received reinforcements. You are pardoned this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">He dismissed the Ghost General with perfunctory instructions to rejoin his unit, his attention focused entirely on the spot where the third spear had mysteriously disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The appearance of the bone club was one thing, but what truly concerned the Vanguard General was the reason behind the spear's vanishing act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The event had unfolded too quickly for him to discern any clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Dead Bone Giant opened its massive maw, unleashing a surging wave of Death Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Tie Guzheng unfurled his iron fan, unleashing a gale of metallic wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The two forces collided, weakening the Death Qi wave by eighty percent, yet it still surged over the city wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Death Qi wave struck Tie Guzheng, sending him staggering back dozens of steps until he crashed into the city gate tower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">With no further obstacles, the Dead Bone Giant suddenly lowered its head and charged, slamming its shoulder against the White Paper City Wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The wall buckled under the impact, its surface warping like a thick stack of paper twisted violently, bulging inward into the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The sight sent shivers down the spines of the witnessing cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The Dead Bone Giant retreated, preparing for a second assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"No!" Sensing imminent danger, the cultivators frantically attacked, but their strikes proved futile, barely scratching the giant's bone-armored hide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">At that critical moment, a scroll materialized mid-air, unfurling above the Dead Bone Giant to reveal a massive character for "Suppress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The character detached from the scroll and flew directly to the giant's forehead, branding itself deeply into its bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Dead Bone Giant's aura, combat prowess, and speed plummeted, as if a giant now carried a mountain on its shoulders, its threat diminished drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Then, the bone club that had appeared earlier materialized behind the giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The bone club suddenly expanded, growing taller than the city wall and thicker than a main pillar in the blink of an eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Bang! Bang! Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The bone club slammed into the Dead Bone Giant's back, each strike shattering massive chunks of bone. The third blow crushed its spine, causing the giant to fold in half and collapse, paralyzed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Tie Guzheng and the others watching this scene erupted in cheers, realizing powerful reinforcements had arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In the next moment, the bone club shrank and landed in the hand of a gray-robed cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He wore a white bone mask, his eye sockets sunken and empty, save for two eerie blue ghost flames. This was Bone Tomb Daoist of the Soul Devouring Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Near the blank scroll, another cultivator materialized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">His face was gaunt, framed by three wisps of a long beard. His eyes crackled with electric intensity, radiating the refined aura of a scholar. It was Zhou Wenyan, the Confucian cultivator from the All-Book Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The final figure appeared directly beside Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Dressed in a dark azure Daoist robe, he stood as straight as a pine tree, his hands clasped behind his back, perched proudly atop the city wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Demons and monsters, how dare you invade my Immortal City!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">His jade-like face bore a tightly closed vertical mark between his brows, his eyes blazing with undisguised contempt and fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Supreme talent - All Under my Gaze is Emptiness!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">In the next instant, the vertical mark on his forehead split open, revealing a third, vertically oriented eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">His eyes blazed with white light - pure, unyielding, and majestic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Wherever the white light fell, everything was erased, vanishing without a trace. No ghostly creature could withstand it; the only difference was that those with higher cultivation could resist for a few breaths before disappearing into thin air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The vertical eye on the forehead of the three-eyed cultivator swept across the section of the White Paper City Wall, and all the ghostly creatures there vanished like smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He turned and swept his gaze across the left flank of the wall. All ghostly creatures and yin winds disappeared from that section as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Yang Sanyan of the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Demon Subduing Hall is here," the young cultivator announced, his voice cold and brimming with arrogance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">All the cultivators on the wall turned to look, their faces filled with surprise, shock, and awe. In an instant, their morale soared!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Qing Chi stared curiously at Yang Sanyan, who stood just a few feet away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">In the distance, the Vanguard General of the Underworld Army pondered for a moment, then sighed and ordered, "Retreat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">These three cultivators possessed astonishing power, each at the Golden Core level. But Yang Sanyan was even more extraordinary, displaying combat prowess that hinted at the Nascent Soul realm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Yang Sanyan's vertical eye snapped shut. He turned slightly, extended his right hand, and wordlessly reached for Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Qing Chi's hair stood on end, and she instinctively retreated to create distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">But in the next instant, Yang Sanyan's hand clamped down on her shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"Ghostman Clan girl, don't go running off!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Qing Yan paled in terror and immediately dropped to one knee, signaling his allegiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Yang Sanyan snorted coldly. "If not for that, you'd already be dead. My brother mentioned you in his letter, along with someone named Jiao Ma."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"He told me he had sworn loyalty to Jiao Ma."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Now he's dead!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"How did Jiao Ma protect my brother? You're close to him - go fetch him here. He will answer for my brother's death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Qing Chi struggled, but Yang Sanyan swiftly subdued her completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Her eyes widened in disbelief. Even with the Military Power Amplification bolstering her strength, she couldn't resist him at all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Helpless, Qing Yan gritted his teeth. "Please wait here, Lord. I will summon Young Master Jiao Ma immediately."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"Make him come pay his respects to me at once." Yang Sanyan strode away, carrying Qing Chi like a kitten. His towering frame dwarfed her petite form, making her look utterly helpless in his grasp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Yang Sanyan strode onto the city gate tower, immediately driving away the cultivator stationed there. He planted himself in the main seat with an air of authority, casually tossing Qing Chi at his feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">He ceased fighting, leaving Zhou Wenyan of the All-Book Pavilion and Bone Tomb Daoist of the Soul Devouring Sect to swiftly eliminate the remaining ghostly creatures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Seeing the battle resolved, Tie Guzheng thanked Zhou Wenyan and Bone Tomb Daoist before approaching Yang Sanyan to pay his respects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">"Incompetent fool," Yang Sanyan snapped without acknowledging him. "Go oversee the city's defenses and don't bother me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The only person he wished to see was Jiao Ma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Soon, led by Qing Yan, Ning Zhuo arrived at the city gate tower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Qing Yan used his divine sense to urgently warn Jiao Ma, "Remember your manners. Yang Sanyan is from the Myriad Manifestations Sect, with extraordinary power and status. More importantly, Qing Chi is still in his hands."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">"Hmph, so you're Jiao Ma? Give me..." Yang Sanyan sneered, but his words were cut short.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">In the next instant, Ning Zhuo thrust both palms forward, shattering the entire city gate tower.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
