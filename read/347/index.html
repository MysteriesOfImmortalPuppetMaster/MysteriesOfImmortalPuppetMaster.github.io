<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"So, Meng Zizhong changed tactics again, using the Earth Python technique. Since the offensive was ineffective, he adopted a control method to restrict the Black Wind Tiger Demon and maintain the initiative for himself."<br/>
<br/>
"I've learned something."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully contemplated, continually analyzing Meng Zizhong's tactical choices. The latter was constantly probing, quickly adjusting the type of magic based on the results, thereby keeping control of the battlefield situation in his own hands.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo put himself in Meng Zizhong's position and asked himself: "If I were Meng Zizhong, could I do this?"<br/>
He shook his head inwardly.<br/>
<br/>
On the surface, what Meng Zizhong did wasn't particularly impressive, just ordinary.<br/>
<br/>
But ordinary things are not easy to accomplish in practice.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was self-aware, knowing he lacked combat experience and proficient spellcasting skills, making it easy to lose the rhythm.<br/>
<br/>
Although it seemed there was no close combat between the two sides, in reality, the frequency of exchanges was very high.<br/>
If Ning Zhuo was just a bit slow, hesitated for a moment, he would miss the opportunity, allowing the Black Wind Tiger Demon to close in.<br/>
Once this happened, Ning Zhuo's situation would become very passive.<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Zizhong has clearly immersed himself in earth-based magic for many years, with profound attainments. His Earth Spike technique has precise and tricky angles of attack, specifically targeting the lower body, focusing on the enemy's weaknesses. He is truly a role model for us."<br/>
<br/>
"I've learned, I've learned."<br/>
<br/>
The wave of attacks from the Earth Spike technique left a deep impression on Ning Zhuo. He secretly made a note to study this move well, absorb the strengths of others, and transform them into his own to become more excellent.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon roared, its cry full of pain.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong maintained the Earth Python technique while fully squeezing his spirit, controlling his Golden Core, and expending magical power to cast the Earth Spike technique.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to before, this time he cast the Earth Spike technique with particular difficulty and slowness.<br/>
<br/>
It was like two strong men wrestling, with neither having excess strength to make additional attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Earth Spike, Earth Spike, Earth Spike!<br/>
<br/>
The first Earth Spike struck the Black Wind Tiger Demon's thigh, piercing its leg bone.<br/>
<br/>
The second Earth Spike aimed to pierce the Black Wind Tiger Demon's eye socket, but it barely dodged, slicing off half the skin on its cheek.<br/>
<br/>
The third Earth Spike targeted the immobilized chest of the Black Wind Tiger Demon, aiming for its heart!<br/>
If this hit, the Black Wind Tiger Demon would be dead or at least severely injured.<br/>
At the critical moment, the Black Wind Tiger Demon unleashed its potential, activating its demonic technique of Flesh Grinder.<br/>
<br/>
The muscles on its chest suddenly thickened, forming small vortexes, gripping the incoming Earth Spike. After a few breaths of stalemate, the muscles, like living creatures, exerted force, directly crushing the tip of the Earth Spike!<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon let out a roar, frantically exerting force, gradually raising its arms.<br/>
<br/>
The Earth Python's body continuously emitted sounds of bone-cracking, like giant strings being plucked repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Cracks rapidly spread across the entire body of the Earth Python.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the Black Wind Tiger Demon violently raised both arms, completely shattering the two Earth Pythons into more than a dozen segments.<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon raised its head and roared, thus breaking free and charging towards Meng Zizhong.<br/>
<br/>
"What a pity," the Fox God sighed upon seeing this. "Meng Zizhong's Earth Python technique is limited in its attainment. If he could cultivate the Earth Dragon technique, he would definitely be able to trap the Black Wind Tiger Demon in one move."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, however, focused on the charging Black Wind Tiger Demon and said, "Its Gigantification technique isn't actually first-rate."<br/>
<br/>
"The reason it's so effective in actual combat is mainly because it has cultivated the Flesh and Blood Swallowing technique."<br/>
"This demonic technique is best at nurturing blood and flesh, greatly increasing its defense after gigantification."<br/>
"This battle still has a long way to go!"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong's expression was cold as he continuously retreated, creating distance while casting Earth Wall techniques, doing his utmost to slow the Black Wind Tiger Demon's charge.<br/>
<br/>
But his several rounds of full-power spellcasting earlier had consumed a considerable amount of his magical power, leaving his Golden Core dim and lackluster.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon repeatedly crashed through the earth walls, its speed increasing rather than decreasing. Its roars were continuous, its momentum constantly surging.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong helplessly realized that while he wanted to wear down the Black Wind Tiger Demon with long-range attacks, several rounds of full-power spellcasting had instead depleted his own magical power, temporarily putting him at a disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
"I can't retreat any further!"<br/>
Meng Zizhong had reached the point where he could retreat no more!<br/>
<br/>
If he retreated further, he would impact the battle of his subordinate troops. Although entering the military formation would provide him with powerful enhancements and various offensive means,<br/>
<br/>
This approach, even if successful, would be a pyrrhic victory. The other cultivators would be used as cannon fodder, suffering heavy losses.<br/>
Meng Zizhong had trained his troops diligently and cherished the elite force he had painstakingly cultivated with his time and effort.<br/>
<br/>
He gritted his teeth and thought, "So be it."<br/>
<br/>
He made a decision and ignited the God Summoning Talisman!<br/>
<br/>
The spirit-infused God Summoning Talisman burned to ashes in the blink of an eye.<br/>
<br/>
"Great Strength God, quickly possess me!" Meng Zizhong roared.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, divine light like a pillar shot down from the high heavens, piercing through the clouds and instantly enveloping Meng Zizhong.<br/>
Meng Zizhong cried out loudly, in extreme pain.<br/>
<br/>
His entire body expanded within the divine light, and in an instant, he transformed into a small giant!<br/>
"Great Strength God!" The Fox God murmured upon seeing this, revealing envy and longing.<br/>
There are distinctions among divine beings.<br/>
<br/>
Gods like the Fox God are considered earth spirits, bound to Mist-Concealing Mountain and extremely difficult to leave.<br/>
<br/>
Corresponding to earth spirits are celestial spirits.<br/>
<br/>
The Great Strength God is a celestial spirit, able to freely traverse under the sky without restrictions on its range of activity.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon finally drew Meng Zizhong into close combat.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon's offensive was as fierce as a hurricane, clearly having the upper hand.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong relied on his long-handled war hammer, gritting his teeth and continuously defending. With the aid of the God Summoning technique, he was actually able to hold his ground, trading blows with the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes were fixed, watching this scene, gaining new insights.<br/>
<br/>
"The rhythm of close combat is too fast. Although Meng Zizhong excels in magic, after being pressured for so long, he's only managed to cast one Stone Armor spell to enhance himself."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, it's the Black Wind Tiger Demon's turn to take the initiative."<br/>
Their confrontation had temporarily reached a stalemate.<br/>
At this point, Ning Zhuo could roughly assess the specific combat capabilities of the Black Wind Tiger Demon and Meng Zizhong.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon leaned towards close-quarters combat, with very weak long-range abilities. Meng Zizhong, on the other hand, had a certain level of skill in both ranged and close combat, being more balanced. In terms of ranged combat, he mainly used earth-based magic. For close combat, he used God Summoning Talismans obtained through daily worship to enhance himself.<br/>
<br/>
From the swift response of the Great Strength God, it was clear that Meng Zizhong was either very devout towards the Great Strength God or had made substantial offerings to the divine temple.<br/>
<br/>
"If these two Golden Core cultivators can't determine a victor, then what will likely decide this battle is their subordinates."<br/>
<br/>
Realizing this, Ning Zhuo turned more of his attention to other parts of the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The demon cultivators, following their king, had roared down the mountain, deliberately avoiding the clash between the two Golden Core cultivators and targeting the human cultivator army.<br/>
<br/>
The demon cultivators were like battering rams, charging directly into the crowd.<br/>
Human cultivators were repeatedly sent flying!<br/>
But they quickly got up, running back to rejoin the battle as if nothing had happened.<br/>
<br/>
These cultivators all wore uniformly designed heavy armor. The main material of the armor was Jade-Moistened Dark Steel, and with the defensive formations on the armor, when the demon cultivators' attacks landed on the armor, a portion of the force would always be deflected, unable to land solidly.<br/>
<br/>
This effect immediately reminded Ning Zhuo of the Slippery Talisman he possessed.<br/>
<br/>
"No, the armor alone couldn't achieve such defensive effectiveness."<br/>
<br/>
"There must be a large-scale formation enhancing the cultivator army, benefiting each of them greatly."<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately saw through the key point.<br/>
<br/>
This was the result of the human cultivators' earlier formation.<br/>
<br/>
The demon cultivators found it difficult to inflict fatal casualties on the heavily armored cultivators. When they entered the formation, it felt as if they had fallen into a quagmire, their every move restrained, their speed greatly reduced.<br/>
<br/>
"This should be an earth-based formation — the Sinking Earth Formation, right?" Ning Zhuo inquired, his tone somewhat uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
He had learned about the Sinking Earth Formation from books but had never witnessed it firsthand.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God nodded: "That's correct, it is the Sinking Earth Formation."<br/>
<br/>
Just as they were speaking, there was suddenly a commotion at the center of the cultivator army.<br/>
<br/>
A ground rat demon cultivator launched an attack from underground, successfully drilling through the formation disc buried four feet below the surface.<br/>
<br/>
With the formation disc broken, the entire Sinking Earth Formation began to rapidly disintegrate.<br/>
<br/>
The demon cultivators were liberated, their speed returning to normal. They seized the opportunity to counterattack, stirring up waves of bloodshed among the human cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Many human cultivators, suffering backlash from the broken formation and in poor condition, died tragically at the hands of the demon cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
In this critical moment, the core members of the Meng family among the cultivators demonstrated their prowess, stepping forward and loudly ordering: "Form battle formation!"<br/>
<br/>
After a period of chaos, the cultivator army suffered many casualties but also caught their breath, forming a battle formation.<br/>
This time, the battle formation was a dynamic one, quite different from the static formation set up earlier with formation discs.<br/>
The formation core was the main commander, and the formation eyes were the elite officers.<br/>
<br/>
As the battle formation rose, it enhanced every human cultivator. Especially the elite officers in the center felt a surge of enormous power, the enhancing force so strong that they had the illusion of being omnipotent!<br/>
<br/>
The leaders in the army were able to stand their ground against the demon cultivators, beginning a head-on confrontation.<br/>
<br/>
With them bearing the pressure, other cultivators felt relieved, maintaining the battle formation more easily and smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
This relaxed state made the dynamic formation operate faster, providing more enhancing power to the leaders.<br/>
<br/>
The human leaders gradually began to suppress the numerous demon cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
The scales of victory gradually tipped towards the human cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
One after another, demon cultivators fell under the encirclement of the cultivators, perishing on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this scene, the Black Wind Tiger Demon, unable to gain the upper hand after prolonged attacks, became anxious. Its whole body shook as it unleashed its innate ability, Night Shadow Yin Technique.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, yin energy gushed out from its entire body, and its shadow cast on the ground came to life, actively standing up like a pool of pitch-black ink.<br/>
<br/>
Just as the night shadow was about to pounce on Meng Zizhong, unexpectedly, Meng Zizhong was delighted rather than alarmed, shouting: "I've been waiting for this move!"<br/>
<br/>
The intelligence about the Black Wind Tiger Demon's innate abilities had long been exposed. How could Meng Zizhong, leading an army to attack, not have countermeasures?<br/>
A mirror flew out from his chest.<br/>
<br/>
The mirror hovered above Meng Zizhong's head, emitting mirror light that shone upon the tiger demon's shadow.<br/>
<br/>
The shadow was completely suppressed, quickly withering, and finally dissipating!<br/>
