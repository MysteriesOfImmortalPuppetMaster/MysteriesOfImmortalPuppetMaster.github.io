<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"So, Meng Zizhong changed tactics again, using the Earth Python technique. Since the offensive was ineffective, he adopted a control method to restrict the Black Wind Tiger Demon and maintain the initiative for himself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"I've learned something."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo carefully contemplated, continually analyzing Meng Zizhong's tactical choices. The latter was constantly probing, quickly adjusting the type of magic based on the results, thereby keeping control of the battlefield situation in his own hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo put himself in Meng Zizhong's position and asked himself: "If I were Meng Zizhong, could I do this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">He shook his head inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">On the surface, what Meng Zizhong did wasn't particularly impressive, just ordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">But ordinary things are not easy to accomplish in practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">Ning Zhuo was self-aware, knowing he lacked combat experience and proficient spellcasting skills, making it easy to lose the rhythm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">Although it seemed there was no close combat between the two sides, in reality, the frequency of exchanges was very high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">If Ning Zhuo was just a bit slow, hesitated for a moment, he would miss the opportunity, allowing the Black Wind Tiger Demon to close in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">Once this happened, Ning Zhuo's situation would become very passive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">"Meng Zizhong has clearly immersed himself in earth-based magic for many years, with profound attainments. His Earth Spike technique has precise and tricky angles of attack, specifically targeting the lower body, focusing on the enemy's weaknesses. He is truly a role model for us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">"I've learned, I've learned."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">The wave of attacks from the Earth Spike technique left a deep impression on Ning Zhuo. He secretly made a note to study this move well, absorb the strengths of others, and transform them into his own to become more excellent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">The Black Wind Tiger Demon roared, its cry full of pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">Meng Zizhong maintained the Earth Python technique while fully squeezing his spirit, controlling his Golden Core, and expending magical power to cast the Earth Spike technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">Compared to before, this time he cast the Earth Spike technique with particular difficulty and slowness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">It was like two strong men wrestling, with neither having excess strength to make additional attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">Earth Spike, Earth Spike, Earth Spike!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">The first Earth Spike struck the Black Wind Tiger Demon's thigh, piercing its leg bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">The second Earth Spike aimed to pierce the Black Wind Tiger Demon's eye socket, but it barely dodged, slicing off half the skin on its cheek.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">The third Earth Spike targeted the immobilized chest of the Black Wind Tiger Demon, aiming for its heart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">If this hit, the Black Wind Tiger Demon would be dead or at least severely injured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">At the critical moment, the Black Wind Tiger Demon unleashed its potential, activating its demonic technique of Flesh Grinder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">The muscles on its chest suddenly thickened, forming small vortexes, gripping the incoming Earth Spike. After a few breaths of stalemate, the muscles, like living creatures, exerted force, directly crushing the tip of the Earth Spike!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">The Black Wind Tiger Demon let out a roar, frantically exerting force, gradually raising its arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">The Earth Python's body continuously emitted sounds of bone-cracking, like giant strings being plucked repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Cracks rapidly spread across the entire body of the Earth Python.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">Finally, the Black Wind Tiger Demon violently raised both arms, completely shattering the two Earth Pythons into more than a dozen segments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Black Wind Tiger Demon raised its head and roared, thus breaking free and charging towards Meng Zizhong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"What a pity," the Fox God sighed upon seeing this. "Meng Zizhong's Earth Python technique is limited in its attainment. If he could cultivate the Earth Dragon technique, he would definitely be able to trap the Black Wind Tiger Demon in one move."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong, however, focused on the charging Black Wind Tiger Demon and said, "Its Gigantification technique isn't actually first-rate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"The reason it's so effective in actual combat is mainly because it has cultivated the Flesh and Blood Swallowing technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">"This demonic technique is best at nurturing blood and flesh, greatly increasing its defense after gigantification."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"This battle still has a long way to go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Meng Zizhong's expression was cold as he continuously retreated, creating distance while casting Earth Wall techniques, doing his utmost to slow the Black Wind Tiger Demon's charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">But his several rounds of full-power spellcasting earlier had consumed a considerable amount of his magical power, leaving his Golden Core dim and lackluster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Black Wind Tiger Demon repeatedly crashed through the earth walls, its speed increasing rather than decreasing. Its roars were continuous, its momentum constantly surging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Meng Zizhong helplessly realized that while he wanted to wear down the Black Wind Tiger Demon with long-range attacks, several rounds of full-power spellcasting had instead depleted his own magical power, temporarily putting him at a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"I can't retreat any further!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">Meng Zizhong had reached the point where he could retreat no more!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">If he retreated further, he would impact the battle of his subordinate troops. Although entering the military formation would provide him with powerful enhancements and various offensive means,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">This approach, even if successful, would be a pyrrhic victory. The other cultivators would be used as cannon fodder, suffering heavy losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Meng Zizhong had trained his troops diligently and cherished the elite force he had painstakingly cultivated with his time and effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He gritted his teeth and thought, "So be it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He made a decision and ignited the God Summoning Talisman!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The spirit-infused God Summoning Talisman burned to ashes in the blink of an eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Great Strength God, quickly possess me!" Meng Zizhong roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The next moment, divine light like a pillar shot down from the high heavens, piercing through the clouds and instantly enveloping Meng Zizhong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">Meng Zizhong cried out loudly, in extreme pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">His entire body expanded within the divine light, and in an instant, he transformed into a small giant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Great Strength God!" The Fox God murmured upon seeing this, revealing envy and longing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">There are distinctions among divine beings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Gods like the Fox God are considered earth spirits, bound to Mist-Concealing Mountain and extremely difficult to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">Corresponding to earth spirits are celestial spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">The Great Strength God is a celestial spirit, able to freely traverse under the sky without restrictions on its range of activity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">The Black Wind Tiger Demon finally drew Meng Zizhong into close combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">The Black Wind Tiger Demon's offensive was as fierce as a hurricane, clearly having the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Meng Zizhong relied on his long-handled war hammer, gritting his teeth and continuously defending. With the aid of the God Summoning technique, he was actually able to hold his ground, trading blows with the Black Wind Tiger Demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Ning Zhuo's eyes were fixed, watching this scene, gaining new insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">"The rhythm of close combat is too fast. Although Meng Zizhong excels in magic, after being pressured for so long, he's only managed to cast one Stone Armor spell to enhance himself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">"This time, it's the Black Wind Tiger Demon's turn to take the initiative."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Their confrontation had temporarily reached a stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">At this point, Ning Zhuo could roughly assess the specific combat capabilities of the Black Wind Tiger Demon and Meng Zizhong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">The Black Wind Tiger Demon leaned towards close-quarters combat, with very weak long-range abilities. Meng Zizhong, on the other hand, had a certain level of skill in both ranged and close combat, being more balanced. In terms of ranged combat, he mainly used earth-based magic. For close combat, he used God Summoning Talismans obtained through daily worship to enhance himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">From the swift response of the Great Strength God, it was clear that Meng Zizhong was either very devout towards the Great Strength God or had made substantial offerings to the divine temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">"If these two Golden Core cultivators can't determine a victor, then what will likely decide this battle is their subordinates."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Realizing this, Ning Zhuo turned more of his attention to other parts of the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">The demon cultivators, following their king, had roared down the mountain, deliberately avoiding the clash between the two Golden Core cultivators and targeting the human cultivator army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">The demon cultivators were like battering rams, charging directly into the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Human cultivators were repeatedly sent flying!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">But they quickly got up, running back to rejoin the battle as if nothing had happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">These cultivators all wore uniformly designed heavy armor. The main material of the armor was Jade-Moistened Dark Steel, and with the defensive formations on the armor, when the demon cultivators' attacks landed on the armor, a portion of the force would always be deflected, unable to land solidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">This effect immediately reminded Ning Zhuo of the Slippery Talisman he possessed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">"No, the armor alone couldn't achieve such defensive effectiveness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">"There must be a large-scale formation enhancing the cultivator army, benefiting each of them greatly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo immediately saw through the key point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This was the result of the human cultivators' earlier formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The demon cultivators found it difficult to inflict fatal casualties on the heavily armored cultivators. When they entered the formation, it felt as if they had fallen into a quagmire, their every move restrained, their speed greatly reduced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"This should be an earth-based formation â€” the Sinking Earth Formation, right?" Ning Zhuo inquired, his tone somewhat uncertain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He had learned about the Sinking Earth Formation from books but had never witnessed it firsthand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Fox God nodded: "That's correct, it is the Sinking Earth Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Just as they were speaking, there was suddenly a commotion at the center of the cultivator army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">A ground rat demon cultivator launched an attack from underground, successfully drilling through the formation disc buried four feet below the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">With the formation disc broken, the entire Sinking Earth Formation began to rapidly disintegrate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The demon cultivators were liberated, their speed returning to normal. They seized the opportunity to counterattack, stirring up waves of bloodshed among the human cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Many human cultivators, suffering backlash from the broken formation and in poor condition, died tragically at the hands of the demon cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">In this critical moment, the core members of the Meng family among the cultivators demonstrated their prowess, stepping forward and loudly ordering: "Form battle formation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">After a period of chaos, the cultivator army suffered many casualties but also caught their breath, forming a battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">This time, the battle formation was a dynamic one, quite different from the static formation set up earlier with formation discs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The formation core was the main commander, and the formation eyes were the elite officers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">As the battle formation rose, it enhanced every human cultivator. Especially the elite officers in the center felt a surge of enormous power, the enhancing force so strong that they had the illusion of being omnipotent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The leaders in the army were able to stand their ground against the demon cultivators, beginning a head-on confrontation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">With them bearing the pressure, other cultivators felt relieved, maintaining the battle formation more easily and smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This relaxed state made the dynamic formation operate faster, providing more enhancing power to the leaders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The human leaders gradually began to suppress the numerous demon cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The scales of victory gradually tipped towards the human cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">One after another, demon cultivators fell under the encirclement of the cultivators, perishing on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Seeing this scene, the Black Wind Tiger Demon, unable to gain the upper hand after prolonged attacks, became anxious. Its whole body shook as it unleashed its innate ability, Night Shadow Yin Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The next moment, yin energy gushed out from its entire body, and its shadow cast on the ground came to life, actively standing up like a pool of pitch-black ink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Just as the night shadow was about to pounce on Meng Zizhong, unexpectedly, Meng Zizhong was delighted rather than alarmed, shouting: "I've been waiting for this move!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The intelligence about the Black Wind Tiger Demon's innate abilities had long been exposed. How could Meng Zizhong, leading an army to attack, not have countermeasures?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">A mirror flew out from his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">The mirror hovered above Meng Zizhong's head, emitting mirror light that shone upon the tiger demon's shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">The shadow was completely suppressed, quickly withering, and finally dissipating!</paragraph><br/><br/>
