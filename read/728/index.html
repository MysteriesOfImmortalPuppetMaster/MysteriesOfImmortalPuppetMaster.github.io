<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Hold!" A sharp shout drew all eyes to the speaker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Meng Wuyan, Vice Peak Master of Purple Thunder Peak, stepped forward with his Cloud Body Clone. A fleeting spark of lightning flashed in his narrow, violet eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A smile played on his lips as he said, "Your esteemed discussions have been meticulously reasoned, each point building upon the last. Yet, there is one among us who far surpasses Wen Ruanyu, Duan Senzhang, Qin De, and Zhong Dao combined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"She is the true key to the entire White Paper Immortal City affair."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Tuo Kuahuang snorted, his brow furrowed. "Stop playing coy and just tell us who it is!" His patience was wearing thin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The crowd's gazes, sharp as needles, pinned Meng Wuyan to the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Though pressed for an answer, Meng Wuyan maintained his deliberate pace. He slowly opened his palm, and swirling clouds coalesced into several illusory objects:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">* An ancient Jade Slip bound with a strand of azure silk, its surface crisscrossed with cracks yet radiating a faint, timeless glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">* A delicate infant's rattle woven from Blood-Dan Vine, its clapper a teardrop-shaped stone imbued with primordial clear Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">* A scorched fragment of a yellowed local gazette, its faded characters barely legible. The words "Meng Clan's infant daughter, entrusted to the clouds" stood out, the ink stains resembling dried blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Tuo Kuahuang's impatience grew. He was about to bark an order when Meng Wuyan finally spoke, each word measured and deliberate: "The person I speak of is Bei, Yao, Yin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">A hush fell over the entire hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Tuo Jianhuang recoiled slightly, then retorted, "Are you saying Meng Yaoyin isn't dead? That she's still alive?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Meng Wuyan's expression turned sorrowful as he slowly shook his head. His voice dropped to a low rumble. "Her Life Cloud Tablet has already shattered. She passed away long ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"However, during my investigation, I made a surprising discovery: Meng Yaoyin wasn't just a simple rogue cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"She may not even have known it herself, but she was actually a descendant of our Meng Clan, a branch that had been separated from the main family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"And these are ironclad proofs!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Bei Wuyan extended his palm, displaying the material evidence he had just presented to the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Silence descended once more, but this time it was heavy with suppressed tension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Tuo Jianhuang reacted violently, waving his hand to unleash a powerful gust of wind and roaring, "Lies! This is impossible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ling Juejian crossed his arms and sneered coldly. "Meng Wuyan, do you take us for fools? Since Wen Ruanyu's report, all Eight Peaks have been investigating this matter with full force. We've already turned Meng Yaoyin's background inside out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"She was a pure rogue cultivator with no connection whatsoever to the Meng Clan of Purple Thunder Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"As for your so-called ironclad proofs, ha! I have a question for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Why is it that none of the other seven peaks uncovered even a shred of evidence? Why is it only your Purple Thunder Peak that has managed to gather so much?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Lei Feng collected all this evidence? And there's so much of it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Hahahaha!" Tuo Jianhuang roared with laughter, the sound shaking the air in waves. "Purple Thunder Peak is truly regressing! Not only did they appoint a Demon Cultivator as Vice Peak Master, but they've also concocted this absurd scheme to monopolize White Paper Immortal City!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"You damn liar! Come up with a decent excuse! Do you think we're fools, trying to fool us with this garbage?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Before his words could fade, Tuo Jianhuang swung his massive hand, transforming it into a colossal claw of spiritual energy. He lunged at the evidence, intending to crush it in a fit of rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Meng Wuyan immediately retreated, a sharp glint flashing in his narrow, violet eyes. His retreat deliberately exposed the evidence to Tuo Jianhuang's attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But in the next instant, golden patterns swirled at Wang Rong's fingertips. With a gentle flick of his hand, he deflected Tuo Jianhuang's spiritual energy claw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Let me see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Wang Wu beckoned lightly, drawing all the evidence before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He scanned each item with his divine sense, finally settling on the Jade Slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">After a moment, a playful, almost mocking admiration surfaced on his face. "Ah... every word drips with blood, every phrase overflows with sentiment. The meticulous detail and painstaking research in this 'Bei Clan Genealogy' are truly remarkable. Deputy Peak Lord Bei, you've truly outdone yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The purple Qi on Bei Wuyan's face vanished inward as he straightened his posture, his voice rising with righteous indignation: "Do you, Fellow Daoists, truly believe these are fabrications?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"These are undeniable truths!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Consider this: Meng Yaoyin was our Sect's Golden Core True Disciple, a status that cannot be forged."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"It was her tireless efforts that saved White Paper Immortal City many years ago. Without her, the city would have been destroyed long ago!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"This woman not only carries the Bei Clan's legitimate bloodline but is also the savior who rebuilt White Paper Immortal City! What greater righteousness could there be?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Without her life-risking protection, White Paper City would have become a ghastly den of ghosts and thieves! Where would Wen Ruanyu's current educational achievements be without her?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"If we acknowledge her true identity, White Paper City rightfully belongs to our Sect! This is the most just and proper course!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Wen Ruanyu himself deeply admires Meng Yaoyin. Otherwise, he wouldn't have remained in White Paper Immortal City for so many years. If our Sect seeks to reclaim the city and preserve Meng Yaoyin's hard-won achievements, how could Wen Ruanyu possibly defy her dying wish and refuse to cooperate fully?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"With this, why would we need to resort to your elaborate schemes, threats, and false promises?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Silence fell over the assembly once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The fury on Tuo Jianhuang's face seemed to churn like molten lava, while Ling Juejian's sword aura radiated chilling intensity. Wang Qi's smiling lips concealed an icy coldness beneath their apparent warmth. Xi Zifang lowered his head, his expression unreadable, while Lu Zhenshu remained immersed in his book.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">From his seat of honor, Wei Ji's pitch-black pupils reflected Meng Wuyan's impassioned, illusory figure, as well as the expressions of everyone present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Bei Clan of Purple Thunder Peak was wise to recruit a Demon Cultivator like Meng Wuyan as their Vice Peak Master, Wei Ji mused inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Meng Wuyan's method was far more precise and ingenious than any of the strategies discussed earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">By establishing Meng Yaoyin's true identity, Wen Ruanyu would have no grounds to resist, and the entire White Paper Immortal City would be brought under the righteous banner of "repaying kindness" and "inheriting her dying wish," leaving them in an utterly vulnerable position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Duanmu Zhang, Zhong Dao, Qin De... none of these troublesome figures would need to be confronted directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But this plan will never be approved, Wei Ji thought with crystal clarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">For if this were acknowledged, the Bei Clan would seize the ultimate moral high ground. Under the guise of "kinsmen of the benefactor," the Meng Clan could not only gain a foothold in White Paper Immortal City but also dominate the distribution of its resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">And the deceased Meng Yaoyin would become a sharp banner planted by the Meng Clan into the heart of White Paper City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The method was sound, easier to execute than previous plans, and beneficial to the Myriad Manifestations Sect - especially advantageous for the Meng Clan of Purple Thunder Peak!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">But what about the other peaks?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Would Tuo Jianhuang, Ling Juejian, and the others willingly become vassals?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Bei Wuyan turned to Wei Ji. "Peak Lord Wei Ji, as the master of Heavy Formation Peak, you discern the truth behind all phenomena. What is your judgment on the authenticity of this matter, guided by righteousness?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Please..." Wei Ji's pitch-black eyes met Bei Wuyan's violet pupils, their gazes separated by an invisible Glazed barrier, calm and detached.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He spoke slowly, his voice low: "Heavy Formation Peak has no intention of interfering in the White Paper Immortal City's conflict over interests."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"However, after this calamity, less than one percent of the city's Grand Formation remains. Once the dust settles, its reconstruction, defense, and maintenance - fundamental to protecting the Dao and safeguarding the people - must be undertaken solely by Heavy Formation Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">As his words faded, the Cloud Void fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">This silence, though similar to the one Meng Wuyan had previously created, carried a completely different weight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Tuo Kuahuang's fury subsided, Ling Juejian's icy demeanor softened, and Wang Wu nodded with a smile...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">No one objected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Wei Ji was merely the Vice Peak Master of Heavy Formation Peak, but in convening this Eight Peaks council, he represented Peak Master Dong Chen, who also served as the current Sect Leader of the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The assembled cultivators were well-acquainted with the Sect Leader's methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Peak Master Dong Chen disliked direct involvement in the scramble for profits, preferring to maintain a detached neutrality while securing his core interests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Wei Ji's words conveyed Dong Chen's intentions: You can fight over the White Paper Immortal City's profits all you want. But the entire city will ultimately belong to me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">By replacing the city's defensive Formation, he aimed to seize true control of the White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Meng Wuyan's violet eyes flickered briefly before he took a step back, falling silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Seeing the situation resolved, Wei Ji withdrew his gaze and spoke again, his voice echoing through the vast Cloudleap: "Summon Zhong Dao, Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall! Summon him to the formation for deliberation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Zhong Dao's divine sense locked onto the formation, causing the boundary wall to glow. Cloud Qi condensed rapidly, forming a Cloud Body Clone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Zhong Dao Clone slowly materialized before the assembled group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He appeared middle-aged, with deep vertical lines etched between his brows from years of furrowing. His eyes were sharp as blades, radiating undisguised scrutiny and judgment, making it difficult for others to meet his gaze directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">His nose was high and straight as a mountain peak, its lines taut and unyielding. His jawline was sharply defined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Tall and imposing, with broad shoulders and a sturdy frame, he stood as straight as a pine tree. After landing, he strode forward with steady, powerful steps, each carrying an undeniable air of authority and unwavering resolve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">His very presence exuded an aura of unyielding authority, conveying an impression of absolute reliability and uncompromising rigidity, yet also stubbornness and inflexibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"What business summons me here?" Zhong Dao asked, his gaze sweeping across the seven figures before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">His combat prowess, cultivation level, and age surpassed those of the seven present, his only disadvantage being his status as Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall, which ranked slightly lower in the hierarchy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The group remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ling Juejian nodded slightly at Zhong Dao, his expression neutral. Tuo Kuahuang frowned, his eyes fixed on Zhong Dao with wary intensity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Wei Ji cleared his throat and briefly summarized the earlier discussion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"White Paper City? The Yin Mountain Black Marsh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">After hearing Wei Ji's explanation, Zhong Dao understood the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Ha," he chuckled softly. "You summoned me here for this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"As Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall, my duty is to cleanse the palace and purge demonic influences, not to engage in petty scheming or weigh personal gain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">His face hardened, his sharp gaze sweeping across the room. "Wen Ruanyu and Duanmu Zhang? Fellow Sect Members should interact with integrity and sincerity, not be used as pawns!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"As for Qin De, he was originally a Demon Subduing Official imprisoned for execution. How dare you make him a key piece in your game?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"What were you thinking? This is utter nonsense!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">His anger flared as he took a step forward, his voice rising sharply. "The Myriad Manifestations Sect's prestige rests upon righteous methods and boundless Qi! It stands on the shoulders of generations of virtuous predecessors who bore the weight of righteousness, and on the blood and devotion of countless loyal disciples! It cannot be stolen through deceitful means or tarnished by personal gain!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"You expect me to cooperate with this?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Hall Master of the Demon Subjugation Hall, his eyes blazing like stars, turned the question back on the assembled group, his fury threatening to erupt into violence at the slightest provocation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Wei Ji sighed bitterly. "Lord Zhong Dao, please temper your anger. The White Paper Immortal City's location is highly sensitive and its strategic value immense. The slightest misstep could jeopardize the entire sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Such a misstep could implicate the entire sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Our disciples, Meng Yaoyin, Wen Ruanyu, and others, followed the Righteous Path on this mission, failing to uphold our sect's prestige and righteous Qi. Yet precisely because of this, our sect has become entangled in this affair, requiring careful handling."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Zhong Dao snorted coldly, his sharp gaze piercing through the crowd's hypocrisy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He clasped his fists in a formal salute. "To restore White Paper's reputation, we must act with righteous grandeur. I propose we dispatch the Blood Blade of the Demon Subjugation Hall to clear the path, followed by the Sharp Recovery forces from the Three Peaks. As Hall Master, I will personally lead the charge, shattering Yin Mountain and plowing through Black Marsh. Every Great Demon whose crimes are undeniable, every Demon Leader whose wickedness is notorious, shall be bound before the gates of White Paper Immortal City, publicly executed, and their heads displayed as a warning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"This is the true path to righteous grandeur, and it yields immense benefits!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"First, it declares to heaven and earth that we stand irreconcilably opposed to evil!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Second, it terrifies demons, reminding them that their karmic debts must be repaid!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Third, it assures the city's populace that the Immortal Path is not mere empty talk, but possesses the iron will to crush demons and defend righteousness, thereby upholding the people's trust!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Fourth, by purging the Demonic Aura and cleansing the Jade Firmament, we bestow unparalleled grace upon the world! By executing heavenly justice and upholding the righteous Method, we demonstrate unparalleled might! With such grace and might combined, we shall secure White Paper Immortal City and banish all future worries!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The others stared in stunned silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Seeing Zhong Dao's palpable killing intent and his uncompromising hatred for demons, they finally remembered the sect's formidable elder - his past experiences and unwavering principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Wei Ji and the others regretted their decision. "How could we have been so foolish as to summon Zhong Dao for this discussion? Given his unwavering hatred of evil, he's bound to act according to his own strong will."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">They exchanged glances and communicated through divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Zhong Dao and Duanmu Zhang are the most stubborn and politically astute figures in the entire sect. Alas, how did the White Paper Immortal City affair drag both of them into this mess?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">A collective headache descended upon them. Meng Wuyan, however, wore a faint smile, as if anticipating a good show.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Meanwhile, in a branch of the Demon Subjugation Hall, the Rising Cloud Trial was underway within a spatial formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">On a stone platform, Ning Zhuo stood before a miniature replica of a government office, its plaque inscribed with "Bright Mirror Hanging High." He faced an elderly cultivator who posed a series of questions:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Suppose you capture a demon or subdue a fiend. If they beg for mercy, offer substantial rewards, or pledge to serve as your slave, how would you handle the situation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The elderly cultivator's methods could detect genuine sincerity, but he inadvertently triggered the Buddha Heart Demon Seal within Ning Zhuo's Upper Dantian in his divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Precious Seal radiated demonic light, granting Ning Zhuo vast room to maneuver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">His thoughts raced like lightning as he recalled all the information he had gathered about Zhong Dao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">In the next instant, his posture straightened like a pine tree, his eyes remained utterly calm, and his voice rang out like the clash of metal, cold and clear:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Root out evil completely, show no mercy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"To let it linger is to invite future calamity, to defile the righteous Qi of heaven and earth. When the blade must fall, let it fall! When execution is due, let it be done! The Ba Demon's head serves but one purpose: to be displayed atop High Bamboo as a warning to all! Let the world's rulers tremble at the sight!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">As he spoke, an invisible aura of chilling, murderous intent spread through the air, as if the clang of swords echoed in the void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">On the stone platform, the high-ranking cultivators of the Demon Subjugation Hall listened, their eyes gleaming with fervor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The elder cultivator's admiration for Ning Zhuo deepened. He praised inwardly, "Excellent! 'Root out evil completely' - truly a promising seedling of the Righteous Path!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Unbeknownst to the assembled cultivators, coiled around Ning Zhuo's waist within the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon, Lady Spiderweb - who should have been "rooted out completely" - hummed contentedly as she constructed a Formation for him.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
