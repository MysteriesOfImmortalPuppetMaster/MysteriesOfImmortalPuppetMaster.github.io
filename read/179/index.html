<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">As the two sides faced off, on the verge of clashing, Zheng Hua hurriedly intervened, "Everyone, calm down!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"The real battle hasn't even started, and we're already fighting amongst ourselves."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Such behavior would tarnish the Ning family's reputation," Zhou Zeshen and others echoed in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Under the persuasion of the crowd, Ning Zhuo, Ning Xiaohui, and the mysterious Snow Soul finally restrained their qi and temporarily ceased their confrontation.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">When they sat down again, Ning Xiaohui and Ning Zhuo were already far apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Tong Zetuo smiled and cupped his hands towards the mysterious Snow Soul, "May I ask for the esteemed senior's name?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The mysterious Snow Soul, exuding a Foundation Establishment aura, replied proudly, "I am Ning Xie. In life, I was an elder of the Ning family, possessing the Heavenly Talent Snow Soul Ice Spirit. After dying in battle, I became a ghost cultivator. This time, I have come out of seclusion for our joint operation."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Zhou Zeshen was puzzled, "Senior, as a Foundation Establishment ghost cultivator, how can you enter the Immortal Palace?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ghost cultivator Ning Xie explained, "It's not difficult. I can attach myself to Xiaohui's soul, temporarily merging with her."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"When Ning Xiaohui's soul enters the Immortal Palace, I can be brought in as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"However, if I reveal myself to fight, I can only exist for thirteen breaths. Beyond that, I will be expelled by the Lava Immortal Palace."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Zheng Jian spoke up, confirming from the side, "We have already verified this situation." He was indeed an insider.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Zhou Zeshen's gaze darkened slightly.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He keenly sensed that the Ning and Zheng families seemed closer than he had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">On the surface, Zhou Zeshen cupped his hands, his face showing joy, "With senior's assistance, using the Heavenly Talent Snow Soul Ice Spirit, our chances of victory greatly increase."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Xie snorted coldly, "Naturally."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo also snorted coldly, "Only thirteen breaths of time, what can you do? Freeze the entire checkpoint?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Xie squinted his eyes, his expression extremely cold, "You are right, I can freeze the surroundings and alter the battlefield. If you don't believe me, you'll get a taste of it!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo laughed, "Freeze our own people? You died, and your brain died with you?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Can you freeze that mechanical ape and the puppet slaves?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Oh, right."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"If you get enslaved by the puppets, it would be hilarious!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Shut up!" Ning Xie cursed angrily, "Brat, sharp-tongued! If you keep yapping, I'll tear your mouth apart."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo's face turned serious, his gaze darkened, "Who is yapping with you?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"What I pointed out is the biggest hidden danger! I'm considering the overall situation, and you think I'm just yapping with you?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo pointed at Ning Xie, "My concern is straightforward, can this ghost cultivator be brought in?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Don't let him become a weapon against us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Xie trembled with anger, his entire soul turning paler.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Just as he was about to speak, an elderly voice came, "On this point, I can vouch for it."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Everyone's expressions changed.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Xie immediately shut his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Then, the Ning family patriarch walked in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He stared at Ning Zhuo, smiling coldly, "Ning Zhuo, you are very thorough in your considerations."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"But you are still too young to understand the mysteries of ghost cultivation and the foundation of the Ning family!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands, his gaze calm, fearlessly meeting the patriarch's eyes, "If that's the case, I can only remain skeptical."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Then, he changed his tone, "But I still do not recommend acting so hastily."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"We currently lack reliable intelligence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"We can wait for the spell to be improved and use the improved spell for reconnaissance."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"After all, the opponents are just two mechanical war puppets. Once we know their details, their chances of winning are very low."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhou Zeshen inwardly applauded.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He didn't expect Ning Zhuo to be so tough! He directly confronted the Ning family's Foundation Establishment elder, even the patriarch.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"How much cultivation does he have? Only the third layer of Qi Refining. Truly courageous!" Zhou Zeshen even felt a slight admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu felt the same.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zheng Hua thought, "Ning Zhuo is young and impetuous, daring to confront his own patriarch publicly."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"However, considering his actions, it is understandable."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Now that he has become the master of the black market, his power has greatly increased, achieving unprecedented success. He is in a period of expansion."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"If I were him, I would be even more arrogant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"If this continues, the Ning family will have a second internal war. We can provide significant support!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Hearing Ning Zhuo's suggestion to continue reconnaissance, Zhou Zeshen thought for a moment and agreed, "Forgive my rudeness, but I also think continued reconnaissance is better."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Intelligence is crucial! Especially for our kind of battle, more intelligence can greatly affect the outcome."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Hmm? Zhou Zeshen is so openly siding with Ning Zhuo?" Zheng Jian was also surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the four major forces were in constant competition, forming a complex web of relationships.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Outstanding family members were very sensitive to the relationships between families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Zheng Jian thought for a moment and spoke, "Indeed, we started improving reconnaissance spells long ago."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"But it will take some time to complete."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"In fact, our family has been purchasing and borrowing related enlightenment diagrams."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"However, even with enlightenment diagrams, it depends on the cultivator's comprehension. Those with average comprehension gain little from them."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo spread his hands, "Then we can wait."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"I believe our reformation team is full of talent. Someone will comprehend it, or we can wait until the three families improve the spell. Once we have the reconnaissance results, we can attack with confidence!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Speaking of enlightenment diagrams, I have two. Maybe I can share them with everyone."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Shut up!" Ning Xiaohui almost jumped, "The enlightenment diagrams are lent to you by the family for personal use. How can you share them with outsiders?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ghost cultivator Ning Xie also said, "Ning family branch junior, do you know nothing of family law? You have no right to distribute these diagrams."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo laughed, "I was just making a suggestion. The patriarch is here, what do you say?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Ning family patriarch felt extremely uncomfortable, as if he had swallowed a fly.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">As the head of the family, he couldn't openly oppose Ning Xiaohui.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Facing members of the Zheng and Zhou families, under the alliance of the three families, he couldn't outright refuse.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">This situation put him in a difficult position, thanks to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">For the first time, the Ning family patriarch regretted his hasty appearance, feeling he had acted without enough consideration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhou Zeshen suddenly laughed, "If the Ning family is willing to share two enlightenment diagrams, I propose our family also share two diagrams with the reformation team."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Zheng Jian was about to speak when Zheng Hua stepped in, "Good! I can immediately offer our family's Flame Peak Steaming Cloud Diagram and Earth Furnace Spouting Fire Diagram for everyone to study."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Ning family patriarch laughed, "Sharing enlightenment diagrams is no problem for the Ning family."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"But even if we comprehend something, it requires extensive practice and is difficult to use in battle."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"It's better to focus on special training, developing coordination and tacit understanding, which is more useful than comprehending spells."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"This battle must be fought quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"The specifics can't be disclosed, but I can tell you it concerns the Golden Core ancestors of our three families."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Everyone was shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Ning family patriarch was warning them: don't just consider the battle itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">There are powerful external factors forcing a quick resolution!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The battle is just a tool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"The battle isn't the goal, so what is the real goal?" Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He deliberately provoked others to gather more intelligence.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Since his conflict with the Ning family's main branch was irreconcilable, he didn't care about superficial harmony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The gains were substantial.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He not only gathered a lot of intelligence but also gained the opportunity to study four new enlightenment diagrams!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The Ning family patriarch's revelation about the Golden Core was also good news for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo often read historical records, seeing cases where kings or ministers, ignoring the actual situation, commanded armies recklessly, leading to disastrous defeats.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Initially, he thought these people were foolish.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">But as he grew older, especially in recent days, he deeply felt human limitations and better understood their "foolishness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Is it foolishness?  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">It's foolishness, wisdom, and helplessness.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Everyone has their own pressures and motivations, desires and fears.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">These factors intertwine, making pure battles impure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Just as Ning Zhuo needed Yuan Dasheng to win small victories, not big victories or defeats, the three families' hasty action stemmed from the Golden Core ancestors' mysterious decisions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Reading as a youth, I laughed at the mundane.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Reading again, I am now a character in the book.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The world within the book is beyond one's control, but the vastness of it is cherished!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Zhou Zeshen sighed, "It seems we have no choice but to proceed."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo looked at Zheng Hua, "Since it's the will of the three Golden Core ancestors, Ning Xie must be involved."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"If the Ning family is like this, the Zheng and Zhou families must also have some cards to play?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Zheng Hua laughed, "I was just about to say."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"An ancestor of our family once stumbled into the Ghost Market, losing half his life but gaining something."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"This technique is called the Ghost Martial Divine Soldier Tempering Method. It consumes soul power to cut part of the soul, creating ghostly weapons."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Once mastered, you essentially have a half-life weapon. When the soul enters the Immortal Palace, you can obtain corresponding mechanical parts in the first room."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Everyone looked at Zheng Jian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Zheng Jian had a hook-shaped magical artifact floating beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">When his soul entered the Immortal Palace, he also had corresponding wooden hook parts floating around him.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Zheng Jian quickly explained, "This is not a ghost weapon."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
