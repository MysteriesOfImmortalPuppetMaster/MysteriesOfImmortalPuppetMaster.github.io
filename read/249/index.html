<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 249: After Years of Struggle, Finally Arriving Here!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">This is a world of orange-red hues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The air is hot, and even standing still, one would naturally break into a sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo tidied up his bedding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">After setting up some talismans around the room, he pushed open the door and stepped out of his temporary residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Together with members of the three reformation teams, he entered the Lava Immortal Palace, bringing ample supplies for a long-term stay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo left the house allocated to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In the small courtyard, several cultivators from the Ning family were cleaning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, they all greeted him with respect and admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Through his hard work over the past months and various actions, Ning Zhuo's prestige within the Ning family reformation team had reached its peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo smiled at them, nodded, and then, with seemingly slow but actually swift steps, left the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">According to recent orders, he needed to head to a secluded area to meet Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">As he walked, he looked up slightly, gazing into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The sky was covered by a massive spherical light shield, glowing a faint golden color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">From Ning Zhuo's perspective, he could vaguely see beyond the shield: a dense, endless tide of demon beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Various types and sizes of demon beasts were frantically attacking the formation shield of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The shield was not absolutely secure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In some places, where the attacks reached their limit, cracks appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Through these visible cracks, flames seeped in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Immediately, the flames reformed in mid-air, creating a Void Traversing Technique-level Fire Snake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Fire Snake hissed as it fell, but before it could hit the ground, a large group of mechanical constructs met it in mid-air, engaging in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">By the time the Fire Snake hit the ground, it had suffered significant damage, barely clinging to life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Then, it was completely overwhelmed by more mechanical constructs on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Such scenes did not reassure Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">On the contrary, he had already sensed the declining defensive power of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">His recent bombardment had provoked an enormous tide of demon beasts! The Lava Immortal Palace was at a disadvantage, and the situation was worsening over time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Brother Sun's entry into the Immortal Palace is highly risky. I wonder how he managed to get in." "Did he rely on the Golden Core true disciple Yang Chanyu of the Void Sect again?" Thinking of Yang Chanyu, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel more worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Previously, when Sun Lingtong went to steal goods from the Cloud Merchant, he once again teamed up with Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Yang Chanyu's repeated assistance was quite troubling in Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He raised his estimation of the price Sun Lingtong would have to pay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Next, I need to find an opportunity to secretly meet with Brother Sun and hand over the Supreme Virtuous Water!" "Then see if I can subtly inquire from Yang Chanyu about the specific price Brother Sun has to pay for this cooperation." "That Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud, Brother Sun is unwilling to give it to Yang Chanyu. I'll use it as a gift to see if I can get some information from her, and secretly help Brother Sun bear some pressure." Walking through the streets of the Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo was gradually drawn in by the scenery along the way, putting aside his thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">This was his first time truly walking within the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Countless times, he had imagined this scene in his plans...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Today, it was finally realized! In the Lava Immortal Palace, everywhere he looked, there were golden pillars and red bricks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Under the firelight reflected by the surrounding magma, the golden pillars and red bricks shimmered with a dazzling glow, like an eternal immortal light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Towering towers, majestic halls, and exquisite side halls were all laid out clearly and reasonably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The solid architectural structure gave the Lava Immortal Palace a robust and ancient feel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The statues of fire dragons and fire phoenixes were intricately carved and lifelike, adding a sense of grandeur.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Although the two architectural styles were contrasting, they blended harmoniously here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ahead of Ning Zhuo, a wall gradually appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The wall was quite thick, and at intervals, large talisman patterns were drawn on it, resembling painted windows. "This is the Spirit-Hiding Wall," Ning Zhuo thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He reached out his hand, walking while touching the uneven wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The tactile sensation transmitted to his fingertips was so clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">This was a profound feeling he hadn't experienced when his soul entered the Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His eyes gradually reddened, and he couldn't help but think of his deceased mother. "Mother, I have finally reached the Lava Immortal Palace at this moment." Ning Zhuo had longed for this moment for over a decade, planning for it for just as long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Once he decided to bomb the Immortal Palace and took action, there was no turning back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Reaching this point was not easy for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He had exhausted his mind and energy, faced numerous life-and-death crises, and only then could he walk this path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">With only Qi Refining Stage cultivation, he had to navigate among the four major forces of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, enduring the immense pressure brought by Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">During this time, he used various means to survive each crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sometimes, he relied on over a decade of preparation, and sometimes he depended on luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">In this process, any slight mistake could lead to his death without a burial place! Many who explored the Immortal Palace only began to fight for their lives when facing the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">But Ning Zhuo had already placed his life on the line from the very beginning. "If possible, I wouldn't want to do this," Ning Zhuo once again looked at the faint golden spherical shield in the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He watched the dense tide of demon beasts outside the shield: "I have no choice, forced by circumstances, I had to overturn the table."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Of course, he controlled the intensity, not completely overturning the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This time, he used the demon beasts to create a situation where everyone had to give their all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">In this way, he could alleviate much of the pressure on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Once Ning Zhuo achieved this step, the entire situation became irreversible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">For the Lava Immortal Palace and for him, it was the same!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He was like a fledgling bird on the edge of a cliff, spreading its wings for the first time, either soaring to the sky or falling to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Following the wide street, Ning Zhuo finally arrived at a side hall. "Here." The people inside the side hall turned their heads upon hearing the knock on the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Zhu Xuanji spoke, "Come in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The next moment, Ning Zhuo pushed open the door and entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The side hall was already occupied, and Ning Zhuo was the last to arrive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Besides Zhu Xuanji, there were Zheng Jian, Zhou Zeshen, and Zhou Zhu. "Divine Constable," the white-clad youth Ning Zhuo first saluted Zhu Xuanji, then apologized to the others, "Sorry, I'm late." The geniuses from the Zhou and Zheng families all smiled at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"We haven't been here long." "You're not late; the timing is just right." By now, Ning Zhuo had not only gained immense prestige within the Ning family but also earned the admiration of the genius cultivators from the other two families through his actions and achievements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Even the Golden Core Stage Zhu Xuanji regarded Ning Zhuo with newfound respect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo discreetly glanced at the heads of the three genius cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He noticed that during their time apart, the Life Hanging by a Threads above their heads had grown thicker and more solid. "It seems their recognition of me is deepening." Ning Zhuo looked at Zhu Xuanji and sighed inwardly, "If only I could plant the Life Hanging by a Thread on his head, my advantage would be significant." Unfortunately, with his current cultivation, even possessing the complete Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, he couldn't achieve that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Perhaps, when I advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage, I might be able to plant the Life Hanging by a Thread on a Golden Core cultivator's head," Ning Zhuo speculated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Zhu Xuanji was straightforward: "Now that everyone is here, let's sign the contract first." He briefly explained the contract's contents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu had no objections, but Zhou Zeshen and Ning Zhuo both frowned slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Zhou Zeshen was doubtful but didn't dare to question directly, so he looked at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">As expected, Ning Zhuo cupped his hands, "Divine Constable, please wait a moment, I have some concerns." "If it's just to restrain our three families and the City Lord's reformation team members... this indeed achieves fairness, allowing us to focus all our energy and time on competing for various positions in the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"But besides our four parties' reformation team members, many others are also soul-entering the Immortal Palace, competing for its treasures." "What about these people?" "What if a buried genius emerges among them, quickly rising due to this inheritance, and ultimately surpassing our achievements? What should we do then?" "If our four parties' reformation team members can't soul-enter the Immortal Palace, wouldn't that leave an opportunity for such individuals?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"So I believe we should at least leave some people to monitor the trials in the Lava Immortal Palace, to prevent such dark horses from appearing." Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly, "We've already considered these situations." As he spoke, he took out a scroll.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Clearly, it was a decree scroll.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Zhu Xuanji handed it to Ning Zhuo first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo unfolded it and found that the decree scroll contained extensive content.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The text detailed the various terms of the four-party contract, perfectly addressing Ning Zhuo's concerns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Each party would send a reformation team member to station at the trial checkpoints in the Lava Immortal Palace, recording and monitoring the exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace by the city's residents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">If a dark horse appeared, the four forces would promptly intervene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The decree scroll also specified the contract's duration and how to handle various unexpected situations that might arise during the period.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
