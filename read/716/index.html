<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 716: Crafting the Bamboo Puppet and Obtaining Azure Wind</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Inside the Mechanical Dragon, Ning Zhuo had been working tirelessly at the Mechanism Platform for nearly half a day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He only needed to craft one final type of Vowel Reed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">According to the Primordial Reed Book, this was the "Shadow Bee Needle." When activated, it would emit an extremely brief "yi" sound, granting the Mechanical Carrier a sudden burst of speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">All the necessary materials were laid out on the table: Thunderstruck Jade Bamboo, its color like frozen fat and veined with lightning patterns; Golden-Ringed Venom Bees, their abdomens containing fiery threads and wings shimmering with golden light; North Ice Crystal Sand, its touch as cold as stardust; and Vernal Equinox Rootless Water, stored in an Azure Jade Lotus Leaf Cup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo activated the Mechanism Platform, unleashing a sharp golden beam that split the Jade Bamboo lengthwise along its natural lightning patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Instantly, the hollow interior was revealed, its walls spiraling upward and covered in intricate lightning patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but recall the Primordial Reed Book's description: "Lightning patterns guide Qi, carved by heaven and earth with thunder as their blade, forming the sonic tracks of primordial melodies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He retrieved the North Ice Crystal Sand and poured it all into the Azure Jade Lotus Leaf Cup, thoroughly mixing it with the Vernal Equinox Rootless Water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Following the detailed instructions in the Primordial Reed Book, Ning Zhuo channeled his Five Elements Spiritual Power to facilitate the mixing process. He alternated between the Fire, Water, and Earth Elements, demonstrating the broad applicability of this fundamental energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ultimately, Ning Zhuo obtained a translucent, slightly greenish paste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He carefully filled the Jade Bamboo wall with this paste, leaving only the final cavity empty to serve as the vibration source chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"The natural sonic pathways carved by lightning within the bamboo have saved me considerable manual labor," Ning Zhuo mused, secretly admiring Qing Huangzi's ingenious material selection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Next, he turned his attention to the Golden-Ringed Venom Bee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">As soon as the restraints were released, the bee buzzed into flight, its stinger aimed directly at Ning Zhuo's forehead!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Without flinching, Ning Zhuo channeled a surge of Wood Element spiritual energy to intercept the bee.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The stinger pierced three inches into the Wood Element energy before suddenly bursting into Poison Fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Poison Fire intertwined with Azure Qi, and the bee's body rapidly disintegrated into ash, leaving only its venom-coated sonic needle hovering in mid-air, humming ominously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Racing against time while the Poison Fire still burned, Ning Zhuo immediately proceeded to the next step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Using the bee's needle as a stylus and the Poison Fire as ink, he pierced the ice-sand paste three millimeters deep before withdrawing. He repeated this process, creating a series of fine perforations along the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Where the ice and fire clashed, a hissing sound arose, each hole varying in depth and angle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The first hole was as wide as a grain of wheat. The seven holes in the middle section were as fine as needle tips, while the final hole pierced the cavity wall at an angle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Poison Fire had already been extinguished by the ice paste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo inserted the Shadow Bee Needle into the final cavity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He bit his fingertip, letting a drop of blood fall into the cavity while channeling his spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">A buzzing sound erupted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo flipped his palm, pressing the two halves of the bamboo joint tightly together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The buzzing was forcibly suppressed within the cavity, reflecting repeatedly through the eight sound holes. When the ninth echo overlapped, the buzzing suddenly clarified into a single, short note, followed by complete silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Under Ning Zhuo's blood refinement, the Jade Bamboo fused back into a seamless whole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He held the warm, jade-like bamboo in his palm, noticing a faint golden needlepoint emerging from its tip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo stroked the bamboo joint, then casually tossed it into the air. The joint spun in mid-air, emitting a series of short, staccato sounds: "Yi-Yi-Yi-Yi-..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The bamboo joint's speed surged, becoming almost a blur.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo reached out and caught it again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The lingering sound vanished instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"With this, all twenty components of the Vowel Reed Mechanism are now complete."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Next, it's time to create the Bamboo Puppets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">According to the information Qing Huangzi had disseminated, the prerequisite for participating in the second Rising Cloud Minor Trial was for cultivators to bring their own crafted Bamboo Puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"But Qing Huangzi didn't specify the number of these puppets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Perhaps this is a deliberate test of the participating cultivators' ability to design mechanisms and analyze situations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">There were two extreme approaches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The first extreme was to concentrate all the Vowel Reed components into a single, massive Bamboo Puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The second extreme was to craft each Vowel Reed component into a separate Little Bamboo Puppet. When assembled, these puppets would form a small combat team of twenty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo didn't hesitate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Since I don't know the exact circumstances of the second Rising Cloud Minor Trial, a balanced approach is best."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He decided to follow his inspiration and create seven Little Bamboo Puppets, each equipped with an average of three Vowel Reeds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo stood before the Mechanism Platform, motionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Soon, the time it takes to brew a cup of tea had passed, and Ning Zhuo had completed his first Little Bamboo Puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The third reed was meticulously crafted into the handle of a bamboo whip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">For the whip's body, Ning Zhuo used Ice Silkworm Crystal Silk, weaving it with the aid of his divine sense. The whip's surface was etched with numerous grooves, designed to generate sound through air friction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Spiritual Energy Thread Suspension!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo extended his five fingers to manipulate the whip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Crack! The Little Bamboo Puppet snapped the whip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The air rapidly swirled into a vortex, a brief whoosh echoing in his ears. The sound traveled down the whip's length, amplified tenfold within the hollow handle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">From there, the vibrations coursed through the puppet's arm, reaching its torso and activating the remaining two Vowel Reed components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In the next instant, a semi-transparent sonic web erupted from the puppet's body, expanding outward to cover a ten-foot radius.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This sonic web, imbued with triple-layered power, was the Little Bamboo Puppet's trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo placed a piece of Profound Iron within the sonic web to test its effects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">First, the iron's descent slowed dramatically, almost halting mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Then, countless fissures crisscrossed its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Finally, the iron vibrated violently before exploding with a resounding bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Over the next two days, Ning Zhuo completed all seven Little Bamboo Puppets, meeting Qing Huangzi's initial requirements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Now comes the constant practice," he muttered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo trained for another full day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">His extensive experience in manipulation allowed him to master the seven puppets quickly, achieving proficiency in no time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Based on my studies, I can already anticipate one aspect of Qing Huangzi's Minor Trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"His method of controlling the Bamboo Puppets relies primarily on musical rhythm, with Magic Thread Suspension as a secondary technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"To avoid being caught unprepared, I should focus on mastering musical rhythm now. Only through diligent practice can I achieve true proficiency."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Thunder Sound Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Mute Pool nestled atop the mountain peak, resembling a shattered piece of ink-jade mirror dropped by a careless deity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The pool's edge was ringed with jagged, thunderstruck rocks. Many of the dark stones had been tempered by Heavenly Fire, their surfaces now gleaming with a glazed sheen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The pool's surface remained perpetually still, reflecting the drifting clouds and the twinkling stars, yet it swallowed all sound. Even when massive boulders crashed into its depths, only a silent ripple spread across the surface before vanishing into the abyss, as if falling into a bottomless Lake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">At the pool's center stood a small sandbar, upon which grew a solitary Gu Qitong tree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Its trunk, barely three spans in circumference, twisted like a dying dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Resin, amber-like tears, oozed from every fissure in its bark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The leafless tree's dense, gnarled branches formed a hollow nest within their tangled embrace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">In ordinary times, the pool lay deathly still. Mountain winds, colliding with the branches and hollow nest, were shredded into wisps by the tree's sharp, solitary aura. Frequent lightning strikes shattered into weeping gusts of Qi, while lingering Heavenly Fire tempered the surrounding rocks, creating a lonely spectacle of silent fireworks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Only during the Flying Cloud Assembly did this place come alive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Formation on Thunderstrike Peak would activate, shielding the area from the descending thunderbolts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">A large number of cultivators had gathered by the Mute Pool, eagerly awaiting Gu Qitong's Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">As Ning Zhuo arrived, Gu Qitong stirred slightly in the wind, preparing to begin transmitting the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The assembled cultivators sat cross-legged or stood around the pool, poised and ready.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo immediately found an empty spot and settled onto a stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">At first, he went unnoticed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">But when he pulled out a hemp rope and a wooden awl, he drew attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Hang one's head from the rafters, prick one's thigh with an awl!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo tied his hair to the rope and simultaneously stabbed his thigh with the awl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Is this a Confucian cultivator's technique?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Using Confucian cultivation methods before it's even started?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Indeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo had decided to inflict pain on himself first, to sharpen his focus and enter the proper state of mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Gu Qitong began to emit sound, performing the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual for all to hear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Hanging his head from the rafters cleared Ning Zhuo's mind of distractions, while the awl's piercing pain brought him penetrating clarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He poured his entire being into listening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He heard the sound of trees growing and joints expanding, his entire body bathed in the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual, experiencing a subtle, tingling sensation of growth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo marveled inwardly, "This is what it means to grow!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">During the first iteration, he gained a comprehensive but superficial understanding of the entire Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">By the second iteration, the hemp rope had tightened around his scalp, causing a constant, dull ache. His right thigh was already mangled beyond recognition, forcing him to switch to his left leg.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The wooden awl plunged down repeatedly, each strike delivered without the slightest hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Some observers watching Ning Zhuo's ordeal couldn't help but twitch at the corner of their eyes, inwardly marveling, "How can this hulking youth be so merciless toward himself?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The earlier sounds of growth and sprouting now seemed amplified, revealing countless intricate details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">These were distinct rhythms and tempos of growth, each note audible to Ning Zhuo's ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"The Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual uses musical principles to awaken the innate vitality of trees, granting them power and accelerating their growth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">By the third repetition, a small pool of blood had formed beneath Ning Zhuo's feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The excruciating pain at his scalp had begun to numb. Large clumps of hair were being torn out by the hemp rope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo's vision blurred, his upper body swaying uncontrollably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">As he listened, all the sounds merged into a cacophony - a torrential downpour, croaking frogs, and thunderous drums - a chaotic symphony that left him dizzy and disoriented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Trying to swallow too much at once!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"I wanted to achieve perfection in one step, but my mastery falls short."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Luoshu Page!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">His vision swimming, Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity presented by his position at the edge of the crowd. Summoning his Divine Art, he secretly channeled the power of the Dao Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Under the influence of the Luoshu Page, Ning Zhuo's mind instantly became remarkably organized. The sounds he heard were immediately categorized by source, sequence, and volume, no longer a chaotic jumble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Moreover, the various sounds of growth and sprouting coalesced into a natural, free-flowing melody, unfolding in Ning Zhuo's ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">In that moment, Ning Zhuo was entranced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He heard the pulse of life itself, flowing and surging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Through this, he grasped the core essence of the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Mastered in just three repetitions!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo retrieved his hemp rope and wooden stake, healed his injuries, and quietly left the scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">According to the established pattern, Gu Qitong would perform the same musical score at least twenty times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Though some noticed his movements and glanced at him, seeing his pale face, bloodstained clothes, and disheveled appearance - looking defeated and disheveled - they dismissed him as a failure and paid him no further attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Gu Qitong was originally a Demon Cultivator who had devoted his life to saving his Dao Companion, his soulmate. He had defied fate, only to fail in the face of divine retribution, watching helplessly as his beloved perished in the thunderous Calamity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Severely wounded in body and spirit, Gu Qitong's cultivation was nearly shattered. He reverted to his true form - a Phoenix Tree - and in the Calamity-scarred ruins, he endlessly performed different musical scores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">This was a rather unique participant in the Myriad Manifestations Sect's Soaring Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">If a cultivator could respond to Gu Qitong's mournful melodies with a high-quality musical piece, they might receive Amber Tree Tears from the Phoenix Tree as a reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"I'll pass on this spectacle!" Ning Zhuo had already mastered the technique but chose to remain reserved, unwilling to show off unnecessarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He secretly rejoiced, "Among all the musical scores, the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual is the most suitable for the Bamboo Puppet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"Though I've mastered it, I still need to practice this manual."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"In the future, I might even be able to control an entire Bamboo Puppet army using the Azure Wind Spring Rain Manual."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">As Ning Zhuo considered this, he couldn't help but marvel again at how wonderful the Flying Cloud Assembly and Rising Cloud Minor Trial were. Here, one could freely learn all sorts of things without worrying about external factors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Hmm, what's this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">While riding his cloud past a mountain peak, Ning Zhuo unexpectedly discovered a group of cultivators gathered, discussing the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"There's a trial involving a Mechanism here. Why not give it a try?" Ning Zhuo's interest was immediately piqued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">With his newly acquired techniques - the "Head-Hanging, Thigh-Stabbing" method, the "Meaning-Conveying Brush," the "Bitter Ink," and the Luoshu Page - Ning Zhuo now possessed a comprehensive learning system that fueled his curiosity and drive to master all sorts of skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">A minor trial! Moreover, this one before him was a Rising Cloud Trial for mechanism arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Ning Zhuo descended his cloud, arriving at the mountainside to compete with the other cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The stone gate at the mountainside opened, revealing a burly man with a massive black beard that nearly encircled his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The bearded giant grinned, revealing a set of stark white teeth. "I am Che Zhuzi," he boomed. "Come in, everyone!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Che Zhuzi, do you stand by your word?" someone immediately asked. "Will whoever passes your Rising Cloud Minor Trial truly receive a magic treasure or another item of equal value?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Che Zhuzi nodded emphatically. "Of course, of course! My word is my bond - absolutely!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Then I'll go first!" The cultivator who had asked the question stepped forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The other cultivators, now fully roused, surged forward, scrambling to enter the gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Ning Zhuo chuckled inwardly. This hired shill is a bit rough around the edges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">But he was wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">This wasn't a shill at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Deep within the cave, Lady Spiderweb trembled with anticipation. He's here. That little brat Ning Zhuo has finally taken the bait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">All my efforts to have Che Zhuzi spread the word and offer generous rewards to entice cultivators to participate in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial have paid off!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"Come on, hurry in!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Lady Spiderweb licked her crimson lips, her eyes gleaming with malice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
