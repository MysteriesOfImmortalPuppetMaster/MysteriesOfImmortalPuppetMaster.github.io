<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">â€œAncient Spirit Plants,  Rare Flowers of the Immortal Garden, Tales of Spiritual Essences"...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo carefully skimmed through these books, his brow furrowing. These texts were not just simple introductions to rare herbs but complex manuals on cultivating spiritual plants. They delved deep into the planting, pruning, nurturing, and propagation of various exotic plants.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Some of the rare herbs were so scarce that even the authors of these books lacked hands-on experience. However, through solid theoretical groundwork, they managed to push their understanding to great depths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">For Ning Zhuo, these contents were overwhelmingly advanced. He could see the clear explanations in the books, yet when it came to practical application, after just a few steps of deduction, he found himself lost in confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo understood why.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"The knowledge taught at the family academy was indeed basicâ€”very basic."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">"What I'm reading now is at a very high level. There's an important transitional gap in knowledge, which makes it difficult for me to fully grasp."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">Fortunately, among these records was a method for cultivating the Spirit Concealing Willow. Although one of the books didnâ€™t specifically cover it, it mentioned similar plants that provided some enlightening insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">Of course Ning Zhuo wouldnâ€™t follow the book rigidly. After all, the soil and water, among other things, would still need to be bought from the Ten Thousand Medicine Valley. Should anyone piece together what he was purchasing, especially a skilled cultivator from the Myriad Medicine Sect, it would be easy for them to guess he was cultivating the Spirit Concealing Willow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">Although he couldnâ€™t understand the theory behind the methods, Ning Zhuo was still able to compare several cultivation plans, combining them and making slight improvements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">Immersing himself in the world of these books, he spent several hours and finally came up with a final plan. He showed it to Sun Lingtong, who couldnâ€™t point out any mistakes either, since he was also an outsider in the field of plants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">"To be on the safe side, letâ€™s use the Spirit Concealing Willow to perfect the final plan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">Ning Zhuo was worried about making a small mistake that could lead to significant consequences. He first mixed a jar of spiritual water, then entered the storage cabin to retrieve the Spirit Concealing Willow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">He placed the Spirit Concealing Willow in a large jar, fully submerging its roots in the spirit-rich water. This method, which he learned from the records, was an emergency technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">Standing under the tree, Ning Zhuo patted its thick and sturdy trunk, saying:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Spirit Concealing Willow, Spirit Concealing Willow, I donâ€™t want to use you this way, but these texts are too difficult to understand. I fear the cultivation method I improved might harm you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"So, I have to borrow your power to check it over for me."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">"Iâ€™m doing this for your sake, too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">As Ning Zhuo sighed, the Spirit Concealing Willowâ€™s branches moved in the windless air, gently brushing against his face. The young man in white looked up at the towering tree and smiled in relief:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"I see, you want a safe environment too, right? Then letâ€™s begin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">With that, Ning Zhuo sat down again under the tree, took out his improved plan along with various manuals, and began contemplating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Leaves detached from the tree branches, scattering around him, releasing soft, jade-like light that made Ning Zhuo appear ethereal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Meanwhile, on the training ground at Yuanshan Mountain:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Lin Shanshan moved as lightly as a swallow, launching an attack toward Ning Zhuo. Her palms waved gracefully, the wind from her hands swift and unpredictable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuoâ€™s eyes focused as he stepped forward, his body flowing like a dragon as he easily dodged her attacks. He moved to her side, his fists shaking as he aimed a powerful punch at her waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Seeing this, Lin Shanshan spun around, evading his strike. Both her palms shot out, and for a moment, her hand shadows danced like waves, surging toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Unfazed, Ning Zhuo crossed his hands, using softness to counter her strength, defending himself steadily. As Lin Shanshanâ€™s breath became shallow, Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity, stepping forward and striking with his fist, sending her flying back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He didnâ€™t relent and pressed the attack, his fierce offensive forcing Lin Shanshan to retreat. Ning Zhuoâ€™s energy was vigorous, his stamina abundant. Spotting a flaw in her defense, he directly shoulder-charged her. Despite her hands being crossed in front of her chest to block, the immense force broke through her defense, forcing her back several steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">If this had been a real battle, Ning Zhuo would have pursued and severely injured her. But since this was just a spar, he withdrew his strike upon seeing her vulnerability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Miss Lin, are you alright?" he asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Lin Shanshan, slightly out of breath, was sweating lightly but felt pleased. Looking at Ning Zhuo with bright eyes, she said:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">"Ning Zhuo, your progress is obvious. I remember when we first sparred, you were always on the defensive and full of openings."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Now, youâ€™ve turned defense into offense. Your attacks are continuous, and even I struggle to keep up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo smiled:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">"Itâ€™s all thanks to you, Miss Lin. Sparring with you has given me a lot of insights into martial arts. After absorbing and learning, the improvements are indeed noticeable."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"However, lately, Iâ€™ve felt that Iâ€™m gaining fewer insights from martial arts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Lin Shanshan nodded:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">"Thatâ€™s normal."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"First, martial cultivation becomes harder the further you go. Youâ€™ve already reached a certain height."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">"Second, since youâ€™ve been sparring with me so much, youâ€™re familiar with my style. Youâ€™ve become adept at handling my moves. To develop solid martial skills, you need to spar with different opponents once youâ€™ve established a good foundation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Ning Zhuoâ€™s face lit up with understanding.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"I see. So, I need to spar with others to regain that feeling of improvement. But who should I spar with?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He looked at Lin Shanshan.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">"Do you have anyone to recommend?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Who is the best close-combat fighter in the Myriad Medicine Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Without hesitation, Lin Shanshan replied:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">"That would be Senior Brother."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"His swordsmanship is extraordinary. With your current strength, you wouldnâ€™t last more than three rounds."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">"But itâ€™s not convenient for you to meet him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">The two continued chatting while resting.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">"By the way, how is your plant cultivation coming along?" Lin Shanshan asked.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">Ning Zhuo responded:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Speaking of that, I owe it all to you, Miss Lin. Youâ€™ve been a great help this time."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">"Iâ€™ve already figured out the general plan, and now I just need the necessary materials."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">Lin Shanshanâ€™s eyes lit up, and she eagerly asked:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"What do you need? Maybe I can help."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo said:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">"For the soil, I need Nine-Colored Divine Sand and Seven-Treasure Spiritual Earth. For water, I require the Milky Way Spiritual Liquid. If I could also get the Spring Wind of Ten Miles and Heavenly Melody, it would be even better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">At first intrigued, Lin Shanshanâ€™s face turned pale with each material he listed. Eventually, she hurriedly raised a hand to stop him:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Ning Zhuo, I think thereâ€™s been a misunderstanding. These materials are either incredibly valuable or extremely rare. Even the core medicine fields of the Myriad Medicine Sect only have a small amount of Five-Colored Divine Sand and Three-Treasure Spiritual Earth."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">"We do have some Milky Way Spiritual Liquid, but weâ€™ve only collected light from two or three stars. True top-grade liquid would require at least thirty-six stars."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"As for the Spring Wind of Ten Miles and Heavenly Melody, those are priceless treasures. Anyone who has them keeps them hidden, and they only appear at high-end auctions where high-level cultivators trade for them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Lin Shanshan sighed as she looked at Ning Zhuo:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">"Ning Zhuo, youâ€™ve only just started learning about cultivation, and the manuals youâ€™ve studied are the highest tier in our sect. Itâ€™s no wonder you have such misconceptions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Ning Zhuo was aware of the value of these materials. He had deliberately mentioned them to set the stage for his next request. Embarrassed, he rubbed his nose and said:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"I see. In that case..."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">"Iâ€™ll lower my requirements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">"Since your sect has Five-Colored Divine Sand and Three-Treasure Spiritual Earth, could I have a bit of them? Even Milky Way Spiritual Liquid with just two or three stars' worth of starlight would suffice. And as for the Spring Wind and Heavenly Melody, would a breeze of a few miles and some pleasant music be possible?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">Lin Shanshan blinked:  "That might be doable..."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Although these materials were still hard to obtain, when compared to his original request, they seemed more manageable. Nonetheless, Lin Shanshan remained troubled, her brow furrowing as she glanced at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">Seeing his clear gaze fixed on her, she looked away, just as she was about to explain the difficulties.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">"Buddhist Heart, Devilâ€™s Seal!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Life Hanging by a Thread!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">In the next moment, she sighed "Alright, Ning Zhuo, Iâ€™ll do my best to gather what you need."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Miss Lin, your assistance is deeply appreciated." Ning Zhuo stood up and bowed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Lin Shanshan bit her lip "Iâ€™ll do what I can."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo replied: "This is my task, and yet youâ€™ve consistently helped me. Iâ€™m willing to cooperate with you fully. Any resources or funds needed, I will cover. I certainly wouldnâ€™t want you to be funding this project for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Fine, follow me then." Lin Shanshan led Ning Zhuo from the training ground, seeking out her fellow disciples and sect elders, trying to gather the needed materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Myriad Medicine Sect specialized in various herbs, and its members were skilled in cultivation. Though most were reluctant, Lin Shanshanâ€™s personal pleas and discussions eventually led them to lend out the materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo naturally paid a hefty sum of spirit stones and other valuable treasures. Lin Shanshanâ€™s role was crucialâ€”no matter how wealthy Ning Zhuo was, without her connections, it would have been nearly impossible to obtain what he urgently needed. Even if he could have, the price would have been far higher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Alone later, Ning Zhuo returned to his cave and entered the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">In the spiritual plant cabin, Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and officially began setting up the cultivation area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
