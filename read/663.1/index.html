<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Greetings, everyone. Happy August.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The story arc in the Immortal City of White Paper was intentionally designed. The contrasting actions of Qing Chi and Ning Zhuo in the tributary of the River of Forgetfulness - one giving up, the other holding fast - may seem like opposites on the surface, but in truth, they resonate with the same persistent nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">There‚Äôs still a significant hidden thread in this story, which will be revealed later. This change came about due to a mid-way restructuring of the plot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">By this point in the book, some of my intentions as a writer may have become apparent - namely, that this is a story about growth. This growth focuses on the inner self. Ning Zhuo's active pursuit of growth, his journey out of the mountains to see the world and seek redemption, also reflects my own attitude toward life and personal trajectory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Sigh‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had a chat with you like this. In fact, over the past three or four months, I‚Äôve barely spoken even with the operations team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">I‚Äôve just been too exhausted!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">When I launched the new book in 2024, I was basically writing all day. Staying up until 3 or 4 a.m. was routine. The only time I got any fresh air was around 5 p.m., when I‚Äôd go out for a 30-minute walk and soak up some sunlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">(What can I say? I‚Äôm not the fastest writer. I‚Äôve embarrassed the industry - my bad! Haha.)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">At the time, I thought that was already an incredibly demanding lifestyle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">But in 2025, I realized I was wrong - things can get even more tiring, more hectic, more stressful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">During this period, I‚Äôve been immersing myself in real-world experiences, connecting with talents from various industries, and working to find and plan out a way to ‚Äúsave the tree‚Äù (revive the series/world/project).</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">It‚Äôs like being a lump of iron, forged and hammered in a furnace - trying to adapt, constantly shaken both physically and mentally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">I‚Äôve been leveling up my skills in business, management, and social interaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Some of you might have seen the related video on Bilibili titled ‚ÄúThe Most Accurate Restoration of the Great Love Immortal Lord.‚Äù At its peak, it ranked ninth site-wide and has garnered over 3 million views. That‚Äôs just a small part of what I‚Äôve been working on behind the scenes - a rare visible result.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">There are times I collapse in my chair too exhausted to move a finger. Other times I‚Äôm so anxious I can‚Äôt sleep all night. Along the way, I‚Äôve met all kinds of people and even made friends with some like-minded individuals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Of course, all of this came with a cost! (I‚Äôll share more fun stories in a livestream when I get the chance.)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">One big flaw I‚Äôve discovered about myself: I‚Äôm too optimistic when it comes to predicting progress. (That same optimism, though, has also helped me slog through a lot of tough mud.)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Right now, I‚Äôm still in the thick of adjusting. I can only do my best to keep updating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Thankfully, as I continue leveling up, I‚Äôve been adapting better. For example, I‚Äôve recently been able to update more consistently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">At this point, I must be honest - there will still be times when I need to take breaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">I fully accept all the criticism and misunderstandings from everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">After all, since I chose to ‚Äúsave the tree,‚Äù it‚Äôs my responsibility to carry that burden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Thank you all for your support and feedback!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Things are slowly improving now. As certain systems and structures begin to stabilize, I‚Äôll gradually have more time. That‚Äôs the current trend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">As for the missed updates, there‚Äôs a chance I can make them up in Q4.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">(I‚Äôll be more cautious with future promises to avoid over-optimism.)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">We‚Äôre still in the middle of the second major arc, and the upcoming chapters should align more with the style of modern web novels - in other words, more straightforwardly satisfying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Please don‚Äôt set your expectations too high for the update volume, though!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Thank you for sticking with me through it all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Oh, right - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Some readers mentioned that it‚Äôs been several months since we had any merchandise giveaways.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">That‚Äôs true - I‚Äôve just been too drained to put energy into that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Thankfully, we‚Äôve got the operations team!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">...The rest is about the giveaways.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
