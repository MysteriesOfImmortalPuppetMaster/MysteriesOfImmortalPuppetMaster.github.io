<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Wind Chime!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">In an instant, Zhu Xuanji was startled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Once the Fate Energy undergoes drastic changes, it will stir up winds and clouds, change the color of the heavens and earth, forming a grand Fate Energy that affects countless people and various powers. If the Fate Energy expands, it will lead to frequent wars and turbulent times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This Wind Chime was bestowed by the monarch, specifically used to detect drastic changes in Fate Energy and its influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"The Wind Chime has sounded. Is it a natural surge of Fate Energy, or is someone using a technique?" Zhu Xuanji instinctively looked up towards the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He had long known about Meng Kui's divine ability, the Mountain Watching Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong's unreasonable behavior would not make Zhu Xuanji back down. He had many methods to punish such offenders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">But now, he didn't want to do so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Before this trip, the monarch had specifically instructed him to be wary of changes in Fate Energy and to be cautious of Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhu Xuanji kept this in mind, knowing that he had no means to suppress the Fate Energy. Now that the Wind Chime had sounded, if he continued to be involved in this situation, he would inevitably be affected. Even if he stayed home with doors locked, the changes in Fate Energy would still bring disaster to him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Zhu Xuanji himself had no means to interfere with Fate Energy. The only plan now was to withdraw early. Being outside the situation, he wouldn't be affected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Today, I'll let you off for now. I will come for you." Zhu Xuanji released his spiritual power, pushing Sun Lingtong away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He disappeared from the spot, swiftly heading towards the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">It wasn't until he was several hundred miles away from Fire Persimmon Mountain that the Wind Chime stopped its ominous ringing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Such a small range of Fate Energy fluctuations, with such drastic changes in Fate Energy, makes Meng Kui even more suspicious. If the Fate Energy field does not expand later, it is most likely due to Meng Kui's Mountain Watching Technique!" Zhu Xuanji's face was gloomy, and he immediately decided to rely on the Wind Chime's detection range for verification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">As Zhu Xuanji left, Sun Lingtong stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong was incredulous, thinking to himself, "Did I just scare Zhu Xuanji away so easily?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">On the surface, he spat and wiped his face, seeing the stunned street vendors, he shouted, "Did you see that? Learn from it!" He then looked at his subordinates and urgently asked, "Did you record it?" The subordinate nodded, "It's all in the Jade Slip."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sun Lingtong laughed heartily three times, "Excellent! This is my greatest achievement in life. Spread the word, say that I, Sun Lingtong, with Foundation Establishment cultivation, forced Golden Core Zhu Xuanji to retreat! Hahaha, I'm going to be famous, I'm going to be famous! If anyone doubts, just throw the Jade Slip in their face."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Yes, quickly make dozens, no, hundreds of copies of the Jade Slip, and distribute them for safekeeping to prevent confiscation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Sun Lingtong's methods are shrewd. He wants to establish his reputation first and then use it to pressure Zhu Xuanji, preparing for the future when Zhu Xuanji comes back for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">As Zhu Xuanji left the city, Ning Zhuo entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Unlike when he left the city, Ning Zhuo's team now included Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Yuan Er and Ning Pi sat in a carriage, their eyes occasionally glancing at the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng sitting beside Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Their conversation came to an end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"So that's how it is." Ning Zhuo sighed lightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He understood the whole story.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">It turned out that in a few days, it would be Yuan Yi's death anniversary, and as his son, Yuan Er had to visit his grave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The burial site had over a dozen locations, but the real grave was the one where Yuan Dasheng lost control, driven by emotions, and rushed to that desolate wilderness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The other fake graves were deliberately set up by Ai Yi. On one hand, it was to prevent others from robbing the grave out of revenge; on the other hand, it served as bait to lure hidden enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">After all, in the cultivation world, there are many methods to use corpses to curse others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Yuan Er originally didn't want to leave the Monkey Head Gang's base, but this was a ritual for his ancestor, the founder of the Monkey Head Gang, so he had to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The elders of the gang were also urging him to do it. If he didn't, he would inevitably be labeled as cowardly and unfilial by those with ill intentions. This would be a fatal blow to Yuan Er's already miserable reputation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Yuan Er had no choice but to comply. He originally wanted to contact Ning Pi to expedite the creation of Yuan Dasheng's mechanical construct. However, the messengers he sent out never returned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Yuan Er did everything he could to hide his movements, deliberately setting out a few days early to secretly perform the ritual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Unexpectedly, he encountered an ambush on the way, and all his followers were killed, leaving him alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Instinctively, he fled to the burial site he knew, and miraculously, he encountered the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">After that, Yuan Dasheng, under Ning Zhuo's orders, went to rescue him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Mr. Ning, this must be the Monkey Uncle mechanism you made for me, right? It must be!" Yuan Er couldn't contain his excitement, his eyes fixed on Yuan Dasheng, full of eagerness and longing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"It's really strong, its combat power far exceeds the peak of Foundation Establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Mr. Ning, you are a man of your word, and I admire you greatly!" Yuan Er praised endlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Pi smiled slightly, patting the arm of the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng, "This is just the initial version, freshly made. My trip outside the city was mainly to find wild beasts to test the capabilities of the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng through actual combat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Tree Martial Ape Dasheng," Yuan Er savored the name, his eyes shining, giving a thumbs up, "Mr. Ning, your expertise in Mechanism Technique is profound, and your naming skills are also extraordinary. It's very fitting, extremely fitting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Can we hand it over now?" Ning Zhuo shook his head, "No rush, no rush."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Through battles with beasts and cultivators, I found many areas that need improvement in the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Once I finish the improvements, I will hand it over to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"My creations are always top-notch. I won't hastily hand over a crude initial version."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Yuan Er's eyes widened, anxious, "But, Mr. Ning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"You see, I'm in great danger now, very dangerous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"This time, if I hadn't been lucky enough to run into you, I would have died, died at the hands of those despicable, insidious, ruthless, and vicious assassins!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"The key is, you let a few assassins go. I, I..." At this point, Yuan Er was so agitated that he stuttered and couldn't speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Pi sighed, spreading his hands, giving a perfect explanation, "I couldn't see the specific scene at that time. I'm only at the Qi Refining Stage, not the Foundation Establishment Stage, I don't have Divine Sense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The Tree Martial Ape Dasheng is controlled by my staff head. The staff head contains my Divine Thought, and I set it to engage in unlimited combat with any hostile targets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"So, when some assassins lost their killing intent and fled in panic, the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng wasn't triggered and didn't pursue them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"If I had been there, I would have eradicated all evil!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Yuan Er blinked repeatedly, his mouth dry, "I know about the staff head."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"To be honest, Mr. Ning, ever since you promised to make me a Foundation Establishment-level mechanical battle puppet, I've been scouring the gang's library, studying related knowledge day and night, and practicing various Mechanism Techniques tirelessly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"If you hand over the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng to me now, I will definitely make good use of it! I..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Pi's face darkened, his tone displeased, "Enough, Gang Leader Yuan Er, you don't need to persuade me anymore."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"This is my principle. I won't hand over the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng until I've finished the improvements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"You must understand, a shoddy product would tarnish my reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"I plan to pursue the path of Mechanism Technique in the future, and my reputation must be protected from the start!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Pi spoke righteously, completely forgetting about the shoddy Mechanical Explosive Monkey he had made before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">If Chen Cha heard this, he would surely be gratified, thinking that Ning Zhuo had found his way back and that a prodigal son returning was indeed a fortunate thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Yuan Er's breathing was heavy, his mouth slightly open, with many words he wanted to say, but under Ning Zhuo's stern expression, he ultimately didn't say them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Although Ning Zhuo was only at the Qi Refining Stage, his status was now different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Mechanism Carriage he rode in, and the guards accompanying it, all made Yuan Er feel the difference in their statuses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Pi continued to reassure him, "Gang Leader Yuan Er, don't be too nervous, it's fine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Now that you're in the city, I'll take you directly to the gang's base later."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"You've already performed the ritual for your father, I can testify for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"You can use my connection to intimidate the traitors in the gang. I believe they won't be so reckless as to let assassins into the gang's base."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Yuan Er's face was pale, "Yes, they shouldn't be that impulsive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"But the enemies left behind by my father and Uncle Dasheng when they rose to power are different!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo immediately retorted, "They can't get into the gang's base either. If they could, they would have succeeded in assassinating you long ago, wouldn't they?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"After all, in the past, Yuan Dasheng wasn't always guarding you, was he?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Yuan Er's forehead was covered in a fine layer of sweat, "This, it seems like that... it should be like that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"If Mr. Ning could hand it over now, that would be best."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Yuan Er's face was full of sorrow, his tone pleading.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo mercilessly shook his head, refusing again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">In the end, he followed the agreement and took Yuan Er directly back to the Monkey Head Gang's base, attracting the attention of countless gang members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Yuan Er was somewhat reluctant to get off the carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Under Ning Zhuo's urging, he reluctantly glanced at the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng one last time before getting off the carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Let's go back." Ning Zhuo waved his hand, and the team set off again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Leaving Yuan Er standing in place, watching the Mechanism Carriage disappear from sight, he finally moved his leaden feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Returning to the empty inner room, his longing for Yuan Dasheng intensified to the extreme, causing him to silently shed two lines of tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">****************</paragraph><br/><br/>
