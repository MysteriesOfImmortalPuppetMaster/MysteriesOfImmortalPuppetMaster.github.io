<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">While Han Ming was forced into battle, Sun Lingtong took a step and penetrated space, landing in the medicine storage room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellets!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Foundation Establishment Pills!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Resurrection Pills!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Origin Returning Pills!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Hehehe…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong shook his chubby little hand, causing the bracelet on his lotus-like wrist to shine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">This was a powerful storage-type magic artifact. All the pills caught under its light disappeared on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Outside the door, sword light flashed and ghostly shadows flew about.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Han Ming’s expression sank as she found herself unable to quickly get rid of her enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This kind of prolonged battle was precisely what she’d been hoping to avoid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">She suddenly snorted coldly and unleashed her demonic technique – Nine Turns Soul Devouring Incantation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The sword cultivator staggered slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But at the same time, his flying sword shot out, aiming directly for Han Ming’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Han Ming didn’t dodge or avoid it, instead swinging her arm with all her strength and launching a flying shuttle from her sleeve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This flying shuttle was only one chi long, and its color was bluish-gray like a stone. There were spikes all over its surface, and it was bizarrely misshapen. As it flew out, it seemed slow but was actually incredibly fast, piercing through the sword cultivator’s body in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">At the exact same moment, the sword cultivator’s flying sword pierced through Han Ming’s heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">It seemed like a mutual loss, but Han Ming’s sinister smile showed the delight of victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Her innate talent was called the Yin Corpse Qi, giving her affinity for both soul- and corpse-type cultivation methods. She joined the Soul Devouring Sect and learned the Nine Turns Soul Devouring Incantation, but in secret, she also cultivated a corpse-type cultivation method – the Immortal Zombie Life Transformation Grand Magic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">She had successfully transformed her internal organs into zombie organs, and no longer had fatal weaknesses in the conventional sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It didn’t matter to her even if her zombie heart was pierced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">But her opponent’s situation was completely different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Han Ming’s shuttle was no ordinary object. It was a magic artifact that harmonized perfectly with the Nine Turns Soul Devouring Incantation – the Soul Capturing Shuttle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After piercing into the sword cultivator’s body, it generated a powerful suction and forcibly sucked out part of the sword cultivator’s soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The sword cultivator’s face immediately turned pale, and his body trembled violently. In just an instant, he had been severely injured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Even if you’re at the peak of Foundation Establishment, you’re nothing but a rogue cultivator. What gave you the guts to oppose a major demonic sect like mine?” Han Ming showed a cruel smile. “Die for me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">But at that moment, the sword cultivator suddenly tossed out a talisman – the Space Escape Talisman!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">In an instant, the talisman exploded into fluctuating spatial power, causing the sword cultivator to disappear on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Han Ming snorted coldly. Her enemy had escaped without dying, leaving her unable to vent her anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">She was about to rush into the medicine storage room, but suddenly received a voice transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As it turned out, Sun Lingtong had already swept the storage room clean and made a quick escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Sun Lingtong’s voice echoed in her ears: “I got the things, let’s go!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Han Ming couldn’t suppress the killing intent in her heart. “Haha, isn’t it a pity to give up such a good chance?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">She began moving in the direction of the alchemy room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Han Ming hated Sun Lie very much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Previously, she had fought hard to obtain the Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellets, but got nothing in the end, and even became a wanted criminal in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, forcing her into hiding for more than a year. During this period of time, she had attempted to assassinate the alchemist many times, but never succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Han Ming smashed the door open and rushed toward Sun Lie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lie heard movement outside the door, but the alchemy process had already begun, leaving him unable to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“It’s you!” Seeing Han Ming, Sun Lie had no choice but to muster his strength and fight while standing still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In this sort of situation, he couldn’t even exert 40% of his true battle prowess. Naturally, he was no match for Han Ming and was soon defeated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lie flew backwards and hit the wall, bleeding from all seven orifices as he fell to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Die for me!” Han Ming laughed shrilly, feeling extremely happy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Five fingers shot out like sharp claws, fingertips wrapped in eerie bluish-gray yin energy as she fiercely grabbed at Sun Lie’s head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The next moment, the Purple Sun Furnace broke open, and a bolt of lightning shot out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This was beyond Han Ming's expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">She didn’t expect that the alchemy furnace here wasn’t concocting pills, but refining a young genius!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Meng Chong had heard the sounds of battle from within the alchemy furnace and realized that the Purple Sun Villa was under attack. There had been an attempt on his life not long ago; now that he had left the City Lord Mansion to come to the Purple Sun Villa, he was quite sensitive to such matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He had immediately shouted to Sun Lie, wanting to exit the furnace and join the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But Sun Lie had stopped him. “Once the alchemy process begins, it can’t be interrupted. Meng Chong, your magical power is already leaking out. Once you leave the furnace, there won’t be any nourishing medicinal materials; combined with the lack of external pressure, your three treasures – your essence, qi, and spirit – will leak out as well. At that time, not only will your cultivation disappear, your body will dry up, too. You’ll become a cripple and live a life worse than death!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Meng Chong had realized the severity of the issue and thus hesitated for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">But now, hearing Sun Lie spitting out blood and Han Ming’s triumphant laugh, he could no longer bear it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">His blood rushed to his head, subconsciously stimulating his immortal talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Crackle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">For a moment, endless arcs of lightning swirled around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Meng Chong’s eyes widened with rage. He knocked open the furnace door and rushed out like a tiger freed from its shackles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He was fast, too fast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Han Ming glanced backward and seemed to see a tiger made of thunder roaring toward her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Meng Chong was only a Qi Refining cultivator, and his loss of power left him at only the third level. As for Han Ming, she was a cultivator at the peak of Foundation Establishment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">She sensed Meng Chong’s aura, but her enemy, Sun Lie, was right in front of her. Thus, Han Ming ruthlessly continued attacking Sun Lie, intending to rely solely on her defenses to resist Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">In the next moment, blindingly bright lightning ferociously struck Han Ming’s back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The yin soul power that Han Ming put her everything into was crushed like rotting wood. The extremely domineering yang power of thunder rushed into her body, wreaking havoc all over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">In just a single breath, all of Han Ming’s internal organs were severely damaged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Han Ming spat out a mouthful of chilly gray blood, and had no choice but to halt her attack on Sun Lie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">She had rich combat experience and instantly realized how dangerous her situation was. No longer caring about killing her enemy, she threw out a Space Escape Talisman and fled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“You want to run!?” Meng Chong roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Han Ming had his thunder power coursing through her, allowing him to sense her location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Space Escape Talisman that Han Ming had just used was of average quality, only allowing for random teleportation no more than six li away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This was completely within range for Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">However, just as Meng Chong was about to give chase, he heard Sun Lie speak out to stop him. “No need to pursue!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Meng Chong was startled, then realized that saving Sun Lie was his top priority.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He hurried over to Sun Lie, but he didn’t know what to do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Meng Chong was pretty much only good at fighting. Saving lives was outside his expertise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Han Ming was severely injured, so after forcibly adjusting her breathing, she teleported away again and left the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Sun Lingtong had been the first to withdraw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo was the last. Abandoning the mechanical constructs here, he left without a care in the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">As for the Foundation Establishment cultivator who had been fighting him… that person had was now a corpse on a Hanging-Hair Hooked Death Whip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Soon, the three conspirators met up again in the agreed-upon location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Han Ming glanced at the corpse hanging on the Hanging-Hair Hooked Death Whip, then at Hanging-Hair Traveler, who had no traces of battle on his body. She felt a slight chill in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Right now, she was shrouded in yin energy and had a powerful aura. Nowhere did she seem like someone who had just been severely injured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Han Ming said coldly, “Let’s part here. Give me the Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellets, and I also want one third of the other pills.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo immediately frowned. “One third? My contributions were much greater than yours.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Han Ming sneered and immediately argued, “It was thanks to me severely injuring Sun Lie that Meng Chong didn’t come after us!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Meng Chong is only at the third level of the Qi Refining stage, but his battle prowess is incredible. He’s worthy of being a genius with a super-grade immortal talent! Do you think your mechanical constructs could have stopped him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo snorted coldly and said nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Come on, you two, don’t argue. This operation was a great success, we should all be happy.” Sun Lingtong laughed and threw a pill bottle to Han Ming. “Those are your Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellets.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Han Ming immediately uncorked the bottle to check. The moment she looked inside, a black mist sprayed out and hit her face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">In an instant, Han Ming’s aura plummeted, her soul was sealed, and she nearly collapsed on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Her face was full of disbelief, shock, and anger. “Sun Lingtong, you tricked me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Whoosh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The next moment, three Hanging-Hair Hooked Death Whips silently struck, piercing into Han Ming’s body and tying her up like coiling snakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo’s voice echoed out faintly: “Better to share between two people than three.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
