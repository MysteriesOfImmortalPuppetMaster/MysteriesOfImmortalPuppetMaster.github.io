<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo, dressed in white, looked clean and refreshed as he stepped into the cave abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Before meeting Lord Qingwu, he had already received treatment and had been arranged to take a bath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The layout deep inside the cave abode was quite simple; it was almost empty, save for a bronze suit of armor enshrined on a profound altar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The armor plates of this suit were quite heavy, the green copper resembling moss traces, and distributed across it were some scars from sabers and axes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Its style was clearly not of current fashion, exuding an aura as dignified as a mountain and as ancient as a river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, the bronze armor emitted a faint white light. Within the white light, a figure floated out from the interior of the armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">His appearance was that of a middle-aged male cultivator, with a majestic eight-foot frame and muscles knotting and bulging. His face seemed carved by wind and frost, with angular features, and his short beard on his lower jaw resembled short bronze halberds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">His eyes revealed a deep azure light as his gaze fell upon Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo immediately felt a cold sharpness, like that of a weapon, from this gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo bowed in salute: "Junior Ning Zhuo pays respects to the Lord!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He was well-versed in intelligence and naturally understood that the deity before him was the supreme leader of the Profound Armor Cave, having transformed from an artifact spirit into a god.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Lord Qingwu retracted his gaze and spoke indifferently: "No need for formalities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He continued: "This god has watched the recording of your trial; your performance can be described as stunning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"At first, your strength was meager, and no one favored you, but relying on aptitude surpassing ordinary people, you learned while practicing and ultimately achieved first place. It was truly brilliant."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"You were able to create battle formations, plan before acting while surrounded by enemies, and borrow strength to break through situations... Your strategy, character, and comprehension are all top-tier choices. Obtaining the top rank this time is well-deserved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"I believe that once this result spreads, you will once again make a name for yourself within the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo responded: "The God Lord overpraises me. This junior is terrified; it was merely some trivial wit. I moved with the momentum and mostly had good luck. I dare not accept such high praise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"You can bear it." Lord Qingwu's blue eyes turned slightly. "You are also aware that the purpose of the Profound Armor Cave holding the Rising Cloud Minor Trial is to distribute the Profound Weapon Armors to suitable cultivators as much as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"The reward for the first place in every Rising Cloud Minor Trial at the Profound Armor Cave is based on this, so the rewards are usually similar each time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"But this time..." Lord Qingwu changed the subject, "The reward is different."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He stared at Ning Zhuo: "I will grant you three True Intents, and furthermore strip the corresponding principles, injecting them all into your body!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He widened his eyes in disbelief, looking up at Lord Qingwu, feeling as if he had misheard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He knew the weight of "True Intent" all too well!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Previously, the Five Elements God Lord had taught him the profundities of the Five Elements, which was to instill his own Five Elements True Intent into him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo's Five Elements realm skyrocketed because of this, so much so that when he traveled the world afterward, he benefited countless times from the Five Elements realm, which brought him immense help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Now, this ancient deity also wanted to instill his True Intent, as well as principles, into him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo frowned, unable to figure out this point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The main reason he participated in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial was to intercept Ban Ji. When the time came, he also strove for first place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Regarding the first-place reward, he knew the intelligence well and didn't have much expectation in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He absolutely never expected that the reward for first place this time would be so generous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">After the surprise came doubt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo carefully weighed his words and spoke slowly: "The Lord grants a heavy gift, this junior is... overwhelmed by the favor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"True Intent is precious; this junior can still do his utmost to carry and comprehend a thing or two. But these 'principles'... this junior is only at the Foundation Establishment cultivation level, with a humble soul and a frail physical body. How can I bear the weight of this heaven and earth?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo was confident about the instillation of True Intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But having principles added to his body was another matter entirely. This was similar to Artifact Refining; cultivators constantly hammer the artifact embryo, and while shaping it, they also forcefully add various types of principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">When cultivators set up formations or inscribe talismans on an artifact embryo, they are adding all sorts of principles to it, endowing the final product with various powers and profound uses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The tempered artifact embryo is forged from various precious materials and is usually an inanimate object that cannot feel pain. But a cultivator's physical body is living. To have principles added to the body is equivalent to treating the cultivator's physical body as an artifact embryo and performing Artifact Refining on it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">This is not only excruciatingly painful, but the more terrifying consequences range from disordered cultivation to the destruction of the physical body and stepping into a realm of doom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">True Intent instillation is comprehended with the heart; it tests one's enlightenment and belongs to the mind's understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Principles added to the body is a somatic experience; the core point is whether the physical body can support it, belonging to the body's understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Examples of principles added to the body can be found everywhere. The vast majority of magic treasures and magical artifacts fall into this category. They are all inanimate objects and cannot comprehend principles, but the principles engraved on them allow them to have various effects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The same goes for the Profound Weapon Armors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">They are used by cultivators, and during the process of use, they record the principles of many martial arts. Therefore, even if these Profound Weapon Armors leave their original owners, they can still execute past martial arts moves and so on by themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo had confidence in his own comprehension and leaned more towards True Intent instillation. But as for principles added to the body, he did not want it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Lord Qingwu shook his head slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo had two attitudes towards True Intent and principles, but Lord Qingwu needed Ning Zhuo to carry both of them over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He needed to purify his own Dao Path!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Then he had to discard the other three paths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Normal cultivators actively choose one path during their cultivation and do not get overly involved in other paths. Lord Qingwu's background was very special; He was an artifact spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor itself originated from the Machine Sect; the main body was forged using the skills of Artifact Refining and Mechanisms, while also containing the principles of the Military Strategist and Martial Sects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor has survived to this day. The Flying Cloud Assembly and many more Rising Cloud Minor Trials have allowed many cultivators to possess their own Profound Weapon Armors. And after these Profound Weapon Armors fed back into the Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor's main body, it continuously accumulated in these four aspects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Lord Qingwu had no way to choose; He could only passively accumulate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Once He possessed the status of a god, the majority of these accumulations became burdens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">And to throw away these burdens, He had to discard both the True Intent and the principles simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Lord Qingwu persuaded Ning Zhuo: "There is no need to worry too much, Ning Zhuo. Others cannot do it, but you can."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo was stunned. Meeting Lord Qingwu's azure eyes, he felt the other party's certainty. It was a confidence far stronger than his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Why? On what basis?" Ning Zhuo's face was written full of such doubts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Lord Qingwu's gaze flickered slightly, and with a low voice, He recounted a past event to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Twelve years ago, I was trapped in a bottleneck on the divine path and secretly visited a demon cultivator proficient in divination. That person was known as the 'Mystic Master Dunjia'..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo listened carefully, his expression changing indefinitely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">When Lord Qingwu finished his statement, Ning Zhuo frowned even tighter: "So, I am your 'Fated Person', Lord?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Lord Qingwu nodded: "I myself was somewhat skeptical. However, twelve years have passed, the time for the divination has arrived, the top name has been decided, and you have actively appeared before Me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"The Mystic Master calculated that you are naturally gifted, with flourishing Qi Luck, far beyond comparable to ordinary people! As for borrowing your body to perform this method of 'True Intent stripping, Dao Principle addition'... The Mystic Master asserted that you can withstand it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"As for True Intent, you should know that this is also a huge opportunity for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"As for principles added to the body, why don't I try a little first? Just a slight test. If it cannot be done, stopping in time will suffice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo frowned in thought and asked Sun Lingtong in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability allowed Ning Zhuo to communicate secretly even in front of Lord Qingwu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Inside the Rinse Jade Study, Sun Lingtong shrugged: "The suggestion this Lord made is very good. Even if some principles are added to your body, at worst I'll help you remove them in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The foundation of the Profound Armor Cave's power lies in the Myriad Manifestations Sect. He also needs to abide by the sect's rules, so if He wants to harm you, He will face severe punishment from the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"He has also been frank about these reasons; his sincerity is obvious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Sun Lingtong's view was very similar to Ning Zhuo's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Mystic Master Dunjia calculated that I am the fated person. If this matter is not false, I should have the ability to bear these principles!" Ning Zhuo had the experience of the White Paper Immortal City, which added a lot of confidence out of thin air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After resting slightly, Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on the rush cushion, sitting opposite the main body of the Nine-Layered Profound Weapon Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Before transmitting, Lord Qingwu spoke solemnly: "My comprehension in the three paths of the Military Strategist, Artifact Refining, and Mechanisms are all in here. Receive them well!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Buzz - !</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The mottled and heavy bronze armor suddenly shone brightly, no longer dull, erupting with blinding azure-gold divine light!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ancient runes on the armor plates revealed themselves, like hundreds of millions of swimming tadpoles, moving rapidly and colliding with each other. Countless collisions sparked thousands of sparks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">A massive True Intent sprayed out because of this, carrying an invisible impact force that caused Ning Zhuo's upper body to sway, almost falling backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo felt like a stone thrown into an incomparably huge grinding pan that was being stirred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The initial feeling was complexity and chaos, overwhelming to the point of near suffocation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">At the same time, images of tens of thousands of different ores, spirit wood, bone materials, beast hides, demon blood, and other precious materials flew past his eyes, fluttering like snowflakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Hammers, tongs, anvils, files, tweezers, carving knives, furnaces... and other Artifact Refining tools were mixed within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The most basic and shallow Artifact Refining techniques surged like seawater, directly flooding Ning Zhuo's divine sea like viewing flowers from a galloping horse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo was dazzled, his spirit highly concentrated, and with a slightly nervous emotion, he rapidly received this stream of True Intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He had experience, and his learning and comprehension abilities had already been greatly improved, so much so that he was handling it with ease at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Good comprehension!" Lord Qingwu praised in his heart. "Next is the injection of principles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Thus, in the next moment, Ning Zhuo's body felt a sensation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">His whole body's skin seemed to be experiencing the friction of various materials - the rough coldness of ores, the warmth of spirit wood, the residual heat of scorched metal, the sticky slipperiness of demon blood...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">His nasal cavity was filled with the smells of sulfur, charcoal, molten metal, herbal juices, and various other scents; some fragrant, some rich, some bitter, some pungent...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">His ears were filled with the roar of furnace fire, the striking of metal, the cracking of materials, the low humming of artifact embryos...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He felt it as if it were happening to himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Lord Qingwu slowly stopped, his eyes twinkling with light of joy: "You really are my opportunity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">This was what both sides had agreed upon: try the cultivation first and see the effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The first attempt was a huge success!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"In just a short moment, my Artifact Refining realm has already reached the peak of the apprentice level!" Ning Zhuo rejoiced in his heart; he was not very surprised by his absorption and comprehension of the True Intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">What surprised him was his physical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"The principles added to my body can actually be perfectly withstood, and they even mesh with the relevant True Intent, helping me understand more profoundly from a somatic perspective!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"This is really amazing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sun Lingtong had been paying close attention to the situation here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Upon learning this at this moment, he immediately shouted: "Little Zhuo, your body has unique mysteries. Under normal circumstances, having these principles added to the body is like refining a flesh and blood body as a magic treasure. It would be strange not to be injured!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"I originally estimated that you would suffer some minor injuries."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"But the result is like this. How strange!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo pondered: "Could this be related to my second innate talent?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He carefully checked his body again and found that his muscles were just tight all over, and he had only broken into a thin layer of sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"How does it feel?" Lord Qingwu asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo's eyes shone: "Excellent. Please continue, Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Lord Qingwu smiled slightly and immediately acted again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">True Intent instillation, principles added to the body; Ning Zhuo's foundation was expanding at an inconceivable magnitude, skyrocketing exaggeratedly every minute and second!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">In another cave abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ban Ji's expression changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ban Jie was discussing the next plan of action with him, and seeing his expression change, he immediately asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ban Ji shook his head slowly, subconsciously covering his chest with his hand: "Just at that moment, I suddenly felt empty, as if an important treasure had been snatched away by someone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Speaking of this, Ban Ji couldn't help but laugh: "It's just an illusion, not worth mentioning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Hearing this, Ban Jie's heart sank, and she couldn't help but think of the Profound Armor Cave: "Although the first place reward of the Profound Armor Cave is generous, it's just so-so. What would truly be helpful to Ban Ji should be something else. But what exactly it is, there is no way to investigate now. Sigh..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ban Jie sighed in her heart, but on the surface, she was calm as the clouds and wind: "Even if Ning Zhuo gets the first place reward, it's nothing much."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Ban Ji, our failure this time does not harm the overall situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"The family has increased its efforts even more and is about to send a bottle of Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pills."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ban Ji immediately raised his eyebrows, revealing a look of surprise: "What? This kind of precious pill can improve my physical foundation and greatly reduce the difficulty when I overcome the outbreak of the Myriad Puppet Demon Monster."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"The family has finally collected this type of medicinal pill; I've mentioned it countless times before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Speaking of this, Ban Ji took out a set of Profound Weapon Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">This Profound Weapon Armor was exactly what he had refined from the copper lake; it was a reward that every cultivator could obtain after clearing the third level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">As for the Profound Weapon Armors they "subdued" in the second level, those were treasures of the Profound Armor Cave and were only temporarily lent to the cultivators attempting the trials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ban Ji looked at the Profound Weapon Armor in his hand: "If I had known there was the Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pill, why would I have gone to beg for some Profound Weapon Armor?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The reason why the Myriad Puppet Demon Monster immortal talent outbreak put Ban Ji in danger was that the principles of Mechanisms and the Strange Path added to his body were difficult for Ban Ji to bear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">After refining the Profound Weapon Armor, it was equivalent to being one entity. This gave Ban Ji more empty space to carry the principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pill, on the other hand, was an auxiliary medicinal pill that could harmonize the principles on a cultivator's physical body and arrange them reasonably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">If the help brought to Ban Ji by the Profound Weapon Armor was one, then the help from the Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pill was at least fifty!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">With the Hundred Refinement Golden Body Pill, Ban Ji immediately looked down on the Profound Weapon Armor a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ban Jie knew the truth but sighed again in his heart: "The family had collected this type of pill long ago, but for the grand plan of stimulating the Royal Mandate, they kept it withheld and unused."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"But in this Rising Cloud Minor Trial, the Human Tribulation was fierce, and Ban Ji was defeated again. After the family used the Clan Destiny Pivot Chain to calculate, they figured out that they must strengthen Ban Ji, otherwise his prospects would be dim and lightless, let alone stimulating the Royal Mandate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Only then did they fetch the pills and send them over."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Ban Jie thought of Ning Zhuo: "I wonder what he will obtain?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"Some opportunities that are of great benefit to Ban Ji may not necessarily be suitable for others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"It might even be a disaster rather than a blessing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ban Jie comforted herself, but couldn't help her thoughts drifting: "But Ban Ji's loss just now is probably not an illusion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"And with this failure, Ban Ji's Qi Luck has fallen sharply, and he can only consume precious pills to make up for it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Will Ning Zhuo's Qi Luck soar?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
