<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Standing inside the spiritual plant cabin, Ning Zhuo first activated the cabin's formation. This formation came standard with the Ten Thousand Li Dragon's Journey—a basic setup that provided spiritual power and included spatial compression abilities, allowing for a massive amount of space to be folded into the cabin.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo began to set up a new formation, expanding upon this basic one. He placed several Eight Trigram Stones at the key points and used a stylus to carve intricate formation patterns, eventually embedding a Heavenly Jade Stone as the core, with various spirit jades forming the energy nodes.<br/>
<br/>
This was the Eight Trigram Return Wind Formation. He arranged the spirit jades according to the Eight Trigram positions. Once the formation was activated, a whirlwind of spiritual energy immediately formed inside the cabin. From now on, Ning Zhuo could control the flow of spiritual energy within the cabin. He adjusted the formation for a long time until he reached a satisfactory state where streams of energy circulated steadily, with the energy points fixed in place.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the prototype of an artificial spiritual vein!" Ning Zhuo said with a sense of accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
He continued building. Taking out a large amount of Xuanhuang Earth, he filled the cabin with it. The soil quickly piled up to his waist, but Ning Zhuo activated the cabin's base formation, causing the space inside the soil to compress and fold.<br/>
<br/>
The soil level rapidly dropped to his ankles. Ning Zhuo paused the compression, poured more soil, and repeated the process three times until the soil reached the required standard.<br/>
<br/>
Next, he took out the precious Three-Treasure Spirit Earth. This particular soil was extraordinary, created from a combination of the Heavenly Treasure Purple Cloud Wind, the Earth Treasure Magma Blood, and the Human Treasure Hero’s Ash. After careful refinement and rituals, the soil had become extremely valuable. Even in the Myriad Medicine Sect, only top-tier medicinal plants required such soil.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Lin Shanshan, Ning Zhuo, an outsider, had managed to obtain this rare treasure—something nearly impossible to find even in large immortal cities.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo first dug a pit, placed the Three-Treasure Spirit Earth into it, and then spread Five-Colored Divine Sand evenly over the soil. From a bottle hidden in his robes, he carefully poured Milky Way Spiritual Liquid into the pit. The liquid shimmered with starlight, mesmerizing to behold, as it moistened the soil.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo patiently waited. After a while, he crouched down, using his divine sense to inspect the soil's condition. Finding it still somewhat dry, he cautiously poured in more Milky Way Spiritual Liquid, adding only a small amount each time until it reached the perfect state.<br/>
<br/>
He had Sun Lingtong come over to check as well, to ensure he hadn’t missed anything or made a mistake on his first attempt. Sun Lingtong didn’t have deep knowledge in this area, so he compared the pit to his experience in stealing spiritual plants, noting that the pit resembled the ones left behind after uprooting them.<br/>
<br/>
"It feels just right!" he said to Ning Zhuo upon returning.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo understood that Sun Lingtong's affirmation was more of a reassurance than an expert opinion. After double-checking everything to ensure that every detail met the standards, Ning Zhuo planted the Spirit Concealing Willow in the pit. He then filled in the soil and compacted it.<br/>
<br/>
He reactivated the Eight Trigram Return Wind Formation, carefully adjusting the streams of spiritual energy around the Spirit Concealing Willow. Three streams of energy circulated through the soil, nourishing the tree’s roots, while two others flowed through its trunk and branches.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, the spiritual energy surrounding the Spirit Concealing Willow was far more concentrated than before, but it still lacked a natural feel. A key aspect of cultivating spiritual plants is mimicking the natural environment, especially in the initial stages. The dense energy streams didn't disperse naturally, so Ning Zhuo set up a second formation.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, both the second and third formations were complete. Once activated, a gentle spring breeze blew, accelerating the dispersal of the energy streams, while melodious sounds, reminiscent of birds chirping, filled the air. These formations used the Three-Mile Spring Breeze and Pleasant Melody.<br/>
<br/>
The willow's branches swayed gently in the breeze, as though enjoying the rare peace and comfort. Under the nourishment of abundant spiritual energy, the leaves gleamed with a jade-like luster, even more radiant than before.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sighed in admiration:  <br/>
"This environment is so nice—I almost want to move in here to sleep!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head.  <br/>
"It’s better to leave this space for the Spirit Concealing Willow."  <br/>
"We’ve consumed a lot of its energy recently. Let’s allow it to rest and recover its full vitality as soon as possible."<br/>
<br/>
After finishing his work, Ning Zhuo was exhausted. He slept soundly, and the next day, he headed to Yuanshan Mountain to meet Lin Shanshan.<br/>
<br/>
However, he was intercepted at the foot of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
"You’re Ning Zhuo, right?" The cultivator blocking his path was a short man named Lao De, a Foundation Establishment disciple.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah, Senior Brother Lao. Yes, I am Ning Zhuo," Ning Zhuo replied with a smile, politely greeting him.<br/>
<br/>
Lao De crossed his arms and scanned Ning Zhuo from head to toe with a disdainful look:  <br/>
"Who gave you permission to call me 'Senior Brother'? You’re not even part of the Myriad Medicine Sect."<br/>
<br/>
"Daoist Lao," Ning Zhuo calmly corrected himself, keeping his tone respectful.<br/>
<br/>
Lao De snorted:  <br/>
"I’m Shanshan’s third senior brother. Do you know that she’s been running around with you lately, neglecting her cultivation?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately became serious:  <br/>
"I deeply appreciate Miss Lin’s help and will never forget it. I will certainly repay her in the future!"<br/>
<br/>
Lao De waved dismissively:  <br/>
"Enough with your promises of future repayment. The Sect Master has already noticed that Shanshan has been slacking off in her cultivation recently. She’s been punished and put into confinement."<br/>
<br/>
"What?! Miss Lin sacrificed too much for me," Ning Zhuo exclaimed, visibly concerned.<br/>
<br/>
It was clear that Lao De had specifically come to intercept Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"You don’t need to see her today. Just leave," Lao De said, issuing a dismissal.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo bowed and inquired about Lin Shanshan’s condition, but Lao De responded with mocking remarks. Seeing no other choice, Ning Zhuo left.<br/>
<br/>
Many eyes watched him as he left, and only after his figure disappeared from sight did the cultivators withdraw their gazes.<br/>
<br/>
"This guy is so ordinary. Why is our junior sister so obsessed with him? I don’t get it," one of the disciples grumbled.<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, I can’t stand guys like him. Not much skill, but they’re slick with words," another added.<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, now that the junior sister is in confinement, let’s tally up how much debt she’s incurred while gathering resources for Ning Zhuo. As her senior brothers, let’s pool our money and pay off her debts to the elders."<br/>
<br/>
"It feels wrong somehow," one muttered.<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, it’s like we’re covering for Ning Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
"Let’s make him pay!"<br/>
<br/>
"We can’t. He’s not just some random guy; he’s from a powerful cultivation family. He favored by a Golden Core patriarch. If we provoke him, it could hurt our sect’s cooperation with the Ning family."<br/>
<br/>
"But I can’t stomach this!"<br/>
<br/>
"None of us can. But she’s our junior sister."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, she’s really lost her mind this time."<br/>
<br/>
"I think she’s been completely bewitched by Ning Zhuo. I really feel bad for our Senior Brother!"<br/>
<br/>
"If Senior Brother weren’t stuck guarding the Demon Cave, Ning Zhuo would never have had the chance!"<br/>
<br/>
The more they discussed, the more upset they became.<br/>
<br/>
"We need to teach Ning Zhuo a lesson, or I won’t be able to sleep."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, even though his family is far away, we can always stir up trouble by inciting the foreign cultivators."<br/>
<br/>
"Great idea!"<br/>
<br/>
After returning to his cave, Ning Zhuo quickly received a report from Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong relayed the entire conversation between Lin Shanshan’s senior brothers, which he had overheard by controlling the Ten Thousand Li Dragon. Ning Zhuo had pretended to leave earlier but secretly planted the dragon in the nearby forest, allowing Sun Lingtong to eavesdrop on Lao De.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed:  <br/>
"Miss Lin has indeed sacrificed a lot for me. I will repay her in the future."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, arms behind his head, pondered:  <br/>
"So, those cultivators plan to come after us. What should we do?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled:  <br/>
"They intend to use the foreign cultivators to suppress me. It’s not a bad plan."  <br/>
"Plus, I defeated Chang Yan so quickly that many aren’t convinced."  <br/>
"It’s likely that more foreign cultivators, or even powerful ones, will challenge me soon."  <br/>
"This is actually a good thing. It’ll give me a chance to hone my combat skills."  <br/>
"But without sparring partners, it’s a bit frustrating."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo glanced at Sun Lingtong:  <br/>
"What do you think of Han Zhou?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong replied:  <br/>
"His martial arts are quite fierce and complement his cultivation technique."<br/>
<br/>
"Let’s go talk to him," Ning Zhuo said with a smile, standing up.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, Ning Zhuo met with Han Zhou, who looked puzzled by his visit.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Han, shall we go inside to talk?" Ning Zhuo suggested.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou had no objections and welcomed Ning Zhuo into his cave.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shared his insights on the Bitter Cold Sutra, which Han Zhou practiced.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou’s eyes widened in delight:  <br/>
"Ning Zhuo has great insight! He’s grasped many aspects of the Bitter Cold Sutra."  <br/>
"This is fantastic!"<br/>
<br/>
"If I can win him over, I’ll complete much of my contract."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the opportunity, Ning Zhuo proposed a sparring match at the training ground. Han Zhou readily agreed!<br/>
