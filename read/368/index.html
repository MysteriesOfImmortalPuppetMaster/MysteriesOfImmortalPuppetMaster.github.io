<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Standing inside the spiritual plant cabin, Ning Zhuo first activated the cabin's formation. This formation came standard with the Ten Thousand Li Dragon's Journeyâ€”a basic setup that provided spiritual power and included spatial compression abilities, allowing for a massive amount of space to be folded into the cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo began to set up a new formation, expanding upon this basic one. He placed several Eight Trigram Stones at the key points and used a stylus to carve intricate formation patterns, eventually embedding a Heavenly Jade Stone as the core, with various spirit jades forming the energy nodes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This was the Eight Trigram Return Wind Formation. He arranged the spirit jades according to the Eight Trigram positions. Once the formation was activated, a whirlwind of spiritual energy immediately formed inside the cabin. From now on, Ning Zhuo could control the flow of spiritual energy within the cabin. He adjusted the formation for a long time until he reached a satisfactory state where streams of energy circulated steadily, with the energy points fixed in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"This is the prototype of an artificial spiritual vein!" Ning Zhuo said with a sense of accomplishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He continued building. Taking out a large amount of Xuanhuang Earth, he filled the cabin with it. The soil quickly piled up to his waist, but Ning Zhuo activated the cabin's base formation, causing the space inside the soil to compress and fold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The soil level rapidly dropped to his ankles. Ning Zhuo paused the compression, poured more soil, and repeated the process three times until the soil reached the required standard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Next, he took out the precious Three-Treasure Spirit Earth. This particular soil was extraordinary, created from a combination of the Heavenly Treasure Purple Cloud Wind, the Earth Treasure Magma Blood, and the Human Treasure Heroâ€™s Ash. After careful refinement and rituals, the soil had become extremely valuable. Even in the Myriad Medicine Sect, only top-tier medicinal plants required such soil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Thanks to Lin Shanshan, Ning Zhuo, an outsider, had managed to obtain this rare treasureâ€”something nearly impossible to find even in large immortal cities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo first dug a pit, placed the Three-Treasure Spirit Earth into it, and then spread Five-Colored Divine Sand evenly over the soil. From a bottle hidden in his robes, he carefully poured Milky Way Spiritual Liquid into the pit. The liquid shimmered with starlight, mesmerizing to behold, as it moistened the soil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo patiently waited. After a while, he crouched down, using his divine sense to inspect the soil's condition. Finding it still somewhat dry, he cautiously poured in more Milky Way Spiritual Liquid, adding only a small amount each time until it reached the perfect state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He had Sun Lingtong come over to check as well, to ensure he hadnâ€™t missed anything or made a mistake on his first attempt. Sun Lingtong didnâ€™t have deep knowledge in this area, so he compared the pit to his experience in stealing spiritual plants, noting that the pit resembled the ones left behind after uprooting them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"It feels just right!" he said to Ning Zhuo upon returning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo understood that Sun Lingtong's affirmation was more of a reassurance than an expert opinion. After double-checking everything to ensure that every detail met the standards, Ning Zhuo planted the Spirit Concealing Willow in the pit. He then filled in the soil and compacted it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He reactivated the Eight Trigram Return Wind Formation, carefully adjusting the streams of spiritual energy around the Spirit Concealing Willow. Three streams of energy circulated through the soil, nourishing the treeâ€™s roots, while two others flowed through its trunk and branches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">At this point, the spiritual energy surrounding the Spirit Concealing Willow was far more concentrated than before, but it still lacked a natural feel. A key aspect of cultivating spiritual plants is mimicking the natural environment, especially in the initial stages. The dense energy streams didn't disperse naturally, so Ning Zhuo set up a second formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Soon, both the second and third formations were complete. Once activated, a gentle spring breeze blew, accelerating the dispersal of the energy streams, while melodious sounds, reminiscent of birds chirping, filled the air. These formations used the Three-Mile Spring Breeze and Pleasant Melody.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The willow's branches swayed gently in the breeze, as though enjoying the rare peace and comfort. Under the nourishment of abundant spiritual energy, the leaves gleamed with a jade-like luster, even more radiant than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong sighed in admiration:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">"This environment is so niceâ€”I almost want to move in here to sleep!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">Ning Zhuo shook his head.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Itâ€™s better to leave this space for the Spirit Concealing Willow."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">"Weâ€™ve consumed a lot of its energy recently. Letâ€™s allow it to rest and recover its full vitality as soon as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">After finishing his work, Ning Zhuo was exhausted. He slept soundly, and the next day, he headed to Yuanshan Mountain to meet Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">However, he was intercepted at the foot of the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">"Youâ€™re Ning Zhuo, right?" The cultivator blocking his path was a short man named Lao De, a Foundation Establishment disciple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">"Ah, Senior Brother Lao. Yes, I am Ning Zhuo," Ning Zhuo replied with a smile, politely greeting him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Lao De crossed his arms and scanned Ning Zhuo from head to toe with a disdainful look:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Who gave you permission to call me 'Senior Brother'? Youâ€™re not even part of the Myriad Medicine Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Daoist Lao," Ning Zhuo calmly corrected himself, keeping his tone respectful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Lao De snorted:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">"Iâ€™m Shanshanâ€™s third senior brother. Do you know that sheâ€™s been running around with you lately, neglecting her cultivation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Ning Zhuo immediately became serious:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"I deeply appreciate Miss Linâ€™s help and will never forget it. I will certainly repay her in the future!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Lao De waved dismissively:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">"Enough with your promises of future repayment. The Sect Master has already noticed that Shanshan has been slacking off in her cultivation recently. Sheâ€™s been punished and put into confinement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">"What?! Miss Lin sacrificed too much for me," Ning Zhuo exclaimed, visibly concerned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">It was clear that Lao De had specifically come to intercept Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">"You donâ€™t need to see her today. Just leave," Lao De said, issuing a dismissal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Ning Zhuo bowed and inquired about Lin Shanshanâ€™s condition, but Lao De responded with mocking remarks. Seeing no other choice, Ning Zhuo left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">Many eyes watched him as he left, and only after his figure disappeared from sight did the cultivators withdraw their gazes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">"This guy is so ordinary. Why is our junior sister so obsessed with him? I donâ€™t get it," one of the disciples grumbled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">"Hmph, I canâ€™t stand guys like him. Not much skill, but theyâ€™re slick with words," another added.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">"Alright, now that the junior sister is in confinement, letâ€™s tally up how much debt sheâ€™s incurred while gathering resources for Ning Zhuo. As her senior brothers, letâ€™s pool our money and pay off her debts to the elders."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">"It feels wrong somehow," one muttered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">"Yeah, itâ€™s like weâ€™re covering for Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">"Letâ€™s make him pay!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">"We canâ€™t. Heâ€™s not just some random guy; heâ€™s from a powerful cultivation family. He favored by a Golden Core patriarch. If we provoke him, it could hurt our sectâ€™s cooperation with the Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">"But I canâ€™t stomach this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">"None of us can. But sheâ€™s our junior sister."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">"Sigh, sheâ€™s really lost her mind this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">"I think sheâ€™s been completely bewitched by Ning Zhuo. I really feel bad for our Senior Brother!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">"If Senior Brother werenâ€™t stuck guarding the Demon Cave, Ning Zhuo would never have had the chance!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">The more they discussed, the more upset they became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">"We need to teach Ning Zhuo a lesson, or I wonâ€™t be able to sleep."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">"Yes, even though his family is far away, we can always stir up trouble by inciting the foreign cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">"Great idea!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">After returning to his cave, Ning Zhuo quickly received a report from Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Sun Lingtong relayed the entire conversation between Lin Shanshanâ€™s senior brothers, which he had overheard by controlling the Ten Thousand Li Dragon. Ning Zhuo had pretended to leave earlier but secretly planted the dragon in the nearby forest, allowing Sun Lingtong to eavesdrop on Lao De.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">Ning Zhuo sighed:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Miss Lin has indeed sacrificed a lot for me. I will repay her in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong, arms behind his head, pondered:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">"So, those cultivators plan to come after us. What should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Ning Zhuo smiled:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"They intend to use the foreign cultivators to suppress me. Itâ€™s not a bad plan."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">"Plus, I defeated Chang Yan so quickly that many arenâ€™t convinced."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Itâ€™s likely that more foreign cultivators, or even powerful ones, will challenge me soon."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">"This is actually a good thing. Itâ€™ll give me a chance to hone my combat skills."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"But without sparring partners, itâ€™s a bit frustrating."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo glanced at Sun Lingtong:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">"What do you think of Han Zhou?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Sun Lingtong replied:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"His martial arts are quite fierce and complement his cultivation technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Letâ€™s go talk to him," Ning Zhuo said with a smile, standing up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Soon, Ning Zhuo met with Han Zhou, who looked puzzled by his visit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Brother Han, shall we go inside to talk?" Ning Zhuo suggested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Han Zhou had no objections and welcomed Ning Zhuo into his cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo shared his insights on the Bitter Cold Sutra, which Han Zhou practiced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Han Zhouâ€™s eyes widened in delight:  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">"Ning Zhuo has great insight! Heâ€™s grasped many aspects of the Bitter Cold Sutra."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"This is fantastic!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"If I can win him over, Iâ€™ll complete much of my contract."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Seeing the opportunity, Ning Zhuo proposed a sparring match at the training ground. Han Zhou readily agreed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
