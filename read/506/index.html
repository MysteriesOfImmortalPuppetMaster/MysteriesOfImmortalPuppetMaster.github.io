<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">When Ning Zhuo heard Song Ji’s comments, his heart stirred slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">His first thought was not of the Dice Bone Demon God, but of the Marrow of the Void Demon God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Though a Demigod was merely at the Golden Core level, the Marrow of the Void Demon God was of the Soul Formation level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“The marrow was the greatest benefit I gained from expending my fortune!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Before reaching Bi Kong Mountain, I also impersonated the Old Monster in the Stone and robbed the transport convoy of the Two Notes Country, acquiring countless military supplies. Even now, that storage pouch at the treasure-grade level remains unopened.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“There must be many good things inside!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Furthermore, I later used talismans to teleport to the Red Flower Camp, assisting Mu Lan in killing Di Lu and driving away the Cang Yue Ancient God. This military merit also counts as my gain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Calculating it all… hiss…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo couldn’t help but secretly draw a cold breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The more he tallied this muddled account of fortune, the more alarmed he became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This surge of powerful fortune had brought him too many benefits, and even after the fierce battle at Moon Hook Mountain, much of it still lingered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“How immense must this fortune have been initially?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Who was so kind as to secretly support me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“If I ever get the chance to find them in the future, I must repay them in some way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">To this day, Ning Zhuo still did not know the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Song Ji’s divination also verified Ning Zhuo’s earlier suspicions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“My fortune is currently declining. I must keep this change firmly in mind. If I grow complacent or rely on my strong fortune, I might suffer a blow.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Thus, humility and caution remain the best strategies for navigating the world and conducting oneself over the long term.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“I must continue maintaining these excellent habits!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo silently reminded himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Upon learning of Ning Zhuo’s fate, Du Tiechuan set aside some of his hidden worries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He spoke calmly: “Song Ji, take Ning Zhuo away and interrogate him for detailed information about the enemy’s internal affairs.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Hearing this, Ning Zhuo immediately stood up and clasped his fists: “Commander Du. In this recent battle, I assisted General Mu Lan in killing one Nascent Soul cultivator, repelling another, and gaining some military merit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Now, with a major battle imminent, if I could use my merits to withdraw some rare elixirs in advance to enhance my physical foundation, it would allow me to serve the army more effectively!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Hmm?” Du Tiechuan raised his eyes to look at Ning Zhuo, his gaze stern and displeased. “My military governance has always been strict in rewards and punishments, applied uniformly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“According to military discipline, now is not the time for awarding merits.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“The entire army —including myself and all soldiers —must strictly adhere to this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“This is no trivial matter! If I agree, it would undoubtedly corrupt the kingdom’s systems, harm military discipline, be unfair to other officers, shake morale, weaken fighting spirit, and cause immense harm.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly: “Commander, it’s just withdrawing some elixirs to enhance my physical foundation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Your Excellency may already be aware of my situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“As you can see, I am merely at the Foundation Establishment stage. Charging into battle carries too great a risk.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“If my physical body could advance rapidly in a short time, I would surely add a quasi-Nascent Soul level combat strength to our army!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Du Tiechuan shook his head slightly, his expression icy: “How much benefit could a mere quasi-Nascent Soul level bring to the overall war situation?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Speak no more of this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Leave!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo had no choice but to salute: “As you command, I take my leave.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Song Ji saluted and prepared to follow him out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Du Tiechuan sent a psychic message, communicating privately: “Who granted Ning Zhuo such powerful fortune? Can you divine it, Song Ji?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Song Ji replied covertly: “Extremely difficult.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“I, too, find it strange.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“By normal principles, such vast external fortune would require the caster to pay an enormous price.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“Who would sacrifice so much to prop up Ning Zhuo?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Even if he were a favored scion of a great clan, such support would be excessive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Additionally, there is another oddity.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Du Tiechuan: “Oh?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Song Ji continued: “Normally, externally bestowed fortune of this kind would be consumed violently and could not last.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“But my recent divination shows that the fortune on Ning Zhuo is not being consumed so fiercely.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“In fact, there are even signs of recent nourishment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Du Tiechuan pressed: “Why is that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Song Ji shook his head: “Fortune is an obscure study; my knowledge is but superficial. Methods to nourish external fortune are bizarre and varied. I cannot judge.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Du Tiechuan: “Then let it be.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Next, I must trouble you to thoroughly probe the enemy’s situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“With your methods, I trust you will detect any concealment from the Dice Bone Demon God or Ning Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Song Ji immediately accepted the order, vowing to spare no effort in executing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Song Ji led Ning Zhuo alone to a tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo released the Dice Bone Demon God: “Old Dice, you must speak all you know without reservation. But if it concerns your own safety, do not force yourself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo specially instructed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Dice Bone Demon God said: “Master, this old servant was never close to those from Thousand Peaks Forest. All I know, I have already told you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo nodded: “Now, repeat it here in front of Lord Song.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He then sent a psychic message to Song Ji: “I must trouble you to cast detection spells to prevent the Dice Bone Demon God from misleading our army with false information.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“To be honest, my subduing him was entirely coincidental.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“Even now, I remain somewhat uneasy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Seeing Ning Zhuo’s proactive request, Song Ji openly employed numerous divination methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After the time it took to drink two cups of tea, Song Ji escorted Ning Zhuo out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo, having failed to obtain body-enhancing elixirs from Du Tiechuan, showed no dejection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Returning to the Three Generals Camp, he briefly reported the situation to the three generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">All three generals sighed in relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhang Hei: “So we slipped through?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Guan Hong shook his head silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Liu Er said: “Shen Qinghe has been secretly following us. But since we subdued the Dice Bone Demon God and returned victorious, Commander Du, for the greater good, has not settled accounts with us yet.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“From my understanding of Du Tiechuan, this reckoning will come eventually.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo nodded, agreeing with Liu Er’s analysis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Among the three generals, Liu Er was the most astute in discerning others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After bidding farewell to the generals, Ning Zhuo returned to his tent, entered the Mechanical Wandering Dragon, and resumed crafting mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong watched and learned, gaining much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">By the next afternoon, Sun Lingtong could operate one of the mechanical platforms, saving Ning Zhuo considerable time and effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo entered the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, enveloped in thick stone skin via the Great Arts Of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing, to enhance his physical foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Late at night, he broke free of the stone skin and resumed his relentless work repairing Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Though these Golden Core-level puppets had been split into pieces, their spiritual cores remained intact, making repairs manageable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“The effect is truly remarkable, boss!” After his first cultivation session, Ning Zhuo clenched his fists, feeling unprecedented power brewing within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He praised Sun Lingtong sincerely: “To invent this cultivation method, boss, you’re a genius!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Sun Lingtong, overjoyed, planted his hands on his hips and laughed heartily: “Of course! I am your boss, Little Zhuo!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">After several days of cultivation, Commander Du issued a new order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He commanded the Red Flower Camp, Three Generals Camp, and other troops to relocate several miles outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He then ordered the dismantling of Woodwheel Town’s walls, replacing them with defensive lines formed by a dozen armies, and commenced large-scale construction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Logistical units—array masters, artifact smiths, and even a few mechanic masters—collaborated, employing diverse methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">With ample resources, hundreds of cultivators worked day and night, swiftly erecting the foundation of a colossal structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">As Du Tiechuan did not forbid observation, the project drew the entire army’s attention from the start.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Everyone wondered —what was the purpose of such a grand, lavish construction?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">At dusk, Ning Zhuo took a break to inspect the foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He saw a square, vast base, imposing even in its unfinished state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Built from Dragon Chant Stone, each block bore shifting dragon patterns. Pressing an ear to the stone revealed faint draconic roars, growing clearer and mightier as the structure expanded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The base was bordered by thick railings of Thunderbolt Iron, sturdy and capable of absorbing and storing lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">At the center stood a giant pillar topped with a basin-sized Dragon Soul Pearl. With his naked eye, Ning Zhuo saw a dragon soul swirling and roaring within the pearl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“Dragon Chant Stone is a dragon-vein material, refined over time by national energy. It’s an excellent medium for channeling a kingdom’s power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“The dragon soul within the pearl must have been at least Soul Formation level in life. Dragon souls best resonate with dragon-vein energy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“This seems like an altar to sacrifice a Soul Formation-level dragon soul?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“Truly a commander’s handiwork—grand from the outset!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo marveled before returning to cultivate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">In three days, his strength surged over tenfold, his skin now tough and resilient as if clad in artifact-grade armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Hearing the “altar” was 60% complete, with rampant speculation among the troops, he went to observe again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The structure now revealed a trapezoidal shape, still primarily Dragon Chant Stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Workers began laying Glazed Golden Light Tiles at the base—typically used in palaces, their radiance exuding regal majesty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo grew puzzled: “Using glazed tiles doesn’t fit an altar.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He noted eight pillars around the structure, each half the height of the central pillar. Their tops were carved with auspicious clouds and golden roc patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Squinting, Ning Zhuo discerned complex talismanic and formation patterns on the pillars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“At least eight defensive talismans and twelve auxiliary formation talismans.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“As for the formations… without seeing the whole, I can only detect four layers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Here, Ning Zhuo realized his formation knowledge was insufficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He remained calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“Though well-read, my studies were limited to clan schools and their public libraries.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“Among cultivation arts, formations are famed for complexity and depth.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“I’ve only scratched the surface —my accumulation here has just begun.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Though unclear on Du Tiechuan’s aim, Ning Zhuo knew the commander was investing heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“What is he planning?” The question echoed among all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Three days later, the structure was complete.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The trapezoidal platform stood flat-topped, centered on the dragon soul pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Surrounded by railings and eight golden roc pillars, activated formations fused the glazed tiles into a seamless whole. A dragon shadow from the pearl roamed the tiles, its vigorous form radiating power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Soldiers heard dragon roars resonating in their hearts —loud when focused on, faint otherwise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Two military banners flanked the central pillar, fluttering as formations harmonized, exuding awe-inspiring might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The answer was revealed: a Reviewing Platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The Dragon Shadow Nine Pillars Reviewing Platform!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The day after completion, Du Tiechuan ordered a military review.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The next day, fully armed, he stood atop the platform, activating military tactics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Looking down, he watched troops march past the platform. The Three Generals Camp and Red Flower Camp were among them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">As Military Adviser, Ning Zhuo rode beside the three generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">During the review, he felt layers of invisible force sweeping over him, accumulating relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">By the end, Ning Zhuo was drenched in sweat, muscles aching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Had he not enhanced his physique, he might have fallen from his horse in disgrace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Grateful, he also gleaned more of Du Tiechuan’s intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Others shared his deductions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">“So that’s it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">“The commander is deploying his trump card.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">“To think he’d use it before the battle even begins! How thrilling!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">“Iron Torrent Flattens the Plains! How many years has it been since he last used this move?”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
