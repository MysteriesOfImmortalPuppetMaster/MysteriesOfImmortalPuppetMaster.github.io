<div id="chapterContent">Ning Zhuo decided to investigate Shanxi Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt the spirit of adventure and immediately urged, "Little Zhuo, you cover me, I'll personally go to control—"<br/>
<br/>
The two first rode on the cloud, moving away from Cloud Concealment Mountain, and landed in a corner. Ning Zhuo then drew out the Ten Thousand Li Dragon from his waist. The eyes of the Ten Thousand Li Dragon emitted a strange light, enveloping Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Within this strange light, the forms of Sun and Ning rapidly shrunk. Following the light beam, after a few breaths, they entered into the Ten Thousand Li Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
A moment later, the two piloted the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, returning to Cloud Concealment Mountain once again.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong smirked. The Ten Thousand Li Dragon could change sizes and conceal its aura, allowing them to explore safely while inside it.<br/>
<br/>
"But this isn't fun at all," Sun Lingtong sighed, glancing at Ning Zhuo who was seriously controlling the mechanism beside him. "Little Zhuo is good at everything, just a bit too cautious."<br/>
<br/>
As they gradually entered the Shanxi Valley, the sunlight was gradually swallowed by the tall mountain walls, and the surroundings gradually became cold and gloomy.<br/>
<br/>
Moss covered the rocks, dampness permeated the air, and the soil was dark. Steep cliffs towered, ancient trees intertwined, and when the mountain wind blew, the branches and leaves made a faint rustling sound, as if whispering softly.<br/>
<br/>
As the Ten Thousand Li Dragon went deeper into the area, the light and shadows became more complex. The heavy, rich scent of soil seemed to block one's nose and mouth, giving a suffocating feeling.<br/>
<br/>
The mottled tree shadows became increasingly strange, mist curled around the forest, creating an eerie, demon-like atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
"Look there!" Sun Lingtong pointed to a spot.<br/>
<br/>
In the image created by the spell, there was a patch of white, bare ground.<br/>
<br/>
As the Ten Thousand Li Dragon stealthily approached, they discovered it was actually a bone burial pile, covering quite a large area. A large number of animal carcasses, as well as human skeletons, were randomly piled up.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo scanned it with a glance and immediately found hundreds of human skeletons, his expression becoming solemn.<br/>
This was just what was visible on the surface of the pile, there must be even more human remains inside the pile!<br/>
<br/>
"This is a sign of some demonic technique being practiced. There's at least one demonic cultivator here!" Ning Zhuo said after examining these human bones.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong analyzed, "There are many Foundation Establishment level demon beasts in the pile. The demonic cultivator here is quite powerful, at least at the Golden Core level."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned slightly: "If a demonic cultivator is hiding here, logically, if the Fox God couldn't handle it himself, she should have reported it to the Tiger God. Why did she give us these clues?"<br/>
<br/>
He controlled the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, like a small insect, very inconspicuous, flying close to the ground among the weeds, continuing to go deeper.<br/>
<br/>
As they approached the bottom of the valley, he saw two guards.<br/>
One was a coiled large python, the other was a lying gray wolf.<br/>
<br/>
The aura leaking from both of them was at the Foundation Establishment level. The gray wolf's eyes were alert, its eyes emitting light, while the python kept flicking out its tongue, also seeming to be using some demonic technique to detect the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
Mere demon beasts couldn't do these things, these two were both demon cultivators!<br/>
Although they hadn't transformed into human form, they had mastered demonic techniques, making them several times more threatening than ordinary demon beasts.<br/>
Ning Zhuo drove the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, concealing their aura, brazenly walking right in front of the two demon cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the bottom of the valley, a large number of demon cultivators were cultivating, fighting, and eating here. There were wolves, snakes, tigers, leopards, bears, wild boars, and so on, with various appearances and forms.<br/>
<br/>
The air was filled with a foul stench.<br/>
<br/>
On a high platform lay a black tiger as huge as an elephant.<br/>
<br/>
The black tiger was muscular and robust, breathing heavily. Its breath was strong, each exhalation could stir up a whirlwind.<br/>
<br/>
As the saying goes, "Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger." From the whirlwind accompanying it, one could glimpse a corner of the fierce tiger's strength.<br/>
<br/>
"A Golden Core level black tiger demon cultivator, why does it feel a bit familiar?" Sun Lingtong frowned and said.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo spoke: "The Night Tiger Mountain God."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suddenly realized: "Right, they look so alike!"<br/>
<br/>
But obviously, the two were not the same tiger.<br/>
<br/>
The physical body of the Tiger God had died of old age hundreds of years ago. In order to linger in the mortal world, it had transformed into a deity.<br/>
<br/>
In comparison, the adult black tiger before them had a fresh, active physical body, with a very young life force, like the sun at noon, giving a feeling between youth and prime.<br/>
<br/>
The black tiger slowly opened its eyes and suddenly growled in a low voice: "Where's my blood food?"<br/>
<br/>
"Coming, coming, Great King!" A human cultivator came running out of a cave.<br/>
<br/>
His face was smeared with black, his clothes were tattered, and he held a corpse storage bag, turning the mouth of the bag downwards and pouring out a large number of corpses.<br/>
<br/>
The black tiger opened its blood-red mouth, emitting a suction force, and swallowed many corpses into its mouth, continuously chewing.<br/>
<br/>
Its strong jaw trembled slightly, sharp teeth tightly biting into fresh chunks of meat. The meat was torn and chewed into pieces in its mouth. With each chew, the friction between muscle and bone produced a low sound, and the sound of bones breaking was constant.<br/>
<br/>
Blood leaked from between the black tiger's teeth, then flowed down along its chin.<br/>
A strong smell of blood quickly spread.<br/>
<br/>
The fierce beast demon cultivators who smelled the blood instinctively gathered around the high platform, watching the black tiger eat with eager eyes, all showing desire.<br/>
<br/>
After eating three-tenths of the corpses, the black tiger's belly was visibly swollen, and it activated its technique to digest.<br/>
The demonic technique - Flesh and Blood Devouring Technique!<br/>
Both Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong recognized it.<br/>
<br/>
The Flesh and Blood Devouring Technique was a widely spread demonic technique that enhanced one's physical body by devouring the blood and flesh of other lives, making one's muscles more powerful and blood essence more vigorous.<br/>
<br/>
As the demonic technique was activated, the black tiger's belly visibly shrank at a rapid speed, quickly returning to normal.<br/>
It continued to devour, eating another three-tenths before repeating the process, activating the technique to cultivate.<br/>
<br/>
After finishing cultivation, the black tiger let out a satisfied burp and lazily said: "Divide the rest among yourselves."<br/>
<br/>
Given permission, the demon cultivators howled and screeched, pouncing towards the pile of corpses, feasting heartily.<br/>
<br/>
For a time, the demon beasts pushed and shoved, rushing forward, falling into a fight over the blood food. In the chaos, the smell of blood spread even further.<br/>
<br/>
The black tiger raised its eyes, listening to the clamor, enjoying the fight among its subordinates.<br/>
Several weak demon cultivators accidentally exposed weaknesses while fighting for food and were ambushed and severely injured.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, the surrounding demon cultivators marked them as their new prey. Driven by hunger and greed, they launched a merciless encirclement, treating their companions as food to satisfy their hunger.<br/>
<br/>
The only human cultivator watched with a face full of fear and disgust, shrinking his body, standing beside the black tiger for protection. However, he clearly didn't trust it too much, fearing that if he annoyed the black tiger, it might kill him with a single swipe.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo witnessed all this, their faces cold.<br/>
<br/>
"A Golden Core level Night Tiger demon cultivator, along with many demon cultivators, mainly at the Foundation Establishment level." Ning Zhuo estimated the strength of this group of demon cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
"We can kill them all!" Sun Lingtong gritted his teeth, his eyes showing a hateful light, "Any beast that eats humans should die!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo knew the reason.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's former village had been raided and massacred by demon cultivators. At that time, he was very lucky to have been picked up by his master.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said: "Although the black tiger demon is at the Golden Core level, I've gotten several bottles of strange poison from Yang Chanyu. One of them is colorless and odorless, and can be put into corpses. When it devours the corpses and activates its technique, hehe, there will surely be a good show!"<br/>
<br/>
"With our preparation against their unpreparedness, we do have a chance of winning!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned slightly: "Boss, let's not act hastily, let me think for a moment."<br/>
<br/>
He put his hands behind his back, paced back and forth in the dragon head cabin a few times, then made a decision: "Let's spare this demon's life for now, we need to investigate more about the situation."<br/>
<br/>
"Huh?" Sun Lingtong raised his eyebrows, "What do you have in mind?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, half comforting and half explaining, said: "Boss, think about it, how could a Golden Core level black tiger demon have hidden for so long?"<br/>
<br/>
"It eats so much in one meal, and the consumption of the demonic technique is extremely large. If it were to plunder on Cloud Concealment Mountain, it would surely have a huge impact."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong immediately understood Ning Zhuo's meaning and continued: "However, Cloud Concealment Mountain has no signs of demonic presences. It's completely harmonious. When they had entered Cloud Concealment Village, they hadn’t heard anything about villagers being slaughtered en masse. This indicated that this group of demon beasts deliberately held back, not eating the grass close to home, but went out to plunder elsewhere."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "So, they must have caused disturbances elsewhere. We just don't know about it yet. It's possible they've already made it onto the wanted list."<br/>
<br/>
"If we attack rashly, there are quite a few risks. Why don't we go check the wanted list first, gather some intelligence, then come back to act? Wouldn't that give us a better chance?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded: "That makes sense."<br/>
Although he was eager, he knew the importance of the situation and wouldn't risk losing the big picture for small gains.<br/>
After their discussion, they controlled the Ten Thousand Li Dragon to leave Cloud Concealment Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo activated the mechanism's ability to traverse space, and they quickly arrived at Yugang Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Yugang Mountain stood tall and majestic. Because it was rich in jade-moistened divine steel, even the soil showed a jade-like color. From afar, the entire mountain body appeared lush and verdant, as if a giant had put on a jade robe.<br/>
<br/>
Mountain streams gurgled, sounding like the gentle plucking of an ancient zither. The mountain rocks were hard and sparkling, all with a jade-like luster. The mountain body had been excavated many times, revealing multiple open-air ore beds.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, inside the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, looked down and saw many miners, like ants, working hard in the ore beds, tirelessly digging.<br/>
<br/>
The ore beds and mountain body were densely covered with mine tunnels of various sizes. The deep mine passages were intricate and complex, like a huge web extending deep into the mountain's interior.<br/>
<br/>
Halfway up the mountain, there was a small town.<br/>
<br/>
The town was surrounded by a circle of high walls, equipped with mechanized watchtowers, with a large number of cultivators guarding various key locations at all times.<br/>
<br/>
The town had many large open-air furnaces constantly refining ore, causing thick smoke to roll continuously, never dissipating.<br/>
Sun and Ning left the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, disguised themselves, pretending to be two middle-aged wandering cultivators, one tall and one short. They entered the mountain town together.<br/>
<br/>
The guards at the main gate immediately stopped the two: "The price list is posted there, look it over and pay before you can enter the town."<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, the guards took Sun and Ning for wandering cultivators who had come to Yugang Mountain to mine.<br/>
Sun and Ning came to the foot of the city wall and saw the price list posted on the wall.<br/>
The price list was quite detailed, stating: Fifty low-grade spirit stones allow mining in the first underground level of the ore bed, with a time limit of…<br/>
