<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 470: The Hero Returns Again</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was now once again coiled around Ning Zhuo’s waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Most of the spoils inside had already been sold off, exchanged for spirit stones that filled several cabins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Now, Ning Zhuo no longer needed to worry about the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon’s cost of traveling through the void—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He was very wealthy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Sun Lingtong, looking very small, sat cross-legged on the ground, wearing the generals-and-soldiers-shared-helmet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The large helmet sat atop his small head. The back half of the helmet covered a small portion of Sun Lingtong’s upper back, making the disparity between them quite evident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong’s physical foundation was far more robust than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Although the helmet was heavy, he could easily support it with his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">While supporting the helmet, he flipped through the military manual “Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings” in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This military manual was tattered and incomplete. Sun Lingtong, who had no real mastery of military strategy, knew the characters, but found them hard to understand when combined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">As he read further, the strategic content became more profound. Misunderstanding even one character could lead to a completely different outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The key point was that the manual had many gaps, missing numerous words, and sometimes even large sections of text.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This piece of military treasure was excellent for use in battle, but as teaching material, it truly put the reader in a difficult position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But now, the situation was different—Sun Lingtong had put on the generals-and-soldiers-shared-helmet!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">As he continued flipping through the pages, his divine sense delved into the manual. His eyes became unfocused as he fell into a state of comprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In a daze, he became an ordinary soldier in the army, his steps heavy and slow. During a nighttime sneak attack, he suddenly could not help letting out a loud fart. This caused the enemy to discover them, and the entire ambush failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Then he became a small leader. His temper was irritable. Although he had infiltrated close to the enemy, he could not restrain himself and charged too early, attacking at the wrong time, causing the enemy to react collectively and withstand the ambush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He even became the main general. He was hesitant and timid. Clearly, he had seized the timing for the sneak attack and had drawn close to the enemy, but he dared not go all-in, not attacking with full force at the crucial moment. By the time he wanted to give it his all, the enemy had stabilized their formation, and it was too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sun Lingtong gained various insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“To succeed in a sneak attack, as a soldier one must hide one’s tracks, as a leader one must endure and hold back, and as a general one must have decisiveness! At the very moment of the ambush, you must go all out and commit everything. Only this way can the sneak attack achieve maximum effectiveness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It took a full two hours before Sun Lingtong slowly opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">His divine sense was nearly exhausted. He put down the helmet, stood up again, raised his eyebrows at Ning Zhuo, looking proud, obviously having gained a lot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“I have comprehended a battle formation called the ‘Light Breeze of Thieves Formation.’”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“This formation allows the soldiers to march quickly, as if treading on a light breeze. At the same time, it can conceal their tracks.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“By hiding and disguising, after getting close to the enemy army, you then launch a fierce, full-scale ambush!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Like a gentle breeze brushing one’s face, it steals the enemy’s lives. It is especially adept at fighting after the enemy has fallen asleep!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After Sun Lingtong finished sharing, Ning Zhuo became somewhat doubtful: “That’s it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He had thought he would see a lot of content, but in fact, there was only one battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong stroked his chin and analyzed, “Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings are too fragmented and broken. It’s difficult to understand through normal reading.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“My own knowledge of military strategy is basically zero, which only makes the situation worse.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“As for the power of the generals-and-soldiers-shared-helmet, it allows the wearer to gain the experience of the soldiers and generals who once wore it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Combining the two, based on my own nature and preferences, I can receive the correct guidance, thus summarizing a result that is most suitable for me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“It’s clear that my result is the Light Breeze of Thieves Formation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly, expressing agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Sun Lingtong’s outlook was broader than Ning Zhuo’s, especially in terms of practical experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Sun Lingtong’s thinking was also very meticulous. He deduced the truth after just one attempt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Little Zhuo, you give it a try,” Sun Lingtong suggested, “I’ve tested it for you, so there should be no risk.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Boss, thank you very much.” Ning Zhuo had long been interested. Before entering the camp, he imitated Sun Lingtong’s earlier state, sat cross-legged on the ground, and began to comprehend the military strategy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He became a soldier escorting many civilians. Because of this burden, not only he himself, but the entire army was wiped out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He became a small leader who refused to abandon wounded comrades. While dragging them to escape, he was overtaken and killed by the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He became the main general, who could not bear casualties and was unwilling to abandon certain troops. He continually committed the reserve units, and as a result, in the latter stages of the war, the front line, without any reserves, could not hold. Once a corner collapsed, the entire line quickly fell apart. Ning Zhuo, as the main general, also lost the battle and died.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Thus, Ning Zhuo comprehended a military strategy —the Law of Absolute Annihilation by Sacrificing Comrades in Death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Once this method is employed, it can use the flesh and souls of one’s comrades as materials, all sacrificed to exchange for temporary power to strengthen those who remain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Therefore, the more comrades die, the stronger the increase in combat power for those who survive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Seeing Ning Zhuo’s weary expression as he opened his eyes, Sun Lingtong asked curiously, “Little Zhuo, what have you comprehended this time?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo: …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He was silent for a moment before saying, “I have comprehended a military strategy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Sun Lingtong pressed, “What strategy?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“It must follow your character, according to your tastes, something that suits you best.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo: …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Boss, if you hadn’t said that, we’d still be good friends!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Seeing that Ning Zhuo remained silent for a long time, Sun Lingtong was driven by curiosity, “Aiya, Little Zhuo, hurry up and tell me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo could only nod and reluctantly say, “This military strategy is called… The Hero's Return Technique!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“What does that mean?” Sun Lingtong was puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo recited softly, “As it is said, ‘The wind is bleak, the Yi River cold; once the hero leaves, he never returns.’”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“This military strategy allows the hero to return.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“When comrades fight shoulder to shoulder, if a hero dies on the battlefield, the remainder of his strength will bless those who remain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Though the hero may die, his remaining strength still assists his comrades in battle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“I really like this military strategy. It fully reflects my understanding of the cruelty of war. War is vicious and dangerous, and I love peace even more!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“At the same time, this military strategy also aligns with my belief that any sacrifice must have value, and the higher the value, the more worthwhile the sacrifice.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Besides that, it also embodies my unyielding nature. Even in death, I must leave behind my remaining strength to continue fighting, showing persistence and courage!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong stared blankly at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo held his head high, chest out, smiling at him with righteous dignity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">For a moment, Sun Lingtong was really fooled, muttering, “I just feel like something’s not quite right.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo quickly said, “Huh, why think about that? Let’s head back first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Hm? Not continuing to comprehend it?” Sun Lingtong asked doubtfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo shook his head, “On one hand, we’ve already been away for a long time. Mu Lan’s side might have sudden changes. Staying guard is safer.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“On the other hand, since using Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings and the generals-and-soldiers-shared-helmet stems from our nature and preferences… of course, this claim still needs discussion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo quickly added a sentence, then continued, “Then, we must truly grasp a battle formation or a military strategy before we can better comprehend the second one, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“If we can’t fully digest it, the things we trigger will still contain much of the same content.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Sun Lingtong nodded, “Makes sense, makes sense. As expected of Little Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo smiled, “Of course, this is just a guess. But verifying it is very simple. We just need you, Boss, to comprehend it again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun Lingtong nodded, “Of course I’m going to do that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Immediately, Sun Lingtong remained inside the mechanical Dragon. Ning Zhuo, with the Dragon coiled around his waist, returned to the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Upon receiving the news, Liu Er immediately came out of his tent to greet him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Seeing Ning Zhuo’s face full of smiles, Liu Er’s own smile grew even warmer, “Seeing the military advisor as if bathed in a spring breeze, this trip must have brought great gains.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in salute, “My family has given me greater authority, and now I can provide more support to the Three Generals Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Liu Er happily clapped his hands, “Indeed, that’s good news! Military advisor, hurry inside my tent and have a seat.”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
