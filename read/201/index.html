<paragraph index="1">Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">In the Broad Ape Fruit Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Within the cave of the Nascent Soul-level Demon Ape, the icy mist gradually dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Jiufan slowly floated out from the thinning icy mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Seeing this scene, the Golden Core cultivators present were all excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"He’s out, he’s out!" Zheng Shuangjun shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The four Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou and Zheng families gathered around, expressing their gratitude and concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">His face was as pale as gold paper, his lips white, his entire being drained, like a piece of paper fluttering in the wind, extremely weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Brother Ning, you’ve really worked hard this time!" Zhu Xuanji was the first to step forward, immediately supporting Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Jiufan's body was still trembling slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He looked at Zhu Xuanji with vacant eyes, his eye sockets red, a mix of sorrow and joy as if he had survived a great ordeal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Zhu Xuanji also observed Ning Jiufan, seeing the sunken eye sockets and cheeks of the latter, he couldn't help but be secretly shocked: "How long has it been!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Their words were completely heartfelt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">If it weren’t for Ning Jiufan standing at the forefront, one of them might have become a sacrificial offering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Brother Ning, your righteousness! Your sacrifice and dedication this time will be remembered by all of us for life!" "You saved us all. This is a life-saving grace, and we will definitely repay it in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Jiufan sighed deeply: "I was also saving myself. After this battle, I hope that in the future, we can advance and retreat together, united in building a bright future." All the Golden Core cultivators nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Jiufan's great sacrifice elevated his status among the Golden Core cultivators, earning him immense influence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Zheng Shuangjun took out a portion of Nine Yang Yellow Ox Balm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He concernedly said to Ning Jiufan, "Brother Ning, you are extremely weak now, you should use some of our Zheng family's top-grade elixirs." Unexpectedly, Ning Jiufan's eye twitched fiercely upon seeing the Nine Yang Yellow Ox Balm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He suppressed his nausea, waving his hand repeatedly: "No, no, don’t let me see that elixir." "Alright, alright!" Zheng Shuangjun quickly put the balm away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Golden Core cultivators immediately understood that Ning Jiufan's injuries were not just physical but also psychological.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">His sacrifice was truly immense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This made everyone admire Ning Jiufan even more, generating a stronger sense of compensation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Next, everyone took out various miraculous elixirs, giving them to Ning Jiufan, almost feeding him water and medicine by hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The various miraculous elixirs had excellent effects, quickly stabilizing Ning Jiufan's aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">At this moment, the Nascent Soul-level Fire Fusion Demon Ape suddenly let out a low roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The overwhelming Nascent Soul-level aura made all the Golden Core cultivators and the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King outside the cave pause.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">By now, the icy mist had completely dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Nascent Soul-level Fire Fusion Demon Ape looked satisfied, it lay back down, its eyelids slowly closing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Before falling asleep, it extended a finger, shooting out a stream of blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The blood energy, like a meteor chasing the moon, moved extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, it landed on Ning Jiufan's forehead, marking a red mole between his brows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After completing this step, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape completely closed its eyes, falling into a deep sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Soon, it began to snore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Jiufan hurriedly reached out, touching his forehead, feeling the extremely condensed and stubborn blood energy, difficult to remove, his expression became very unsightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">It was clear that the Nascent Soul-level female ape had completely taken a liking to him, marking him with its unique sign.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">What was he supposed to do in the future?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The other Golden Core cultivators stared at the red mole on Ning Jiufan's forehead, each with a look of shock and astonishment, their hearts filled with intense fear and relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zhu Xuanji quickly transmitted his voice to comfort Ning Jiufan, promising to do his utmost to help him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The other Golden Core cultivators also expressed that Ning Jiufan's problem was everyone's problem! They would definitely assist him with all their might in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At this moment, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King, accompanied by several Golden Core-level Demon Apes, walked into the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The atmosphere inside the cave immediately became tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhu Xuanji stepped forward, standing in front of Ning Jiufan, facing the numerous Golden Core-level Fire Fusion Demon Apes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">However, the Fire Fusion Demon Apes, who had been roaring with anger and fighting to the death not long ago, showed no signs of battle intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Seeing the human Golden Core cultivators on high alert, they took a few steps back, raising their hands to indicate they had no intention of fighting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Then, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King pointed at Ning Jiufan, then raised its palm, letting out a series of roars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The several Golden Core-level Demon Apes behind it also clapped, gesticulating wildly, their faces full of admiration, with some even showing looks of worship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The human Golden Core cultivators looked at each other, then focused their gazes on Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Jiufan's face turned even more unsightly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The admiring gazes of the Fire Fusion Demon Apes, along with the clapping, felt like slaps on his face, making him extremely embarrassed and annoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zhu Xuanji and the others tried to keep a straight face, some frowning, some biting their tongues, some tensing their muscles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">After clapping for a while, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King pointed at Ning Jiufan again, then pointed at the cave entrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">It repeated this gesture three times, then led the Golden Core-level Demon Apes out of the cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The human Golden Core cultivators understood its meaning—it was inviting them out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhu Xuanji took the lead, walking at the forefront.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Zheng and Zhou family cultivators guarded Ning Jiufan, the great hero, in the middle of the group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The human Golden Core cultivators walked out of the cave, arriving at the previous battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Fire Fusion Demon Ape King waved its hand at the gathered Demon Apes, then let out a roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Foundation Establishment-level Demon Apes scattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Soon, only the Golden Core-level ones remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Fire Fusion Demon Ape King suddenly pounded its belly, then vomited out a stone ball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">It then grabbed the stone ball, with a reluctant expression, and handed it to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The legendary scene of the Demon Ape tribe rewarding a hero had occurred!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Zhu Xuanji's eyes flashed with golden light, immediately recognizing the stone ball, his expression stunned: "This is a Fire Core Pomegranate. Each pomegranate seed is an explosive talisman, capable of unleashing an attack comparable to a full-strength strike of an ordinary Golden Core." "But using it this way would be a waste!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"The pomegranate seeds can be used as fire cores, combined with other suitable fuels, to preserve special fire seeds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"I've never seen such a large pomegranate before. Even the royal treasury doesn't have such high-quality Fire Core Pomegranates." Without a doubt, this was an extremely rare heavenly material and earthly treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Upon hearing Zhu Xuanji's explanation, Ning Jiufan immediately reached out to take the pomegranate. After inspecting it, he took out a talisman, sticking it on the pomegranate's surface, then placed the pomegranate into his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhou Nongying couldn't help but feel fortunate: "I didn't expect the Ape King to have such a trump card. It seems we were lucky to avoid a deadly battle with the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King by accidentally entering the cave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family stared at the pomegranate, their gazes glued to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">They communicated privately: "These pomegranate seeds can be used in many ways for refining artifacts." "Indeed, I've already thought of at least thirty uses. Its effects must be excellent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">After giving the pomegranate, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King called out a few times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Three Golden Core-level subordinates immediately turned and left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After a dozen breaths, they returned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The leading Fire Fusion Demon Ape was holding a massive flame with both arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The flame was as large as a carriage, primarily deep red, but occasionally flickered with black. At the tip of the flame, black smoke often emanated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Earth Fiend Fire!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Such a large flame, it's a Nascent Soul-level resource!" The cultivators exclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Earth Fiend Fire not only had terrifying firepower and emitted high temperatures at all times, but it also possessed the intense toxicity of fire fiend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">It had limited use in alchemy, mainly for refining fire poison pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">But it could be used for artifact refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">This flame alone surpassed the capabilities of the Zheng family's top-tier artifact refining room in some aspects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family were mesmerized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">This flame was extremely tempting to them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Fire Fusion Demon Apes had no cultivation techniques, relying on their natural physical growth and constant tempering in nature to reach Golden Core-level combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">They had no spells to isolate the high temperature of the Earth Fiend Fire, only their special body structure to withstand it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Golden Core-level Demon Ape carrying the Earth Fiend Fire gradually couldn't bear it, its hands getting scorched, forcing it to pass the flame to its companion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The companion carried it for a while, but also couldn't endure, its hands getting burnt, so it passed the flame to the third companion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Thus, the three Golden Core-level Fire Fusion Demon Apes took turns, finally delivering the Earth Fiend Fire to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">This time, Ning Jiufan used thirteen talismans in succession to barely seal the Earth Fiend Fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Under the eager gazes of the two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family, Ning Jiufan stored the Earth Fiend Fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Zhu Xuanji couldn't hold back, coughed, and transmitted his voice to Ning Jiufan: "Brother Ning, don't forget our main objective for this trip."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Thus, when the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King was about to continue giving treasures, Ning Jiufan took the initiative to point at the pile of spoils, indicating the mechanical demon general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The Fire Fusion Demon Ape King tilted its head, somewhat puzzled, but after Ning Jiufan insisted, it still pulled out the mechanical demon general and handed it to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The gifts from the Demon Apes were far from over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Ape King gave six more significant gifts, rewarding Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">After that, the Demon Apes began to see them off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Zhu Xuanji achieved his goal and had no motivation to stay in such a dangerous environment, so he immediately led the Golden Core cultivators out of the Demon Ape's lair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">They retraced their steps, reaching the volcano's peak, and once again met Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Although Meng Kui was in the mountain's smoke and clouds, he had observed much of what happened inside Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Seeing the cultivators return, his expression remained indifferent, but he felt a great sense of loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This trip, the Golden Core cultivators had thrilling yet safe experiences, with no casualties, dashing many of Meng Kui's hopes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Jiufan held onto the mechanical demon general, not handing it over to Zhu Xuanji immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
