<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
In the Broad Ape Fruit Cave.<br/>
<br/>
Within the cave of the Nascent Soul-level Demon Ape, the icy mist gradually dissipated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan slowly floated out from the thinning icy mist.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this scene, the Golden Core cultivators present were all excited.<br/>
<br/>
"He‚Äôs out, he‚Äôs out!" Zheng Shuangjun shouted.<br/>
<br/>
The four Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou and Zheng families gathered around, expressing their gratitude and concern.<br/>
<br/>
His face was as pale as gold paper, his lips white, his entire being drained, like a piece of paper fluttering in the wind, extremely weak.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Ning, you‚Äôve really worked hard this time!" Zhu Xuanji was the first to step forward, immediately supporting Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's body was still trembling slightly.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at Zhu Xuanji with vacant eyes, his eye sockets red, a mix of sorrow and joy as if he had survived a great ordeal.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji also observed Ning Jiufan, seeing the sunken eye sockets and cheeks of the latter, he couldn't help but be secretly shocked: "How long has it been!"<br/>
<br/>
Their words were completely heartfelt.<br/>
<br/>
If it weren‚Äôt for Ning Jiufan standing at the forefront, one of them might have become a sacrificial offering.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Ning, your righteousness! Your sacrifice and dedication this time will be remembered by all of us for life!" "You saved us all. This is a life-saving grace, and we will definitely repay it in the future."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan sighed deeply: "I was also saving myself. After this battle, I hope that in the future, we can advance and retreat together, united in building a bright future." All the Golden Core cultivators nodded in agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's great sacrifice elevated his status among the Golden Core cultivators, earning him immense influence!<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun took out a portion of Nine Yang Yellow Ox Balm.<br/>
<br/>
He concernedly said to Ning Jiufan, "Brother Ning, you are extremely weak now, you should use some of our Zheng family's top-grade elixirs." Unexpectedly, Ning Jiufan's eye twitched fiercely upon seeing the Nine Yang Yellow Ox Balm.<br/>
<br/>
He suppressed his nausea, waving his hand repeatedly: "No, no, don‚Äôt let me see that elixir." "Alright, alright!" Zheng Shuangjun quickly put the balm away.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core cultivators immediately understood that Ning Jiufan's injuries were not just physical but also psychological.<br/>
<br/>
His sacrifice was truly immense!<br/>
<br/>
This made everyone admire Ning Jiufan even more, generating a stronger sense of compensation.<br/>
<br/>
Next, everyone took out various miraculous elixirs, giving them to Ning Jiufan, almost feeding him water and medicine by hand.<br/>
<br/>
The various miraculous elixirs had excellent effects, quickly stabilizing Ning Jiufan's aura.<br/>
<br/>
Roar!<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the Nascent Soul-level Fire Fusion Demon Ape suddenly let out a low roar.<br/>
<br/>
The overwhelming Nascent Soul-level aura made all the Golden Core cultivators and the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King outside the cave pause.<br/>
<br/>
By now, the icy mist had completely dissipated.<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul-level Fire Fusion Demon Ape looked satisfied, it lay back down, its eyelids slowly closing.<br/>
<br/>
Before falling asleep, it extended a finger, shooting out a stream of blood energy.<br/>
<br/>
The blood energy, like a meteor chasing the moon, moved extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, it landed on Ning Jiufan's forehead, marking a red mole between his brows.<br/>
<br/>
After completing this step, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape completely closed its eyes, falling into a deep sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, it began to snore.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan hurriedly reached out, touching his forehead, feeling the extremely condensed and stubborn blood energy, difficult to remove, his expression became very unsightly.<br/>
<br/>
It was clear that the Nascent Soul-level female ape had completely taken a liking to him, marking him with its unique sign.<br/>
<br/>
What was he supposed to do in the future?<br/>
<br/>
The other Golden Core cultivators stared at the red mole on Ning Jiufan's forehead, each with a look of shock and astonishment, their hearts filled with intense fear and relief.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji quickly transmitted his voice to comfort Ning Jiufan, promising to do his utmost to help him.<br/>
<br/>
The other Golden Core cultivators also expressed that Ning Jiufan's problem was everyone's problem! They would definitely assist him with all their might in the future.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King, accompanied by several Golden Core-level Demon Apes, walked into the cave.<br/>
<br/>
The atmosphere inside the cave immediately became tense.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji stepped forward, standing in front of Ning Jiufan, facing the numerous Golden Core-level Fire Fusion Demon Apes.<br/>
<br/>
However, the Fire Fusion Demon Apes, who had been roaring with anger and fighting to the death not long ago, showed no signs of battle intent.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the human Golden Core cultivators on high alert, they took a few steps back, raising their hands to indicate they had no intention of fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King pointed at Ning Jiufan, then raised its palm, letting out a series of roars.<br/>
<br/>
The several Golden Core-level Demon Apes behind it also clapped, gesticulating wildly, their faces full of admiration, with some even showing looks of worship.<br/>
<br/>
The human Golden Core cultivators looked at each other, then focused their gazes on Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's face turned even more unsightly!<br/>
<br/>
The admiring gazes of the Fire Fusion Demon Apes, along with the clapping, felt like slaps on his face, making him extremely embarrassed and annoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and the others tried to keep a straight face, some frowning, some biting their tongues, some tensing their muscles.<br/>
<br/>
After clapping for a while, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King pointed at Ning Jiufan again, then pointed at the cave entrance.<br/>
<br/>
It repeated this gesture three times, then led the Golden Core-level Demon Apes out of the cave.<br/>
<br/>
The human Golden Core cultivators understood its meaning‚Äîit was inviting them out.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji took the lead, walking at the forefront.<br/>
<br/>
The Zheng and Zhou family cultivators guarded Ning Jiufan, the great hero, in the middle of the group.<br/>
<br/>
The human Golden Core cultivators walked out of the cave, arriving at the previous battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The Fire Fusion Demon Ape King waved its hand at the gathered Demon Apes, then let out a roar.<br/>
<br/>
The Foundation Establishment-level Demon Apes scattered.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, only the Golden Core-level ones remained.<br/>
<br/>
The Fire Fusion Demon Ape King suddenly pounded its belly, then vomited out a stone ball.<br/>
<br/>
It then grabbed the stone ball, with a reluctant expression, and handed it to Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
The legendary scene of the Demon Ape tribe rewarding a hero had occurred!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's eyes flashed with golden light, immediately recognizing the stone ball, his expression stunned: "This is a Fire Core Pomegranate. Each pomegranate seed is an explosive talisman, capable of unleashing an attack comparable to a full-strength strike of an ordinary Golden Core." "But using it this way would be a waste!"<br/>
<br/>
"The pomegranate seeds can be used as fire cores, combined with other suitable fuels, to preserve special fire seeds.<br/>
<br/>
"I've never seen such a large pomegranate before. Even the royal treasury doesn't have such high-quality Fire Core Pomegranates." Without a doubt, this was an extremely rare heavenly material and earthly treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing Zhu Xuanji's explanation, Ning Jiufan immediately reached out to take the pomegranate. After inspecting it, he took out a talisman, sticking it on the pomegranate's surface, then placed the pomegranate into his storage belt.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying couldn't help but feel fortunate: "I didn't expect the Ape King to have such a trump card. It seems we were lucky to avoid a deadly battle with the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King by accidentally entering the cave."<br/>
<br/>
The two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family stared at the pomegranate, their gazes glued to it.<br/>
<br/>
They communicated privately: "These pomegranate seeds can be used in many ways for refining artifacts." "Indeed, I've already thought of at least thirty uses. Its effects must be excellent!"<br/>
<br/>
After giving the pomegranate, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King called out a few times.<br/>
<br/>
Three Golden Core-level subordinates immediately turned and left.<br/>
<br/>
After a dozen breaths, they returned.<br/>
<br/>
The leading Fire Fusion Demon Ape was holding a massive flame with both arms.<br/>
<br/>
The flame was as large as a carriage, primarily deep red, but occasionally flickered with black. At the tip of the flame, black smoke often emanated.<br/>
<br/>
"Earth Fiend Fire!"<br/>
<br/>
"Such a large flame, it's a Nascent Soul-level resource!" The cultivators exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
Earth Fiend Fire not only had terrifying firepower and emitted high temperatures at all times, but it also possessed the intense toxicity of fire fiend.<br/>
<br/>
It had limited use in alchemy, mainly for refining fire poison pills.<br/>
<br/>
But it could be used for artifact refining.<br/>
<br/>
This flame alone surpassed the capabilities of the Zheng family's top-tier artifact refining room in some aspects.<br/>
<br/>
The two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family were mesmerized.<br/>
<br/>
This flame was extremely tempting to them!<br/>
<br/>
The Fire Fusion Demon Apes had no cultivation techniques, relying on their natural physical growth and constant tempering in nature to reach Golden Core-level combat power.<br/>
<br/>
They had no spells to isolate the high temperature of the Earth Fiend Fire, only their special body structure to withstand it.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core-level Demon Ape carrying the Earth Fiend Fire gradually couldn't bear it, its hands getting scorched, forcing it to pass the flame to its companion.<br/>
<br/>
The companion carried it for a while, but also couldn't endure, its hands getting burnt, so it passed the flame to the third companion.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the three Golden Core-level Fire Fusion Demon Apes took turns, finally delivering the Earth Fiend Fire to Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
This time, Ning Jiufan used thirteen talismans in succession to barely seal the Earth Fiend Fire.<br/>
<br/>
Under the eager gazes of the two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family, Ning Jiufan stored the Earth Fiend Fire.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji couldn't hold back, coughed, and transmitted his voice to Ning Jiufan: "Brother Ning, don't forget our main objective for this trip."<br/>
<br/>
Thus, when the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King was about to continue giving treasures, Ning Jiufan took the initiative to point at the pile of spoils, indicating the mechanical demon general.<br/>
<br/>
The Fire Fusion Demon Ape King tilted its head, somewhat puzzled, but after Ning Jiufan insisted, it still pulled out the mechanical demon general and handed it to Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
The gifts from the Demon Apes were far from over.<br/>
<br/>
The Ape King gave six more significant gifts, rewarding Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
After that, the Demon Apes began to see them off.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji achieved his goal and had no motivation to stay in such a dangerous environment, so he immediately led the Golden Core cultivators out of the Demon Ape's lair.<br/>
<br/>
They retraced their steps, reaching the volcano's peak, and once again met Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
Although Meng Kui was in the mountain's smoke and clouds, he had observed much of what happened inside Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the cultivators return, his expression remained indifferent, but he felt a great sense of loss.<br/>
<br/>
This trip, the Golden Core cultivators had thrilling yet safe experiences, with no casualties, dashing many of Meng Kui's hopes.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan held onto the mechanical demon general, not handing it over to Zhu Xuanji immediately.</div>
