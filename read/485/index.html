<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Jiufan had actually already returned to the vicinity of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">However, at Lin Bufan‚Äôs suggestion, he did not go back to his family but remained hidden where he was, to delay Meng Kui‚Äôs arrangements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Now, Meng Kui had sent out a flying message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Jiufan very soon received this letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">‚ÄúMeng Kui can‚Äôt sit still anymore and has finally urged me to join him in targeting the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence,‚Äù Ning Jiufan exhaled a heavy breath and slowly stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He gazed at the distant Fire Persimmon Mountain, looking solemn as he realized that this hunt for the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence would be a huge challenge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The real difficulty of this challenge was not actually the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence, nor was it ‚Äúhunting down the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence while also watching out for the citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.‚Äù The real problem was Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Although the Lava Immortal Palace had officially changed hands, and the Meng Family and Zhu Family were in the next phase of their struggle over Fire Persimmon Immortal City‚Äî</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Relying on Zhu Xuanji‚Äôs efforts, the Zhu Family successfully drew in both the Zhou Family and the Ning Family as nails to pin down the Meng Family‚Äôs invasions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Under normal circumstances, Meng Kui could not easily make a move against these two families, but now that the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence was in play, using this to make an issue of it had become almost inevitable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Thick smoke rolled continuously at the entrance of Fire Persimmon Mountain, and searing lava occasionally splashed out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Inside Fire Persimmon Mountain lay the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Meng Kui was seated cross-legged on the palace‚Äôs throne, his gaze sharp, piercing through the void and through layers of mountain and lava, watching the battlefield in the middle of the volcano.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The battlefield was already set up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The two Golden Core ancestors of the Zhou Family were in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Meng Kui sent a message with his divine sense, his tone icy: ‚ÄúNing Jiufan has been slow to arrive, his negligence plain to see. After this battle, I will settle accounts with him.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">‚ÄúBut time waits for no one. Begin the fight.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Both Golden Core cultivators of the Zhou Family wore grave expressions and responded simultaneously, accepting the order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Although they had allied themselves with the Zhu Family, Fire Persimmon Immortal City‚Äôs safety was at stake. As Golden Core cultivators and citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, they had no choice but to stand forward and contribute their strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Since the Zhou Family held so many resources and enjoyed so many rights in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, it naturally had to bear such responsibilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">This was the rule of the righteous path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">‚ÄúRise,‚Äù Meng Kui said with a soft shout, officially activating the grand formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This grand formation was pieced together bit by bit over a long period by him and the Zhou Family‚Äôs two Golden Core ancestors. They had been so cautious in order to avoid alerting the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence early, preventing it from escaping deeper underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The benefit of their caution showed itself in the very next moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence was drifting up and down in the lava, carefree and relaxed, when it was suddenly trapped by the grand formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">It realized it had fallen into a trap at once. Flames flared fiercely all around it, and its eyes revealed a burning fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">When the grand formation was activated, it unleashed its power, creating chains of lightning that swiftly and accurately snared the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence‚Äôs body froze for a moment, electricity flashing ceaselessly over it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Furious, it let out a shrieking howl and struggled with all its might, but the grand formation immediately increased its power. The electric light swelled, becoming blindingly bright and continuing to restrain the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Afterward, the two Golden Core ancestors of the Zhou Family manipulated part of the array‚Äôs power, triggering changes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Countless talismans, like swarms of fireflies, grew from small to large and settled onto the surface of the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence‚Äôs body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">As more and more talismans attached, the Fire Essence‚Äôs roar, the flames burning all around it, and even its size swiftly shrank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">A divine ability ‚ÄîHeaven and Earth Within One‚Äôs Sleeve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Seeing his moment, Meng Kui slowly stretched out his arm, his wide sleeve quickly expanding into a massive black hole, unleashing a violent suction force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The pitch-black sleeve pulled the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Just as the sleeve was shrinking, a sudden burst of fire shot out. Then four or five streaks of flame burned holes in the sleeve and shot back out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">These flames coalesced in midair once again into the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence‚Äôs hazy humanoid shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">With a furious roar, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence ignited a sea of flames inside the array. At the same time, billowing lava surged up, threatening to swallow everything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The array took a violent hit, and many of its formation nodes collapsed one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Seeing the danger, the two Golden Core ancestors of the Zhou Family hastily controlled the array, unleashing numerous hand seals to temporarily stabilize it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Fire Essence‚Äôs surging lava and flames grew ever fiercer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The two Zhou ancestors gradually lost ground, their breathing becoming more and more erratic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Suddenly, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">‚ÄúWhere did it go?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">‚ÄúCareful, it slipped through a gap in the array to get right in front of you!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The two Zhou Family Golden Core cultivators exchanged urgent warnings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Moving with lightning speed, the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence shot forward like a streak of fire and tangled up Zhou Nongying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Right before that moment, Zhou Nongying had been warned, so at the critical juncture he raised his defenses, barely escaping serious injury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Very soon, however, his expression changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">That was because he discovered that the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence was not fully blocked. Countless thin strands of fire were rapidly penetrating his defenses, trying to burrow into his body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">‚ÄúZhou Nongying, hold on!‚Äù The other Zhou Family Golden Core elder shouted with all his might, his voice trembling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He wanted to help but was afraid of harming Zhou Nongying in the process, leaving him momentarily stuck in an awkward dilemma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">‚ÄúHow about letting me try?‚Äù came Ning Jiufan‚Äôs voice at the critical moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The two Golden Core cultivators of the Zhou Family were overjoyed. They both knew Ning Jiufan had a certain magic treasure that was perfect for resolving the current trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Meng Kui‚Äôs expression remained cold, but he did not immediately tighten the array. Instead, his gaze locked onto Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Jiufan promptly gave an explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Although he wanted Lin Bufan to continue lying in wait, it was too risky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Without Ning Jiufan‚Äôs introduction ‚Äîthat is, his endorsement ‚ÄîMeng Kui could block Lin Bufan outside the array or even attack him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After all, by normal conventions, if a Nascent Soul cultivator wanted to step into the territory of another Nascent Soul cultivator, they had to send a flying message in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Lin Bufan‚Äôs sudden appearance was quite offensive to Meng Kui, even a provocation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">After Ning Jiufan‚Äôs introduction, Meng Kui said to Lin Bufan, ‚ÄúLin Daoist, you are quite warmhearted, which is truly rare. But you must know that in many cases, good intentions can lead to bad outcomes.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Lin Bufan smiled slightly and countered, ‚ÄúJust now I observed Meng Daoist using his magic power, and you still let the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence get away. Although I am just passing through, I am a righteous person with compassion in my heart, unwilling to see the citizens of Lava Immortal City suffer.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Meng Kui: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">As the head of his sect, Lin Bufan managed the Thousand Medicines Sect splendidly. When it came to verbal sparring, he naturally was no less skilled than anyone else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">In the end, Meng Kui gave a faint smile and expressed his thanks for Lin Bufan‚Äôs assistance on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He opened the array, allowing Ning Jiufan and Lin Bufan to enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Seeing the arrival of these two powerful helpers made the two Golden Core cultivators of the Zhou Family overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">‚ÄúNing Daoist, you‚Äôve finally arrived!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Jiufan responded, ‚ÄúI was delayed somewhat in seeking strong reinforcements, so please forgive me, my two fellow Daoists.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">‚ÄúNo need for apologies!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">‚ÄúLess talking, help me out of this crisis first,‚Äù Zhou Nongying couldn‚Äôt hold out anymore. He watched as the fiery lines continued to penetrate him and grew anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">‚ÄúLet me handle it.‚Äù Ning Jiufan laughed loudly, took out the Ice-Heart Jade Flask, opened the mouth of the flask, and aimed it at Zhou Nongying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The next moment, a chill gust poured out from the flask, covering Zhou Nongying entirely, then turning into a block of profound ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Zhou Nongying was frozen within, and his injuries rapidly recovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">At the same time, the bone-chilling cold of the ice block continuously harmed the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The Fire Essence could not stand it and had to re-form into one solid shape, taking on its vague humanoid form again, melting through the ice block and fleeing outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Thus, Zhou Nongying was rescued from danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence now shifted its hatred to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">It moved with incredible speed, turning into a fiery streak in midair and shooting straight at Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Jiufan hurriedly retreated, shouting, ‚ÄúElder Ape, save me.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">In the next instant, an aged Fire-Rong Demon Ape suddenly appeared. She stretched out her hand. Though it looked slow, it was actually quick, and she caught the fiery streak barehanded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence immediately changed its shape, clinging to Elder Ape and trying to burn her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">But this time, the Fire Essence‚Äôs tried-and-true tactic did not work as well as it had with Zhou Nongying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">On one hand, Elder Ape was a Nascent Soul cultivator. On the other hand, she herself was a Fire-Rong Demon Ape, a type of demon beast that lived in volcanoes for years and was famous for soaking in lava baths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Seeing that Elder Ape and the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence were locked in a struggle, Lin Bufan acted at once, casting a spell that conjured vines, each one entwining Elder Ape as well as the Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll help you!‚Äù The two Golden Core cultivators of the Zhou Family were delighted. They quickly drove the grand formation, actively coordinating with Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Witnessing all this, Meng Kui slowly closed his eyes and began using a mysterious technique...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">His move instantly alerted Shen Lingshu, who was waiting outside Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Shen Lingshu suddenly looked up toward the volcano‚Äôs summit. ‚ÄúMeng Kui is making a move.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Zhu Xuanji also became wary. ‚ÄúIndeed. Meng Kui doesn‚Äôt want to confront Ning Jiufan openly, so he‚Äôs very likely to use such methods to secretly sabotage Ning Jiufan‚Äôs fate.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">‚ÄúWhen Ning Jiufan is in fierce combat, a weakening of his fate will be obvious.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">‚ÄúBut the question is, what specific spell will he use?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">A spell‚ÄîCongealing Frost to Lock Life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">In the depths of Meng Kui‚Äôs eyes, the image of Ning Jiufan appeared. Under the effect of the spell, Ning Jiufan‚Äôs fate was no longer lively, as though it were covered in frost, about to be frozen to death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Jiufan‚Äôs luck plummeted, soon reflected on the battlefield as he fell into a huge crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Meanwhile, in the vicinity of Green Forest Immortal City in Two Note Kingdom‚Äî</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">A demon-cultivator elder took a deep breath, and the blood-red spirit pearl on his forehead glowed with focus as he observed Ning Zhuo‚Äôs fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs fate was dropping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs falling, hahaha!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">‚ÄúSo it seems Ning Zhuo previously used some forbidden method to temporarily boost his own fate.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">‚ÄúThe time for the final showdown has arrived. Triple-Line Fate-Breaking Minor Curse!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The demon-cultivator elder shouted, rousing all his power to strike at Ning Zhuo‚Äôs fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">In the shadows, the demon-cultivator elder seemed to hear a thunderous sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Triple-Line Fate-Breaking Minor Curse successfully hit the fate in the left arm. In a split second, it really did scatter most of it, but immediately afterward a layer of frost consolidated the fate again and froze it in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Demon-cultivator elder: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">In Southern Bean Kingdom, at Lava Immortal City‚Äî</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Meng Kui: ‚ÄúHm?!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">His expression changed in that moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">In the depths of his eyes, Ning Jiufan‚Äôs fate‚Äîabout to be frozen and killed‚Äîsuddenly shook violently, shattering the heavy frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">‚ÄúWhat kind of trick is this?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Meng Kui couldn‚Äôt make sense of it for the moment, but he understood this kind of ‚Äúprotection‚Äù was extremely rare, at least at a Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">‚ÄúThat means Ning Jiufan possesses some Nascent Soul-grade treasure that protects his fate?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Unwilling to accept failure, Meng Kui cast Congealing Frost to Lock Life once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Refusing to give up, the demon-cultivator elder continued to use the Triple-Line Fate-Breaking Minor Curse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The two of them: ‚ÄúHm?!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">There was some effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Jiufan‚Äôs fate was indeed further frozen and damaged. Meanwhile, on the other side, Ning Zhuo‚Äôs fate was also significantly scattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Again, Meng Kui refused to accept failure and cast Congealing Frost to Lock Life yet again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The demon-cultivator elder refused to accept failure, continuing to use the Triple-Line Fate-Breaking Minor Curse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The two of them: Aye-hah?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">They made still more progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Jiufan‚Äôs fate continued to dwindle, and Ning Zhuo‚Äôs fate was scattered even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Meng Kui was panting heavily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The demon-cultivator elder started bleeding from his seven apertures (eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth).</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Congealing Frost to Lock Life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Triple-Line Fate-Breaking Minor Curse!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Meng Kui gasped for breath like an ox, face pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The demon-cultivator elder bled from every pore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Congealing Frost to Lock Life!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Triple-Line Fate-Breaking Minor Curse!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Meng Kui‚Äôs gaze became dazed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The demon-cultivator elder‚Äôs ears and nose gushed blood, the flow unending.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Congealing Frost to Lock Life!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Triple-Line Fate-Breaking Minor Curse!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Meng Kui‚Äôs head swam, his vision darkening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The demon-cultivator elder had become a blood-soaked figure, face ashen, shaking on the verge of collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">‚ÄúThis Ning Jiufan (Ning Zhuo) is stronger than expected, definitely not easy!‚Äù Both Nascent Soul cultivators, miles apart, shared the same thought in that moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Watching from the sidelines, Shen Lingshu wore a look of surprise. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think Ning Jiufan‚Äôs fate foundation would be so strong. Just now, Meng Kui used his fate-based technique over and over. It‚Äôs quite impressive that Ning Jiufan still held on.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Zhu Xuanji, unable to see such details, heard Shen Lingshu‚Äôs exclamation and echoed, ‚ÄúThe Ning Family still has some depth. Truly worthy of being a powerful clan in the northern lands.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">All the while, Meng Kui could barely keep his eyes from rolling back into his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">He immediately gave up that spell, secretly feeling both anxious and confused: ‚ÄúStrange. Why was I so fixated on just using Congealing Frost to Lock Life?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">‚ÄúMaybe I should switch spells. That might bring a better outcome!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Back near Green Forest Immortal City‚Äî</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The demon-cultivator elder half-knelt on the ground, a huge pool of blood beneath him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">He clenched his teeth and stubbornly persisted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">‚ÄúNo!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">‚ÄúI can‚Äôt pass out. If I pass out, under the curse‚Äôs power, my grandson‚Äôs fate will be snatched away by that thief Ning Zhuo!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">‚ÄúWill the great cause of rebuilding the demon country fail because of me?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">‚ÄúAbsolutely impossible‚Ä¶‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">‚ÄúI must hold on‚ÄîI still have one last strike in me.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">‚ÄúTri‚Ä¶Triple-Line Fate-Break‚Ä¶ing‚Ä¶‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">This time, without Meng Kui‚Äôs counteraction, the demon-cultivator elder easily scattered Ning Zhuo‚Äôs fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">‚ÄúSuccess!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Instantly, wild joy filled his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">‚ÄúI did it! So he was already at the end of his rope. My persistence was worth it. Worth‚Ä¶!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">The very next moment, a majestic radiance flared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Amidst the brilliance, the fate Ning Zhuo had just lost regrouped and solidified in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">The Buddha Heart Demon Seal was finally triggered at that moment, subduing his fate!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">The demon-cultivator elder‚Äôs eyes bulged, and he cried out, ‚ÄúNo‚Äî!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">He struggled to endure the pain and despair, about to squeeze out more strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">In Southern Bean Kingdom, at Fire Persimmon Mountain‚Äî</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time!‚Äù Shen Lingshu pulled out a cloth bag and opened it, returning a large amount of fate to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">In that instant, Ning Jiufan‚Äôs fate skyrocketed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">Meng Kui‚Äôs newly attempted spell was like a head ramming into an iron anvil, hurting him so badly that he sucked in a sharp breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">Ning Jiufan and Ning Zhuo were connected by a life-thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs fate also soared accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">At that moment, it spelled doom for the demon-cultivator elder!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">He was crushed to death, turning into a cloud of smoke that soon dissolved into nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">Without his support, Ning Zhuo‚Äôs left-arm fate‚Äîwhich had grown stronger again‚Äîferociously seized the earth-yellow heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">Squeak, squeak, squeak‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">The monkey face on the heart shrieked with panic, terror, and fury in one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="349">There was a light pop as the left arm squeezed the monkey-faced earth-yellow heart to pieces, absorbing everything!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
