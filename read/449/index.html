<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Various types of elixirs were poured into their mouths. At this moment, every second counted, and both Sun Ning and the other person spared no effort to recover.<br/>
<br/>
Very soon, they took action once again.<br/>
<br/>
According to Ning Zhuo’s plan, they did not go to steal the spirit energy pool; instead, they went to the armory.<br/>
<br/>
A stone sphere suddenly emerged from beneath the armory’s floor, immediately triggering the alarm and the defensive array’s attacks.<br/>
<br/>
“Hold them off for me!” Ning Zhuo borrowed the stone sphere and employed earth-based spells!<br/>
<br/>
Surging magical power was rapidly consumed, transforming into a vast earthen-yellow halo.<br/>
<br/>
The halo was thin, but its defense was profound, easily withstanding all attacks.<br/>
<br/>
“The armory is under attack!”<br/>
<br/>
“Hurry, follow me in and kill the enemy!!”<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators guarding outside the warehouse heard the commotion and immediately rushed inside.<br/>
<br/>
Then, they saw a round, plump stone sphere rolling rapidly through the armory. Wherever it passed, sets of armor and spears disappeared one after another.<br/>
<br/>
“Someone is stealing the armaments!”<br/>
<br/>
“Not good, stop him quickly!”<br/>
<br/>
“Thief, leave your life here!”<br/>
<br/>
The White Jade Battalion’s cultivators were furious, attacking one after another.<br/>
<br/>
They employed their military power, causing all sorts of attacks to surge in might, making the earthen-yellow halo shake and quiver… yet that was all.<br/>
<br/>
If this group of soldiers could mobilize their full military strength, perhaps they could threaten the stone sphere, but how could that be possible now?<br/>
<br/>
Most of their military power was constantly being redirected to assist the main general and deputy generals in besieging Lord Long, and occasionally to help the outer cultivators strengthen defenses and resist the long-range spells of other Golden Core cultivators from Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
If these soldiers had someone at the Golden Core level, then with military power and battle formation blessings, they might harm the stone sphere.<br/>
<br/>
But the reality was that the highest cultivation among these soldiers was only at the Foundation Establishment stage.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s timing was truly excellent. The White Jade Battalion was already too busy to protect everything thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
The stone sphere withstood various attacks, made a full round through the armory, and took away almost all the armaments.<br/>
<br/>
Then, under more than a dozen pairs of extremely furious eyes, it swiftly drilled into the ground and vanished once again.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the stone sphere, within the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon:<br/>
<br/>
A large batch of armor and spears was piled up into a small mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong fully released his theft technique, making them extremely miniature. Otherwise, the mechanism inside the Traveling Dragon really wouldn’t have fit them all!<br/>
<br/>
Qiong Yu Armor!<br/>
<br/>
Jing Guang Spears!<br/>
<br/>
The battle armor was primarily milky white, its surface emitting a gentle jade-like glow, both tough and strong, offering outstanding defense.<br/>
<br/>
The armor’s overall shape was round. The shoulder plates were smooth, with flowing lines. The chest plate resembled a round mirror, gracefully curved, the whole design simple and elegant.<br/>
<br/>
The spears were snow-white, with sharp tips gleaming coldly. The spear shafts were icy, about seven feet long. The spear butts had a circular ring-like structure functioning like a barrier to prevent slipping, and it could sometimes help block attacks as well.<br/>
<br/>
Whether it was Qiong Yu Armor or Jing Guang Spears, both were weapons that came with their own military techniques.<br/>
<br/>
The former carried a “Hardening Technique” that could cover the entire body with defense; the latter carried an “Edge-Wielding Technique” that could add the spear’s sharpness to one’s fists and feet.<br/>
<br/>
These two military techniques could also be combined to form the “Hardened Defense and Edge-Wielding Technique!”<br/>
<br/>
This technique merged attack and defense into one, making attack serve as defense and defense serve as attack.<br/>
<br/>
If the enemy punched the armor, it would be as if they were punching a spear tip.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, if they tried to smash the thin, sharp spearhead, it would be no different from hitting solid armor.<br/>
<br/>
The Hardened Defense and Edge-Wielding Technique was quite a classic piece of military strategy. Once activated, offense and defense balanced perfectly, without any weaknesses.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, even though these two kinds of weaponry were only at the magical artifact level, not at the magic treasure level, they were still quite valuable on the market.<br/>
<br/>
The market price of Qiong Yu Armor was about forty thousand low-grade spirit stones, and a Jing Guang Spear about seventy thousand low-grade spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
There were more than four hundred sets of Qiong Yu Armor and more than three hundred eighty Jing Guang Spears.<br/>
<br/>
Their total value was roughly forty-two million two hundred and sixty thousand low-grade spirit stones!<br/>
<br/>
Because they were at the magical artifact level, sealing them was much easier for Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong than dealing with a spirit energy pool.<br/>
<br/>
It was just that the quantity was too large.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Ning both worked so hard that their hands were a blur. After finally finishing all the temporary seals, they collapsed onto the floor, not moving at all.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t want to move anymore.” Ning Zhuo’s face was pale, bloodless, and his eyes were filled with bloodshot veins.<br/>
<br/>
His cultivation was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage, much lower than Sun Lingtong’s.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong struggled to prop himself up and sit upright, encouraging Ning Zhuo:<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, get up quickly. This is an excellent opportunity; we can’t miss it. Think about how we used to fret over cultivation resources.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s expression changed instantly. Past memories and painful emotions struck him like a whip, lashing him cruelly.<br/>
<br/>
“Continue! We’ll keep going!!”<br/>
<br/>
Within the White Jade Battalion:<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long’s palms danced, accompanied by bursts of dragon roars, repeatedly knocking the Golden Core-level deputy generals into backward flight.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing fought with his hands tied.<br/>
<br/>
Because he was not a body cultivator but specialized in the Qi Sea, he could not directly contend with Lord Long.<br/>
<br/>
This was a huge disadvantage in actual combat!<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing could only rely on the White Tiger Rending-Heaven Sword Qi to continuously attack Lord Long, while the Golden Core deputy generals gave their all, acting as human shields to buy time and space for Shuang Jing to maneuver.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core deputy generals were getting weaker, barely able to hold on.<br/>
<br/>
“What’s going on? Our military power has dropped so much!” Shuang Jing sensed something wrong and quickly asked.<br/>
<br/>
His subordinates had long wanted to report this but had no chance before.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Shuang Jing paused his attacks to ask, they immediately cupped their fists and reported:<br/>
<br/>
“Reporting to the Lord General, a stone monster with Nascent Soul-level combat strength has infiltrated our camp. It’s stealing armaments everywhere, and our subordinates, despite their best efforts, cannot capture it.”<br/>
<br/>
“What?!” Shuang Jing’s brow furrowed deeply, “A round stone monster? Could it be... the Old Stone Monster from Thousand Peaks Forest?”<br/>
<br/>
As a main general and a member of a high-ranking clan, he naturally possessed detailed intelligence on the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
A military force’s strength came from many sources. Besides the soldiers themselves, there were also armaments, weather, terrain, and other external factors.<br/>
<br/>
That’s why armaments were stored outside in an armory.<br/>
<br/>
If placed inside storage equipment, they wouldn’t enhance military power. Moreover, if the key storage point was taken, the loss would be even greater.<br/>
<br/>
Never put all your eggs in one basket.<br/>
<br/>
There were too many uncertainties in warfare, so to be safe, it was best to distribute the armaments in batches.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there would be some armaments stored in treasure-level storage items.<br/>
<br/>
However, for storing magical artifacts or treasures, the more you stored, the greater the maintenance cost and corresponding magical power required.<br/>
<br/>
For an individual cultivator, a single excellent storage treasure could hold nearly all their assets with room to spare.<br/>
<br/>
But for an entire army, the volume of materials was huge. Relying solely on storage treasures was hard and cost-ineffective.<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing that the Old Stone Monster had also sneaked in, Shuang Jing’s heart sank to rock bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, going all out against Lord Long had them at their limits, on the brink of collapse.<br/>
<br/>
“If the Old Stone Monster and Lord Long join forces...” Shuang Jing thought of this and drew in a sharp breath.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the next moment, he saw a towering “Sage Light Universal Tower” suddenly vanish.<br/>
<br/>
After successfully stealing it, the stone sphere monster quickly drilled underground again.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing’s eyes widened!<br/>
<br/>
He swept his gaze around and found that of the original seven Sage Light Universal Towers, only four remained.<br/>
<br/>
Without his knowledge, three had already been stolen.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Shuang Jing hailed from a prestigious clan, he felt unbearable heartache at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
Each Sage Light Universal Tower contained supreme-grade spirit stones and was at the magic treasure level, valued around three million six hundred thousand middle-grade spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
Losing three of them at once meant a loss of ten million eight hundred thousand middle-grade spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
“Damn that Old Stone Monster!!!” Shuang Jing wanted nothing more than to drag out that Old Stone Monster and beat it violently.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long also wanted to drag out the Old Stone Monster and beat it!!<br/>
<br/>
“Old Stone Monster, what are you sneaking around for?”<br/>
<br/>
“Hurry up and join forces with me to crush this White Jade Battalion!!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong activated his theft technique. Each time a White Plume Light-Dust Horse appeared inside the Mechanical Dragon, it was first enveloped in a cloud of hallucinogenic smoke.<br/>
<br/>
The White Plume Light-Dust Horses were already restrained and couldn’t move. After inhaling the smoke, they instantly became dizzy and fainted.<br/>
<br/>
“Amazing hallucinogenic smoke, Boss, where did you get this?” Ning Zhuo asked in surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said: “It’s not mine; I got it from Yang Chanyu.”<br/>
<br/>
Only then did Ning Zhuo realize.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu was also from the Void Sect and was much better at using poison arts than Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
After the White Plume Light-Dust Horses were knocked out, Ning Zhuo stacked them up, stuffing one cabin after another full.<br/>
<br/>
Living beings weren't like inanimate objects; their sizes were not easily compressed.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, all body transformation methods havd thresholds, requiring cultivators to practice diligently to gradually master them.<br/>
<br/>
The stone sphere rolled a few more times, stealing all the horses, and then moved downward.<br/>
<br/>
“Our horses!” The Golden Core deputy generals were grief-stricken and furious.<br/>
<br/>
When they had procured this herd, they had paid a great price, begging countless favors to gather them with family support.<br/>
<br/>
But now, all gone!<br/>
<br/>
“Old Stone Monster, I curse you!!”<br/>
<br/>
“Never thought you, a Nascent Soul cultivator, would stoop so low, utterly shameless!!”<br/>
<br/>
“A dignified Nascent Soul cultivator acting like this, so skilled in thievery —you’re a disgrace to all Nascent Soul cultivators.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing, however, had already calmed down: “Let him steal, let him rob!”<br/>
<br/>
“If he teamed up with Lord Long, we might have long since collapsed.”<br/>
<br/>
“Now, losing wealth is indeed heartbreaking, making it hard to breathe, but at least we have stalled the second Nascent Soul-level enemy.”<br/>
<br/>
Following Shuang Jing’s reasoning, the Golden Core deputy generals also felt a sense of relief.<br/>
<br/>
“All generals, we must fight to the end. Defeat Lord Long first, then drive away the old monster!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing transmitted this order via divine sense, boosting morale.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, morale rose slightly.<br/>
<br/>
“Take out the armaments from the storage bags and use them to replenish! Lure the Old Stone Monster to keep stealing, buying us more time!” Shuang Jing resolutely ordered.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to life and death, wealth was insignificant!<br/>
<br/>
Without life, what good was wealth?!<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing knew this decision was wise, but the grief and hatred still festered, accumulating steadily.<br/>
<br/>
White Tiger Rending-Heaven Sword Qi!<br/>
<br/>
Under the blessing of military power, the sharp sword qi once again cut open a wound on Lord Long’s back.<br/>
<br/>
Blood gushed from the wound!<br/>
<br/>
Although Lord Long wore a spiritual treasure, it was only a right shoulder plate. Its defense was not comprehensive, with the strongest defense focused at the right shoulder area.<br/>
<br/>
After a prolonged battle, at the cost of over a hundred casualties, Shuang Jing finally understood Lord Long’s weaknesses.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long stepped back, trying to widen the distance to heal.<br/>
<br/>
But he was inside the military formation, surrounded by enemies on all sides.<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, the Golden Core deputy generals swarmed him. Dozens of punches and kicks landed, causing Lord Long to stumble.<br/>
<br/>
“Old Stone Monster, stop stealing treasures!”<br/>
<br/>
“Once we defeat them, I promise you half of these spoils!”<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long transmitted his thoughts, full of threat: “Have you forgotten that you bear the divine decree?!”<br/>
<br/>
In Lord Long’s view, the Old Stone Monster still hadn’t exerted full strength.<br/>
<br/>
But for Sun Ning and their group, how could they not be giving their all? Time and again they pushed themselves. When exhausted to near death, they recalled the horror of poverty to spur themselves past their limits.<br/>
<br/>
For the stone sphere, it was the same.<br/>
<br/>
The stone sphere itself couldn’t move freely. Merely rolling around like this had already exceeded its limits.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the divine decree no longer bound the three of them; they had long fulfilled its conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Lord Long shouted dozens of times but got no response from the Old Stone Monster. Furious, he shouted outside the formation: “Chi Tengyi, what are you dawdling for? Come help me quickly!”<br/>
<br/>
The Ancient Vine Tribe’s Nascent Soul-level cultivator Chi Tengyi and her Golden Core-level husband Cang Tengwang had already joined the battle.<br/>
<br/>
But they and several other Golden Core cultivators were blocked by the Red Flower Battalion, trapped inside the Red Flower Dharma Aspect.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Dharma Aspect could trap Ma Feitui, so naturally, it could trap them as well.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Tengyi was not a demon cultivator and lacked immense physical strength, so she could not rely on brute force to break free.<br/>
<br/>
However, she and several Golden Core cultivators continuously cast spells, eroding the Dharma Aspect far more effectively than Ma Feitui had.<br/>
<br/>
Military Technique —Rewarding the Three Armies!<br/>
<br/>
Mulan’s face was pale. Holding the general’s order token, she had been maintaining this technique all along.<br/>
<br/>
The technique’s effect was simple and direct: consume spirit stones to increase military strength!<br/>
<br/>
“This can’t go on!”<br/>
<br/>
“Our army’s funds are already tight. With such heavy consumption in this battle, if this continues any longer, we won’t even be able to pay next month’s salaries.”<br/>
<br/>
That’s how war is. Once stuck in a stalemate, it became a horrifying depletion of resources.<br/>
<br/>
A decisive glint flashed in Mulan’s eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Arrow light blazed brightly, like a giant pillar of fiery sunlight shooting straight into the heavens. Its radiance was like a rainbow, overshadowing all else!<br/>
<br/>
She took out a longbow, and in the span of a single breath, she bent the bow and nocked an arrow.<br/>
<br/>
A magic treasure-level weapon, also called a war-treasure — the Raging Phoenix Bow and the Blazing Heart Arrow!<br/>
<br/>
Using extraordinary natural talent to manifest a divine ability — the Red-Hearted Swan Arrow!<br/>
<br/>
With perfect blessings of military power, battle formations, and national strength!<br/>
<br/>
Mulan let go.<br/>
<br/>
The bowstring twanged, like a phoenix’s cry!<br/>
<br/>
One arrow was released, shaking the heavens and splitting the sky.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Lord Long realized, it was too late.<br/>
<br/>
He looked down at his chest. There, his flesh was charred black, a hole gaped, and his heart had been instantly incinerated.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the entire field fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan lowered her head in exhaustion, her hands powerless. The longbow slipped from her grasp, and her body staggered, almost falling over, if not for Zhang Zhongyi’s timely support.<br/>
<br/>
“Niece… no, General Mu… such divine might!” Zhang Zhongyi was overjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
He never anticipated that Mulan, still at the Golden Core stage, could develop her natural talent into a divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
The Red-Hearted Swan Arrow!<br/>
<br/>
Using nearly all of her heart’s blood as the guide, risking everything on a guaranteed hit arrow!!</div>
