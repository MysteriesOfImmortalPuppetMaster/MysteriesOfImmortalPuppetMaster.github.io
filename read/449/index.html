<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 449: The Red-Hearted Swan Arrow</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Various types of elixirs were poured into their mouths. At this moment, every second counted, and both Sun Ning and the other person spared no effort to recover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Very soon, they took action once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">According to Ning Zhuo’s plan, they did not go to steal the spirit energy pool; instead, they went to the armory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">A stone sphere suddenly emerged from beneath the armory’s floor, immediately triggering the alarm and the defensive array’s attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Hold them off for me!” Ning Zhuo borrowed the stone sphere and employed earth-based spells!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Surging magical power was rapidly consumed, transforming into a vast earthen-yellow halo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The halo was thin, but its defense was profound, easily withstanding all attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“The armory is under attack!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Hurry, follow me in and kill the enemy!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The cultivators guarding outside the warehouse heard the commotion and immediately rushed inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Then, they saw a round, plump stone sphere rolling rapidly through the armory. Wherever it passed, sets of armor and spears disappeared one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Someone is stealing the armaments!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Not good, stop him quickly!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Thief, leave your life here!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The White Jade Battalion’s cultivators were furious, attacking one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">They employed their military power, causing all sorts of attacks to surge in might, making the earthen-yellow halo shake and quiver… yet that was all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">If this group of soldiers could mobilize their full military strength, perhaps they could threaten the stone sphere, but how could that be possible now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Most of their military power was constantly being redirected to assist the main general and deputy generals in besieging Lord Long, and occasionally to help the outer cultivators strengthen defenses and resist the long-range spells of other Golden Core cultivators from Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">If these soldiers had someone at the Golden Core level, then with military power and battle formation blessings, they might harm the stone sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">But the reality was that the highest cultivation among these soldiers was only at the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo’s timing was truly excellent. The White Jade Battalion was already too busy to protect everything thoroughly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The stone sphere withstood various attacks, made a full round through the armory, and took away almost all the armaments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Then, under more than a dozen pairs of extremely furious eyes, it swiftly drilled into the ground and vanished once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Inside the stone sphere, within the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">A large batch of armor and spears was piled up into a small mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun Lingtong fully released his theft technique, making them extremely miniature. Otherwise, the mechanism inside the Traveling Dragon really wouldn’t have fit them all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Qiong Yu Armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Jing Guang Spears!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The battle armor was primarily milky white, its surface emitting a gentle jade-like glow, both tough and strong, offering outstanding defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The armor’s overall shape was round. The shoulder plates were smooth, with flowing lines. The chest plate resembled a round mirror, gracefully curved, the whole design simple and elegant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The spears were snow-white, with sharp tips gleaming coldly. The spear shafts were icy, about seven feet long. The spear butts had a circular ring-like structure functioning like a barrier to prevent slipping, and it could sometimes help block attacks as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Whether it was Qiong Yu Armor or Jing Guang Spears, both were weapons that came with their own military techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The former carried a “Hardening Technique” that could cover the entire body with defense; the latter carried an “Edge-Wielding Technique” that could add the spear’s sharpness to one’s fists and feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">These two military techniques could also be combined to form the “Hardened Defense and Edge-Wielding Technique!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This technique merged attack and defense into one, making attack serve as defense and defense serve as attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">If the enemy punched the armor, it would be as if they were punching a spear tip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Similarly, if they tried to smash the thin, sharp spearhead, it would be no different from hitting solid armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Hardened Defense and Edge-Wielding Technique was quite a classic piece of military strategy. Once activated, offense and defense balanced perfectly, without any weaknesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Therefore, even though these two kinds of weaponry were only at the magical artifact level, not at the magic treasure level, they were still quite valuable on the market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The market price of Qiong Yu Armor was about forty thousand low-grade spirit stones, and a Jing Guang Spear about seventy thousand low-grade spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">There were more than four hundred sets of Qiong Yu Armor and more than three hundred eighty Jing Guang Spears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Their total value was roughly forty-two million two hundred and sixty thousand low-grade spirit stones!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Because they were at the magical artifact level, sealing them was much easier for Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong than dealing with a spirit energy pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">It was just that the quantity was too large.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sun Ning both worked so hard that their hands were a blur. After finally finishing all the temporary seals, they collapsed onto the floor, not moving at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“I don’t want to move anymore.” Ning Zhuo’s face was pale, bloodless, and his eyes were filled with bloodshot veins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">His cultivation was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage, much lower than Sun Lingtong’s.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Sun Lingtong struggled to prop himself up and sit upright, encouraging Ning Zhuo:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Little Zhuo, get up quickly. This is an excellent opportunity; we can’t miss it. Think about how we used to fret over cultivation resources.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo’s expression changed instantly. Past memories and painful emotions struck him like a whip, lashing him cruelly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Continue! We’ll keep going!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Within the White Jade Battalion:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Lord Long’s palms danced, accompanied by bursts of dragon roars, repeatedly knocking the Golden Core-level deputy generals into backward flight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Shuang Jing fought with his hands tied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Because he was not a body cultivator but specialized in the Qi Sea, he could not directly contend with Lord Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This was a huge disadvantage in actual combat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Shuang Jing could only rely on the White Tiger Rending-Heaven Sword Qi to continuously attack Lord Long, while the Golden Core deputy generals gave their all, acting as human shields to buy time and space for Shuang Jing to maneuver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Golden Core deputy generals were getting weaker, barely able to hold on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“What’s going on? Our military power has dropped so much!” Shuang Jing sensed something wrong and quickly asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His subordinates had long wanted to report this but had no chance before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Now that Shuang Jing paused his attacks to ask, they immediately cupped their fists and reported:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“Reporting to the Lord General, a stone monster with Nascent Soul-level combat strength has infiltrated our camp. It’s stealing armaments everywhere, and our subordinates, despite their best efforts, cannot capture it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“What?!” Shuang Jing’s brow furrowed deeply, “A round stone monster? Could it be... the Old Stone Monster from Thousand Peaks Forest?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">As a main general and a member of a high-ranking clan, he naturally possessed detailed intelligence on the enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">A military force’s strength came from many sources. Besides the soldiers themselves, there were also armaments, weather, terrain, and other external factors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">That’s why armaments were stored outside in an armory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">If placed inside storage equipment, they wouldn’t enhance military power. Moreover, if the key storage point was taken, the loss would be even greater.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Never put all your eggs in one basket.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">There were too many uncertainties in warfare, so to be safe, it was best to distribute the armaments in batches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Of course, there would be some armaments stored in treasure-level storage items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">However, for storing magical artifacts or treasures, the more you stored, the greater the maintenance cost and corresponding magical power required.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">For an individual cultivator, a single excellent storage treasure could hold nearly all their assets with room to spare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">But for an entire army, the volume of materials was huge. Relying solely on storage treasures was hard and cost-ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Upon hearing that the Old Stone Monster had also sneaked in, Shuang Jing’s heart sank to rock bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Right now, going all out against Lord Long had them at their limits, on the brink of collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“If the Old Stone Monster and Lord Long join forces...” Shuang Jing thought of this and drew in a sharp breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Then, the next moment, he saw a towering “Sage Light Universal Tower” suddenly vanish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">After successfully stealing it, the stone sphere monster quickly drilled underground again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Shuang Jing’s eyes widened!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He swept his gaze around and found that of the original seven Sage Light Universal Towers, only four remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Without his knowledge, three had already been stolen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Even though Shuang Jing hailed from a prestigious clan, he felt unbearable heartache at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Each Sage Light Universal Tower contained supreme-grade spirit stones and was at the magic treasure level, valued around three million six hundred thousand middle-grade spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Losing three of them at once meant a loss of ten million eight hundred thousand middle-grade spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Damn that Old Stone Monster!!!” Shuang Jing wanted nothing more than to drag out that Old Stone Monster and beat it violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Lord Long also wanted to drag out the Old Stone Monster and beat it!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Old Stone Monster, what are you sneaking around for?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Hurry up and join forces with me to crush this White Jade Battalion!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong activated his theft technique. Each time a White Plume Light-Dust Horse appeared inside the Mechanical Dragon, it was first enveloped in a cloud of hallucinogenic smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The White Plume Light-Dust Horses were already restrained and couldn’t move. After inhaling the smoke, they instantly became dizzy and fainted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Amazing hallucinogenic smoke, Boss, where did you get this?” Ning Zhuo asked in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sun Lingtong said: “It’s not mine; I got it from Yang Chanyu.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Only then did Ning Zhuo realize.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Yang Chanyu was also from the Void Sect and was much better at using poison arts than Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">After the White Plume Light-Dust Horses were knocked out, Ning Zhuo stacked them up, stuffing one cabin after another full.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Living beings weren't like inanimate objects; their sizes were not easily compressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thus, all body transformation methods havd thresholds, requiring cultivators to practice diligently to gradually master them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The stone sphere rolled a few more times, stealing all the horses, and then moved downward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“Our horses!” The Golden Core deputy generals were grief-stricken and furious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">When they had procured this herd, they had paid a great price, begging countless favors to gather them with family support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">But now, all gone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Old Stone Monster, I curse you!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Never thought you, a Nascent Soul cultivator, would stoop so low, utterly shameless!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“A dignified Nascent Soul cultivator acting like this, so skilled in thievery —you’re a disgrace to all Nascent Soul cultivators.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Shuang Jing, however, had already calmed down: “Let him steal, let him rob!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“If he teamed up with Lord Long, we might have long since collapsed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“Now, losing wealth is indeed heartbreaking, making it hard to breathe, but at least we have stalled the second Nascent Soul-level enemy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Following Shuang Jing’s reasoning, the Golden Core deputy generals also felt a sense of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“All generals, we must fight to the end. Defeat Lord Long first, then drive away the old monster!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Shuang Jing transmitted this order via divine sense, boosting morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Indeed, morale rose slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">“Take out the armaments from the storage bags and use them to replenish! Lure the Old Stone Monster to keep stealing, buying us more time!” Shuang Jing resolutely ordered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Compared to life and death, wealth was insignificant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Without life, what good was wealth?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Shuang Jing knew this decision was wise, but the grief and hatred still festered, accumulating steadily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">White Tiger Rending-Heaven Sword Qi!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Under the blessing of military power, the sharp sword qi once again cut open a wound on Lord Long’s back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Blood gushed from the wound!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Although Lord Long wore a spiritual treasure, it was only a right shoulder plate. Its defense was not comprehensive, with the strongest defense focused at the right shoulder area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">After a prolonged battle, at the cost of over a hundred casualties, Shuang Jing finally understood Lord Long’s weaknesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Lord Long stepped back, trying to widen the distance to heal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">But he was inside the military formation, surrounded by enemies on all sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">In the next instant, the Golden Core deputy generals swarmed him. Dozens of punches and kicks landed, causing Lord Long to stumble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">“Old Stone Monster, stop stealing treasures!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">“Once we defeat them, I promise you half of these spoils!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Lord Long transmitted his thoughts, full of threat: “Have you forgotten that you bear the divine decree?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">In Lord Long’s view, the Old Stone Monster still hadn’t exerted full strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">But for Sun Ning and their group, how could they not be giving their all? Time and again they pushed themselves. When exhausted to near death, they recalled the horror of poverty to spur themselves past their limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">For the stone sphere, it was the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The stone sphere itself couldn’t move freely. Merely rolling around like this had already exceeded its limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Therefore, the divine decree no longer bound the three of them; they had long fulfilled its conditions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Lord Long shouted dozens of times but got no response from the Old Stone Monster. Furious, he shouted outside the formation: “Chi Tengyi, what are you dawdling for? Come help me quickly!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The Ancient Vine Tribe’s Nascent Soul-level cultivator Chi Tengyi and her Golden Core-level husband Cang Tengwang had already joined the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">But they and several other Golden Core cultivators were blocked by the Red Flower Battalion, trapped inside the Red Flower Dharma Aspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The Red Flower Dharma Aspect could trap Ma Feitui, so naturally, it could trap them as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Chi Tengyi was not a demon cultivator and lacked immense physical strength, so she could not rely on brute force to break free.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">However, she and several Golden Core cultivators continuously cast spells, eroding the Dharma Aspect far more effectively than Ma Feitui had.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Military Technique —Rewarding the Three Armies!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Mu Lan’s face was pale. Holding the general’s order token, she had been maintaining this technique all along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The technique’s effect was simple and direct: consume spirit stones to increase military strength!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“This can’t go on!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">“Our army’s funds are already tight. With such heavy consumption in this battle, if this continues any longer, we won’t even be able to pay next month’s salaries.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">That’s how war is. Once stuck in a stalemate, it became a horrifying depletion of resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">A decisive glint flashed in Mu Lan’s eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Arrow light blazed brightly, like a giant pillar of fiery sunlight shooting straight into the heavens. Its radiance was like a rainbow, overshadowing all else!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">She took out a longbow, and in the span of a single breath, she bent the bow and nocked an arrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">A magic treasure-level weapon, also called a war-treasure — the Raging Phoenix Bow and the Blazing Heart Arrow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Using extraordinary natural talent to manifest a divine ability — the Red-Hearted Swan Arrow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">With perfect blessings of military power, battle formations, and national strength!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Mu Lan let go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">The bowstring twanged, like a phoenix’s cry!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">One arrow was released, shaking the heavens and splitting the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">By the time Lord Long realized, it was too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">He looked down at his chest. There, his flesh was charred black, a hole gaped, and his heart had been instantly incinerated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">For a moment, the entire field fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Mu Lan lowered her head in exhaustion, her hands powerless. The longbow slipped from her grasp, and her body staggered, almost falling over, if not for Zhang Zhongyi’s timely support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">“Niece… no, General Mu… such divine might!” Zhang Zhongyi was overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">He never anticipated that Mu Lan, still at the Golden Core stage, could develop her natural talent into a divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">The Red-Hearted Swan Arrow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Using nearly all of her heart’s blood as the guide, risking everything on a guaranteed hit arrow!!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
