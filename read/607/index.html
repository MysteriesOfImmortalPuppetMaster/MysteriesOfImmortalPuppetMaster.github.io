<paragraph index="1">When Li Xiangshang said he could help her form a temporary army, Qing Chi was visibly startled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“There’s a talent like that in this world? That’s incredible. Is it a high-grade talent?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Li Xiangshang rubbed his smooth, bald head and answered honestly, “It’s only a low-grade one.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Qing Chi immediately grew suspicious. “A low-grade talent, yet it can form an army? I’m not a child. I know just how difficult it is to build a proper force. Every step is a major hurdle - and the further you go, the harder it gets.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“And you’re saying a single low-grade talent can pull it off?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Li Xiangshang had to clarify, “It’s just a temporary army. Temporary.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Then what exactly is this talent?” Qing Chi pressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">But this time, Li Xiangshang didn’t answer directly. “Even if it’s only a temporary force, a matter as serious as founding an army must be discussed with others.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Why don’t we go see your father first?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Over the past few days, Qing Chi had gone to Vigorous Yang Manor several times to find Jiao Ma - who was secretly just Ning Zhuo - but every time, she came back empty-handed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">She had crossed paths with Li Xiangshang on more than one of those visits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">So by now, Li Xiangshang had a fairly clear grasp of her situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Soon, he found Qing Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">When Qing Yan heard that Li Xiangshang wanted to support Qing Chi in building an army, his face filled with shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">But instead of asking about Li Xiangshang’s so-called talent, he questioned his motives. “What has my daughter done to earn Lord Li’s favor?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Li Xiangshang rubbed his bald head again. “I was sent to White Paper Immortal City on the Dragon Sovereign’s orders. His goal is to help the city survive the coming ghost tide. Solving the City Lord’s dilemma is key to that mission.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“I brought with me a Golden Nest Demon Seed - it can enhance the golden swallow bloodline. Combined with the Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation, it’s almost guaranteed to refine the Golden Swallow Trident.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“I reviewed Vigorous Yang Manor’s roster and found only one truly suitable candidate: Sun Tiesheng.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“I offered him the Golden Nest Demon Seed myself, but he refused.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“So I consulted Director Zheng, who advised me to reach out to the Sun Clan, have them pressure Sun Tiesheng.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“I did.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“But the Sun Clan only protected him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Well, they are family, after all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">At this point, Li Xiangshang spread his hands. “Sun Tiesheng is the best possible candidate. I’ve gone over the list again and again - there’s simply no one more suitable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“So I went back to Director Zheng. He said the Sun Clan has seen through my situation and knows I have no alternative. That’s why they’re unafraid. He suggested I pick someone else - just for show - to stir up pressure on them. He doesn’t believe the Sun Clan would go to all the trouble of placing Sun Tiesheng in Vigorous Yang Manor only to stay indifferent when the Golden Swallow Trident is on the line.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Qing Yan listened quietly, frowning deeper as the explanation continued. “And this has what to do with you helping my daughter build an army?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Li Xiangshang chuckled. “I’m getting there.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“I know that Miss Qing has taken a liking to a young man named Jiao Ma. He cultivates the Jiao Clan’s techniques and has strong yang energy. While his current cultivation is still low, he’s bound to surpass Sun Tiesheng someday - or at the very least, stand as his equal.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Thanks to Miss Qing’s repeated visits to Vigorous Yang Manor, I learned that Jiao Ma has a quick mind. He managed to clear his name and win the City Lord’s favor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“So I thought: why not use Jiao Ma to provoke the Sun Clan and Sun Tiesheng?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">At this point, Li Xiangshang turned to Qing Chi again. “But let me make it clear - I already promised Miss Qing. We won’t actually choose Jiao Ma.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“I’m someone who naturally likes to help others find happiness. Seeing Miss Qing Chi go again and again, full of hope, only to come back disappointed each time - it left a sour feeling in my heart too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“So on one hand, helping her form a temporary army gives her a better shot at winning the man she loves. On the other hand, her close ties with Jiao Ma will inevitably boost his standing. When I then leak word that he’s been selected, it’s bound to pressure and provoke the Sun Clan. That might finally push them to agree to my terms.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Qing Yan fell silent after hearing all this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">After a long pause, he looked up at Li Xiangshang, his expression somewhat conflicted. “You’re quite the kind soul, aren’t you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Then he turned to his daughter - and sure enough, saw her watching him with hopeful eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The old father let out a long sigh. “I’ve never had high hopes for the two of them. One’s from the human race, the other from the ghostman race. That kind of future is hard.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Qing Chi immediately retorted, “But there are plenty of couples in our village from both races!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Qing Yan glared. “Those are just ordinary folks. Our family’s situation - and the Jiao Clan’s - is nothing like that!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He grew increasingly agitated. “The old saying is right - once a girl grows up, she can’t be kept at home! Now you’re all grown, and you think you’ve grown wings…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Dad, it’s my life. I’ll be the one to decide!” Qing Chi cut in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“You - ” Qing Yan nearly exploded with frustration, but in the end, she was his own daughter. What could he do?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He knew that if this kept going, it would only turn into another fight. So he forced himself back to the main point. “I understand. If I don’t let you try, you’ll never be willing to let it go.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Fine. This time, I’ll support you with everything I’ve got.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Qing Chi’s eyes lit up. She hadn’t expected her father to agree so decisively - she thought there would be a long argument ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Dad!” she cried, throwing her arms around him in a tight hug.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Qing Yan sighed again, patting her shoulder lightly. His voice was weary. “I’m getting old. I just hope you can find a good match.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“I still don’t believe Jiao Ma is right for you. Even though I’ve agreed to help you, I haven’t changed my view.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“And the reason I’m supporting this - more than anything - is because I think it’ll do you a world of good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Even if it’s just a temporary army, if you can distinguish yourself and catch the eye of the higher-ups in the Immortal City, it will do wonders for your future cultivation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“In the end, people must rely on themselves.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“If you one day reach the Nascent Soul stage, I’ll have nothing more to say.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Qing Chi pouted. “Dad, I don’t have some great immortal talent. How can I possibly reach the Nascent Soul realm at my age? My current cultivation is already pretty impressive, isn’t it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Qing Yan shook his head, clearly at a loss for what to do with his daughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He turned to Li Xiangshang and got down to business, asking what steps were needed to build the army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Li Xiangshang was quite pleased with Qing Yan’s decisiveness. He replied at once, “Even if it’s just a temporary force, the process of forming an army doesn’t change.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“The first step is to rally the army’s spirit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Manual of the Three Armies says: ‘The three armies are the body, the army’s spirit is the soul’ - you must treat the whole army as a spirit artifact, with its heart as the spirit within.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“It’s like breathing life into a dragon painting - only with spirit can the army become truly unified and effective.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Li Xiangshang turned to look at Qing Chi. “Miss Qing has recently made quite a name for herself - her reputation’s on the rise. She’s the perfect vessel to carry the spirit of the army.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“With the application of the tactic Will of the Ranks, we can guide the army’s morale to gather around her, strengthening her as its bearer.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Qing Yan, as a commander at the Golden Core stage, had no shortage of insight. “The steps and tactics are all sound,” he said, “but if forming a real army were that easy, White Paper Immortal City would already have one. Instead, we’re stuck with a city guard that’s all bark and no bite.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“The tactic Will of the Ranks isn’t difficult. It’s easy enough to learn.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“But using it to truly gather a unified spirit - that’s the hard part. Countless sects and forces stumble at this very first hurdle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Li Xiangshang was ready for that. “Which is exactly why it’s time to put my natural talent to use.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“With my innate gift, forming the army’s spirit shouldn’t be too difficult.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Qing Yan perked up - this was finally getting to the heart of it. “May I ask, Lord Li, what is the nature of this talent of yours?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Li Xiangshang scratched the back of his head, a little sheepish. “Well, it doesn’t sound too impressive by name. It’s called ‘Filling Out the Numbers.’”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Qing Yan and Qing Chi exchanged glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Half a day later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Outskirts of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Qing Yan and his party led their forces into another skirmish with the outer reconnaissance riders of the ghost army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Emerald-blue flames encased Qing Chi as she danced across the dim battlefield - graceful and fierce all at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Under the force of her assault, the enemy riders suffered immediate casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The ghostly mounts and soldiers screamed in agony as the flames seared their forms, their bodies evaporating into mist under the blaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Within moments, the entire enemy squad was wiped out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But battle’s end didn’t mean rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Qing Chi moved across the ravaged battlefield, her footsteps trailing green fire. Wherever she passed, the flames leapt onto the wounded cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Their injuries closed up rapidly, and they looked on in astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Many among them were of the ghostman race, with bodies that held both yang energy and deathly yin energy. This was fundamentally different from the human cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">And yet, Qing Chi’s flames - clearly brimming with life force - somehow stimulated their regenerative abilities without disrupting their yin-based cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Who would’ve thought the girl’s green flame was so miraculous!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“She’s really something.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“But why didn’t she use this earlier? We’ve been through so many fights - she could’ve saved us a mountain of healing pills.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Amid their amazement, confusion rose as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Qing Chi spoke up loudly in her defense. “Uncles, elders - it’s not that I was trying to show off. My dad wouldn’t let me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The crowd burst into laughter. Some turned toward Qing Yan, teasing him openly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Many among them were relatives - bound by blood to Qing Yan and Qing Chi. So even those only at the Foundation Establishment stage felt free to rib a Golden Core cultivator like him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Qing Yan endured the good-natured scolding and admitted frankly, “She’s my girl. You know the saying - ‘the tallest beam catches the wind first.’ I didn’t want her drawing too much attention, so I kept her under wraps.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“As for why I’m letting her show her hand now - there’s a reason.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He then told the others about the plan to form a temporary army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">At that, the assembled cultivators slapped their thighs in excitement, all visibly delighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“Well now, forming a real army? That’s great news!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Does that mean we’ll finally be able to go toe-to-toe with the ghost army’s main force?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“Is forming an army really that easy? Sounds a bit far-fetched. Commander Qing Yan, I hope you haven’t been taken in by someone.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Qing Yan waved off the growing doubts around him. “Whether I’ve been tricked or not - well, you can all judge for yourselves soon enough.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“The first step in building an army is forging its spirit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“And that step alone has stopped countless sects in their tracks. It’s incredibly difficult!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“As long as Qing Chi can manifest the will of the ranks, it’ll be plain for all to see - clear at a glance!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The crowd slowly came to their senses. An elder among the Foundation Establishment cultivators spoke up: “If we’re trying to coalesce an army’s will, shouldn’t it be centered on you, Commander Qing Yan?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“You’re the one with Golden Core cultivation, the highest strength among us. If the army spirit is anchored to Qing Chi and she falls in battle, then what? That’s far too risky!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Qing Chi immediately grew anxious. “I can do it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">She turned toward Qing Yan, worry in her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">But Qing Yan waved her off. “That won’t do! I’m getting old. Even at my peak, I’m only at the Golden Core level. What I want most… is for my girl to make a name for herself, to win merit and honor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“That’s my selfish wish. Will you all accept that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The cultivators burst out laughing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“Of course, Commander! That’s some top-tier selfishness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“We get it - might as well just name Qing Chi as your successor now!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Little Qing Chi, with your father putting this much hope in you, don’t let him down. Though I hear you’ve been spending too much time with that human boy of yours - that’s no good!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Qing Chi bristled. “My private affairs aren’t even my father’s business - let alone yours!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Another round of hearty laughter swept through the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Despite her flustered appearance, Qing Chi felt deeply grateful inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The forging of an army’s spirit had to be public. It needed recognition and legitimacy to proceed. Politically, it also carried another meaning: this was a quiet declaration that Qing Chi was the heir apparent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">No one objected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Qing Yan’s authority and the grip he held over his kin were plain to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">But more importantly, it was because of their deep ties - they were truly family, bound by blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">And in a family, things were always easier to talk through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo stepped out from the All-Book Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">White Paper Immortal City was the largest cultivator stronghold in the Ghostly Black Marshlands. Even the great sects like Myriad Manifestations Sect and Soul Devouring Sect had branches here, and naturally, so did the All-Book Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">“Honored guest, take care,” said the building steward, personally seeing Ning Zhuo off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">This time, Ning Zhuo had entered the All-Book Pavilion to purchase a military technique - Burden-Bearing Tactics. It hadn’t come cheap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Military strategies typically fetched a higher price than ordinary techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">On one hand, when deployed properly, military tactics could produce results far beyond what most spells could achieve. On the other, their buyers were usually powerful clans or high-ranking officials. Those without status or position had no use - or desire - for them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo didn’t return to Vigorous Yang Manor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He’d recently learned that Qing Chi often came looking for him there, which had become something of a nuisance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Lately, he’d been cultivating in secret, within the giant paper statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">On one hand, as the holder of the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern, he could stay in contact with Sun Lingtong at all times. On the other, the paper statue was something his mother had left behind. Being inside it gave him a deep, almost instinctive sense of peace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">But this time, something unexpected happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Just as Ning Zhuo was about to step into the giant paper effigy, Qing Chi suddenly darted out in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">She beamed with excitement. “Haha! Little Ma, so this is where you’ve been hiding! I’ve finally caught you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo’s expression instantly darkened. His tone turned cold. “Miss Qing, I already made myself clear in my last message. My circumstances have changed. Whatever was between us is over.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Standing behind Qing Chi was Li Xiangshang, who immediately stepped in. “Human boy, do you have any idea how much effort Miss Qing has gone through just to see you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo snorted. “And you seem to enjoy meddling in other people’s business.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">He was aware of Li Xiangshang’s identity - such information wasn’t hard to obtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">“You may leave now. Stop disturbing my cultivation.” Ning Zhuo flicked his sleeve, clearly dismissing them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">But Qing Chi grinned and raised her chin triumphantly. “Little Ma, look what I’ve got.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">She held up a command token stamped with the official seal of Paperwhite City’s Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo’s brow furrowed. He looked visibly puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Qing Chi said smugly, “With this token, I can come and go as I please. You have no authority over me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ning Zhuo muttered, “How can this be?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Qing Chi stood tall, her chest puffed out with pride, as she stirred the beginnings of the army’s will. “You see it, don’t you? I’m forging the spirit of the ranks right here!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Li Xiangshang added, “We’ve already reported to the City Lord and received her approval. Miss Qing has now been officially appointed Deputy Commander of the City Guard.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ning Zhuo stared hard at Qing Chi, his gaze sharp enough to pierce through the ghostman girl standing before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">At last, he spoke slowly. “The first step in forming an army… is forging its spirit. That’s no easy feat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Qing Chi wiped her nose and grinned. “Please, for me? Piece of cake.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">She clenched her fist and declared with determination, “Little Ma, the City Lord thinks so highly of me now! Just you wait - one day, I’m going to win you back!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Ning Zhuo: “…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">He muttered inwardly, “So that’s what this is about?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Then he recalled the technique he’d just purchased, and a shiver ran down his spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Qing Chi, seeing his silence, assumed he was stunned by her presence. Her smugness only grew. “Little Ma, I came just to tell you this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">“I don’t want to interrupt your cultivation. I’m also relieved you didn’t join that whole Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation - honestly, I’m really happy!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">“I’m leaving now. You keep working hard!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">“Wait,” Ning Zhuo suddenly called out. “Forging the army’s will doesn’t have to happen on a battlefield. This place still holds lingering traces of war - a land steeped in old combat and wrathful spirits.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">“I have a copy of Burden-Bearing Tactics. It can help you collect military fiends and condense the army’s spirit even off the battlefield.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Li Xiangshang gasped. “Burden-Bearing Tactics? That’s a rare technique! Amazing - this will triple the speed at which Miss Qing can forge the spirit!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Qing Chi looked at Ning Zhuo, her gaze brimming with emotion. She nearly burst into tears. “Little Ma, I knew you hadn’t forgotten me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Ning Zhuo felt the chill on his scalp intensify.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
