<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Then, could Ning Zhuo himself go recruit Yuan Dasheng?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The probability of success was practically zero.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The four major forces could pressure others with their influence, but Ning Zhuo couldn’t. He was only at the third level of Qi Refining, and had no voice in the Ning Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Monkey Head Gang already had nearly ten Foundation Establishment cultivators, as well as a powerhouse like Yuan Dasheng. Why would they want to come under Ning Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Then, could he form a partnership instead?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">It was the same logic. A small fry like Ning Zhuo had no qualifications to negotiate any sort of partnership with the Monkey Head Gang or Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Should he reveal the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and show off his real strength?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In Ning Zhuo’s eyes, that would be an unbelievably stupid move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The moment he did so, he’d be betting his life on someone else’s kindness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Monkey Head Gang, kind? Yuan Dasheng, kind?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">A gang that put profit above all else, and a battle-hardened ape who rose up from the bottom – would they be kind?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">All their info was in Ning Zhuo’s hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The life story of Yuan Yi and Yuan Dasheng might be considered inspiring, but that didn’t mean they were kind! In fact, it was much more likely to be the opposite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">For Ning Zhuo, the current situation was extremely dangerous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It was like walking on the edge of a cliff; one wrong step, and he’d plummet into the abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“I have to secretly get rid of Yuan Dasheng!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">This was the only solution Ning Zhuo could think of.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">But how could he do so?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In the Zheng Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Two Golden Core cultivators appeared together to welcome Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Chi Dun was there too.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">At the moment, Zhu Xuanji was examining a medicine bottle in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The bottle was nearly transparent, revealing curling black smoke inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Golden light flickered in Zhu Xuanji’s eyes for a moment. “This is made from fire poison.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Although the black shadow demonic cultivator had escaped Zheng Shuanggou’s hands, the Zheng Clan ancestor had still managed to gather a few things. For example, this strange black smoke, which had sealed off divine sense during the battle and caused Zheng Shuanggou a lot of trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zheng Shuanggou had absorbed some of it and stored the rest, all for the sake of researching it and figuring out a way to counter it during the next confrontation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">When Zhu Xuanji arrived, Zheng Shuanggou naturally didn’t dare hide anything and directly handed it over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Zheng Shuanggou said, “More specifically, this is Furious Heart Fire Poison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Five years ago, a Golden Core cultivator from the Holy Ape Sect came to Fire Persimmon Immortal City. During that time, his cultivation went awry and his soul fused with his spirit pet, a Furious Heart Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“We worked together to kill it inside the Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern. But before dying, the fused Furious Heart Ape caused a massive disturbance within Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Monster beasts, spirit plants, earth energy, lava, fire poison, baleful energy, and plenty of other things were all tainted by its fury and underwent varying degrees of mutation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly and set the bottle down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He had looked at quite a few things since arriving, but to no avail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“It seems I’ll have to personally make a trip into Fire Persimmon Mountain,” Zhu Xuanji said. “Fellow Daoist Zheng Shuanggou, please bring me to the site of the previous battle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zheng Shuanggou looked troubled. “Uh… Divine Investigator Zhu, is that really necessary?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“The Lava Immortal Palace has already emerged, and the former Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern has been destroyed. Although it’s in the process of regenerating, the newly born tunnels and caves aren’t very stable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Especially since the Lava Immortal Palace is still erupting from time to time; the mountain shakes with every eruption and surges of lava destroy most of the new tunnels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“If we’re going, we’ll need to dig our own path. Plus, we’ll be facing endless heat and lava, and the native monster beasts won’t leave us alone, either.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Xuanji said, “No matter how hard it is, I must see things for myself. Fellow Daoist Chi Dun will assist me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Chi Dun furrowed his brows but still nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zheng Shuanggou let out a sigh. As one of the parties involved, he couldn’t dodge responsibility. Thus, he gritted his teeth and said, “Alright, I’ll accompany Divine Investigator Zhu on this journey.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo went to meet Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“This is the latest intel on the Monkey Head Gang and Yuan Dasheng that you asked for.” Sun Lingtong tossed a jade slip to Ning Zhuo, who was disguised as Hanging-Hair Traveler once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo replied in a hoarse voice: “Thank you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“I still need more monkeys. Keep buying up the wild monkeys, and also keep hiring people. The more the Monkey Head Gang’s monkey pets die, the more I’ll pay.” Ning Zhuo threw over a storage pouch filled to the brim with spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Got it.” Sun Lingtong grinned. “Brother, you’re doing great!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Right now, the whole Monkey Head Gang is panicking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Picking fire persimmons is an insanely profitable business. Once you replace the Monkey Head Gang, you’ll be making a killing every year.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Striking first to take the advantage – this is exactly my kind of move. Let me tell you, you really would fit right in at the Spaceless Sect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly without a trace of joy on his face. “As long as Yuan Dasheng is still alive, we can’t underestimate the Monkey Head Gang.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A cold glint flashed in the baby-faced Sun Lingtong’s eyes. He raised a chubby hand and made a chopping motion. “If you ask me, we should just bring in a couple demonic cultivators and make a move together. Find Yuan Dasheng when it’s alone and take it out, you know?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“We can’t rush this!” Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head. “Yuan Dasheng is a veteran warrior and far from simple. All clues point to it hiding a powerful trump card.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong puffed out his chest and spoke boldly. “If we don’t try, how can we know? We can just send in some cannon fodder demonic cultivator – even if they fail, it might force Yuan Dasheng to reveal its trump card.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo’s brows furrowed tightly. Sun Lingtong’s attitude gave him an uneasy feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“If it were so easy to force out its trump card, then why hasn’t anyone succeeded in all these years?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Let me tell you something. This is verified intel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“On the surface, Yuan Dasheng doesn’t have any cultivation, but in reality, it’s cultivated a demonic technique, and its cultivation base definitely isn’t low!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Sun Lingtong was instantly shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Yuan Dasheng was a Molten Flame Demonic Ape, famous for their strength in close combat. If it also had a demonic technique, its battle prowess would multiply by at least tenfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“Also, the Monkey Head Gang has received Fei Si’s permission to participate in the Fire Persimmon Festival. If our actions are too blatant, the City Lord Mansion will probably be the first to come clean us up,” Ning Zhuo continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Sun Lingtong smacked his lips and waved a hand. "Forget it, then."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">But he didn’t expect Ning Zhuo to say, “We won’t go after Yuan Dasheng, but we can make an assassination attempt on Yuan Er. Prior to the assassination, be sure to send him a warning letter. Also, we can’t let the attempt succeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Sun Lingtong’s eyes shifted slyly. "Brother, what are you planning now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">….</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Inside Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Hurry up, I can’t hold on much longer!” Zheng Shuanggou was doing everything he could to maintain a temporary tunnel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Chi Dun was covered in blood as he silently warded off furious monster beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Just a bit longer. Bear with it." Zhu Xuanji’s eyes blazed with golden light as he formed hand seals nonstop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zheng Shuanggou nearly coughed up blood. Zhu Xuanji had already said the same thing half an incense stick’s worth of time ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">As for Chi Dun, he actually did cough up blood, exposing a flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">A fire snake noticed this and immediately rammed forward with its horn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This fire snake was almost a fire flood dragon, with an imposing horn atop its head. If it struck Chi Dun, he would be seriously injured and could even die on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But the next moment, Zhu Xuanji finally finished what he was doing. He then activated a talisman and escaped in a ray of light along with the two other Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Just a few breaths later, the three of them flew out of the volcano.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Safe!" Zheng Shuanggou let out a long breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Chi Dun silently began healing himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zheng Shuanggou looked at Zhu Xuanji. “Divine Investigator Zhu, any gains?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Zhu Xuanji revealed a faint smile. “Yes, huge gains. I used the Root Tracking Origin Tracing Incantation and saw that the immortal palace was bombarded by a thousand jin of fire essence. The one that released the fire essence was a mechanical monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Once I return to Fire Persimmon Immortal City and use the Root Tracking Origin Tracing Incantation again, I will be able to find all related persons and objects. The culprit’s capture is close at hand.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Zheng Shuanggou and Chi Dun both looked over in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Zhu Xuanji gazed up at the sky. “Under my Golden Pupils[^1], the true culprit has nowhere to hide!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Moments later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">After activating the Root Tracking Origin Tracing Incantation and his Golden Pupils innate talent, Zhu Xuanji found himself staring blankly at the city. In his special vision, he saw mechanical monkeys glowing in red light scattered all over...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Divine Investigator Zhu, why aren’t we moving?" Zheng Shuanggou was confused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Zhu Xuanji: …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">[^1]: Golden Pupils – Some translations online call this “Heaven-Piercing Eyes”, but that’s incorrect; the raw is 金睛, literally “gold” + “pupil”, and it’s a direct reference to Sun Wukong’s Fiery Eyes, Golden Pupils (check Chapter 36’s notes for more info).</paragraph><br/><br/>
