<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 446: The Merciless Flowing Water</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Mulan was draped in a red robe, clad in brass armor. Her left hand fell to the hilt of the sword at her waist and suddenly pulled upward.<br/>
<br/>
"Clang!"<br/>
<br/>
With a crisp metallic sound, more than half of the treasured sword at her waist was drawn from its scabbard.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan did not fully unsheathe the weapon, only drawing out most of it. This extent was enough for her to activate her military tactic.<br/>
<br/>
The blade displayed water-like ripple patterns that flowed swiftly. Similar to the Xuanhuang Sword, the military tactic embedded within this Yongquan Sword was activated.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, Mulan shook the command flag, directing the surrounding soldiers to change their battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
Flowing Water Battle Formation!<br/>
<br/>
The marching speed of the Red Flower Battalion suddenly increased.<br/>
<br/>
Under the cooperation of the military tactic within the blade, a battle formation phenomenon was formed once again.<br/>
<br/>
This time, the battle formation phenomenon was like a long river with surging waters. It did not submerge the soldiers but carried them forward like a rushing current.<br/>
<br/>
Although the Grand General's House was in decline, it still had some foundation.<br/>
<br/>
Such a swift and natural battle formation shift demonstrated Mulan's leadership ability far surpassing her peers.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi accompanied her. After a long while, he stopped looking back and turned to Mulan. "General Mu, by doing this..."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi valued loyalty and righteousness greatly. Otherwise, he wouldn't have remembered the kindness of Old General Mu, voluntarily giving up his own medical clinic, ignoring the covetous intentions of many forces toward the General's House, enlisting to help Mulan.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Mulan's act of using "No Shared Glory," diverting disaster eastward, and making the Third General Battalion bear the brunt of a formidable Nascent Soul-level enemy like Ma Feitui, indeed made Zhang Zhongyi feel surprised and uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan had long anticipated Zhang Zhongyi's reaction. Looking ahead with a calm expression, she used her divine sense to transmit her thoughts: "Uncle Zhang, on the battlefield, there can be no personal feelings or mercy."<br/>
<br/>
"The White Jade Battalion is in extreme danger, yet it is extremely important. If this army is annihilated, even if we win, it would be a tragic victory."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if I participate in the upcoming great battle, it would be merely meritorious service to atone for crimes. The idea of reviving the General's House would become a joke!"<br/>
<br/>
"I believe that if my father were here, he would do the same."<br/>
<br/>
The implication was that Old General Mu was also such a "ruthless" person.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi was left speechless and couldn't help but fall silent.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan continued to explain: "The Red Flower Dharmic Aspect is enveloping Ma Feitui. According to my calculations, relying on the military strength of the Third General Battalion, they can hold for the time it takes an incense stick to burn."<br/>
<br/>
"During this time, perhaps after we assist the White Jade Battalion, we can return to relieve the Third General Battalion."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, I have already sent a flying message containing all the intelligence on Ma Feitui to facilitate the Third General Battalion in their confrontation."<br/>
<br/>
Only then did Zhang Zhongyi feel a bit better, but his face was still clouded with worry. "The Third General Battalion might be able to trap Ma Feitui for a while, but don't forget, besides Ma Feitui, there are also many Golden Core cultivators like Chen Lingfeng and Wu Hen."<br/>
<br/>
"If, by any chance, these people break the Red Cloud Phenomenon and release Ma Feitui, what then?"<br/>
<br/>
Mulan said expressionlessly, "Ma Feitui hates us deeply and is likely to abandon the Third General Battalion, catch up with us, and cause us trouble again."<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, it's also possible that Ma Feitui, unable to quell his anger, will massacre the Third General Battalion to vent his rage."<br/>
<br/>
"But Uncle Zhang, this is the battlefield; this is the battlefield!"<br/>
<br/>
"We are not the parents of the Third General Battalion; we do not guarantee their safety."<br/>
<br/>
"What we must strive for is victory; only victory is our pursuit."<br/>
<br/>
"Anyone who steps onto the battlefield must have such awareness!"<br/>
<br/>
Mulan's tone was iron-like, cold and ruthless.<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh!" Zhang Zhongyi sighed again.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't help but look back again, but the Third General Battalion was no longer in sight.<br/>
<br/>
"If Ning Zhuo dies because of this, that would be too bad."<br/>
<br/>
Although he hadn't interacted with Ning Zhuo many times, Zhang Zhongyi already had considerable appreciation for his talent.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, his heart stirred. "As the saying goes, 'Falling flowers have intention, but flowing water is merciless.' Perhaps this is the correct interpretation of the prophetic poem?"<br/>
<br/>
"If back then, Ning Zhuo had agreed to dual cultivation with Mulan, would there be another possibility now?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
Watching as the soldiers' movements became sluggish, fatigue accumulating rapidly, some injured cultivators were already dispirited.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was anxious in his heart. "Second Brother, Third Brother, Military Advisor, what should we do now?"<br/>
<br/>
"This Red Flower Dharmic Aspect has descended upon us, absorbing our military strength to sustain itself."<br/>
<br/>
"It is extremely mysterious and can trap a Nascent Soul-level powerhouse!"<br/>
<br/>
"But our army is not the Red Flower Battalion; it was newly established not long ago, without deep foundations. We can only sustain for a short period before the whole army becomes exhausted and collapses on the spot."<br/>
<br/>
"Should we fully support the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect, try to delay as much as possible, and strive for our allies to come back and aid us?"<br/>
<br/>
"Or should we risk starting a battle, stop supplying the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect, and fight this Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained silent.<br/>
<br/>
But Liu Er directly pointed at him. "Military Advisor, please give your guidance!"<br/>
<br/>
Since joining the army, Ning Zhuo had repeatedly performed, causing Liu Er's evaluation of him to rise each time. Especially this time, Ning Zhuo had shown his prowess, allowing Liu Er to witness his Golden Core-level combat power.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Liu Er completely treated Ning Zhuo as an equal, even with a hint of respect.<br/>
<br/>
He asked Ning Zhuo first, showing his regard for him.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, his relationship with Guan Hong and Zhang Hei was becoming increasingly close, confident that these two sworn brothers would look to him as their leader!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment. "If we risk starting a battle, our casualties will inevitably be heavy."<br/>
<br/>
"The most critical question is, based on the cooperation of the four of us, is our combat power sufficient to deal with a Nascent Soul-level opponent?"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er immediately showed a troubled expression. Although he had some confidence, he had no experience whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Such a great battle was, for him, the first time in his life.<br/>
<br/>
Battling on the battlefield was different from solo fights. One very obvious difference was that there were too many influencing factors.<br/>
<br/>
Our side has the support of national power and military strength, while the opponent is a Nascent Soul-level demon cultivator with mysterious methods yet to be fully explored, and Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and others are watching from the side, eager to move.<br/>
<br/>
These are all major factors that can influence the direction and outcome of the battle.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er found it difficult to predict.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Mulan's flying message arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Her method of transmission was very secretive. A red flower grew from the ground, then rapidly enlarged and bloomed, revealing the jade slip in the heart of the flower.<br/>
<br/>
The intelligence was quickly passed among the four of them for perusal.<br/>
<br/>
In the letter, Mulan detailed various intelligence about Ma Feitui; there was a lot of content, very detailed.<br/>
<br/>
Ma Feitui was quite familiar with the Red Flower Battalion; conversely, Mulan was also quite familiar with Ma Feitui. The number of times they had dealt with each other was indeed too many.<br/>
<br/>
After reading it, Liu Er's anger towards Mulan eased considerably. "General Mu wants to rescue the White Jade Battalion; this is the key to this ambush battle."<br/>
<br/>
"According to this intelligence, we have a certain degree of confidence in dealing with him!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was the second to browse the intelligence. He expressed understanding of Mulan's actions but did not forgive her.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong and Zhang Hei shared the same thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong snorted coldly. "As the daughter of the Grand General, Mulan doesn't take us seriously. She just gives orders without consulting us, not caring whether we agree."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei shouted, "We are also Golden Core cultivators, and our Third General Battalion is not under her command, yet she treats us like this. Truly hateful. We must teach her a lesson in the future!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. "We will settle our accounts with the Red Flower Battalion later."<br/>
<br/>
"If we are to abandon the Red Flower Dharmic Aspect and directly start the battle, then we must act without delay!"<br/>
<br/>
"The longer we delay, the more our soldiers' physical strength and mana will be consumed, and it will be difficult to have the combat power to support us."<br/>
<br/>
"Please, General Liu, make a prompt decision!"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er glanced at Ning Zhuo, seeing the encouraging look in his eyes, then looked at Guan Hong stroking his beard with head held high, and the eager Zhang Hei. He smiled slightly. "What's there to hesitate about? Let's battle!"</div>
