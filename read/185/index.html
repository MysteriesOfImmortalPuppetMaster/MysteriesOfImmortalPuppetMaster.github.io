<paragraph index="1">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Second Transfer Hall, Second Dao Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Wahaha!” Meng Chong laughed heartily, standing with his hands on his hips, his face full of joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Behind him stood seven or eight puppets, each showing signs of damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Despite their battered and broken appearances, they were all extremely excited, cheering loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“We did it! We passed again!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“A new record, this is a brand-new record.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“We're still in first place. The closest to us is the Ning family's Ning Zhuo team, but they’ve only just reached the first Dao Gate. Our advantage is too great.” “Truly worthy of being a celestial talent!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The reformation team from the City Lord's Mansion looked at Meng Chong with deep admiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">They knew very well: Meng Chong's significant contribution to this achievement was indeed crucial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Although Meng Chong's temperament was childish and straightforward, often looked down upon by many cultivators, everyone had to admire him, admire his celestial talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">WildSprint Thunderclap—its applicability is truly broad, its power formidable, capable of what others cannot!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Lava Immortal Palace Main Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit lay on the throne, its gaze penetrating layers of walls and floor tiles, watching the scene of celebration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It snorted angrily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The people from the City Lord's Mansion had already entered the second transfer hall, but until now, no one had discovered the peculiarities of the winding stream—if there was only one gate, why set up such a transfer hall?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">However, this peculiarity was not noticed by anyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew the reason very well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Because in the transfer hall, Yuan Dasheng often appeared, leading to everyone's erroneous assumptions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“No Mechanical Ape appeared. That's great!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“I heard that the team formed by the three families was defeated miserably due to the dual interception of the Mechanical Ape and the Slave Soul Puppets because they had too many people.” “I heard they almost won? It was just because Ning Xiaohui wanted to settle personal scores and missed the crucial moment, delaying the battle.” “Damn it.” Meng Chong clenched his fists, his face full of regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">In his understanding, such transfer halls were often guarded by Mechanical Apes or Slave Soul Puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Meng Chong eagerly anticipated another fierce battle with Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">But recently, he had encountered the Mechanical Ape too few times, making Meng Chong long for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Without Yuan Dasheng guarding, the transfer hall seemed empty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Meng Chong stepped forward to push open the second Dao Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The reformation team cultivators hurriedly stopped him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Young Master Meng Chong, don't always rush to the front.” “Let us push the door, let us do it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Yes, if there's a mechanism behind this door that injures you, our exploration will surely end here.” “After passing the first transfer hall, we haven't found any preparation rooms. Young Master Meng Chong, please be cautious!” It must be said, Ning Zhuo's various mechanisms and traps left a very deep impression on everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“You worry too much!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Meng Chong brushed aside the crowd and once again walked to the door: “If there really is a trap, I am the one most capable of breaking it.” “You all stay behind and watch me clear this level!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Hahaha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Meng Chong laughed heartily, full of vigor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But as he pushed the door, he immediately let out a sound of surprise: “Hmm?” “What's wrong?” The other cultivators were very nervous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The next moment, Meng Chong laughed even louder, more high-spirited than before: “I found it, I found the subsequent techniques!” “Just by touching this door, we can obtain crucial information, the fourth to sixth layers of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.” Meng Chong's words brought great joy to everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">They had been stuck at the peak of the third layer for quite some time, feeling very uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Now, they finally obtained the subsequent techniques, allowing their stalled cultivation to get back on track.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“The door won't open; we must cultivate to the peak of the sixth layer to open it.” Meng Chong felt regretful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">But everyone else was jubilant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Watching their performance, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit anxiously scratched the back of the throne with its claws.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">It wanted to tell the celebrating crowd that besides the Dao Gate, there were also the Demonic Gate and the Buddhist Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Unfortunately, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's authority was limited and could not intervene in this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">While it was frustrated and sulking, the culprit behind all this, Ning Zhuo, was summoning the trial disciple's mark.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Here it comes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“I see it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">In Ning Zhuo's vision, he saw a Life Hanging by a Thread descending from the sky, falling above his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Divine Ability—Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The next moment, Ning Zhuo fully activated his divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Life Hanging by a Thread from the Lava Immortal Palace was severely affected, swaying like a willow in a storm, unable to land on Ning Zhuo's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Hmm?!!” Sensing the anomaly, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit immediately cast its gaze over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">When it saw this scene, it couldn't help but blink repeatedly, feeling like it was dreaming!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Is this real?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo played with the Life Hanging by a Thread from the Lava Immortal Palace, smiling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He stopped interfering, allowing the Life Hanging by a Thread to attach to the back of his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The next moment, Ning Zhuo once again influenced the Life Hanging by a Thread, letting it extract his soul, accelerating his entry into the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This strange feeling, again?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but be shocked, instinctively standing up, its dragon eyes widening to an unprecedented degree!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Room One.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo quickly assembled his puppet body, leaping down from the pile of mechanical parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Now, he was very familiar with the puppet body, his movements light and agile, no longer stiff as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Room One was not occupied by Ning Zhuo alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“Ning Zhuo Young Master?” The reformation team from the Zhou family recognized Ning Zhuo's identity as a big-headed puppet approached.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Ning Zhuo.” Leading this small reformation team was one of the Zhou family's geniuses, Zhou Zhu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo had a close relationship with Zhou Zeshen but had little interaction with Zhou Zhu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Moreover, Zhou Zhu was a man of few words, rarely close to anyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Zhou Zhu knew Ning Zhuo's strength very well, and despite being taciturn, he took the initiative to propose cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo declined politely: “After all, I am from the Ning family. Sorry, fellow Daoists from the Zhou family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A puppet beside Zhou Zhu immediately spoke: “Young Master Ning Zhuo, we all know that you were forced by the main branch of the Ning family to admit that Ning Xiaohui's attack on you was just a mistake.” “But everyone who participated in that action knows it was no mistake.” “It was deliberate, intentional. Fortunately, this is a trial checkpoint, and we all have puppet bodies.” “If it were outside the Immortal Palace, she would be your murderer!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The Zhou family members were indignant for Ning Zhuo, unaware that Ning Zhuo was the mastermind behind it all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, did not respond, but cupped his hands in thanks to everyone, then pushed open the door and entered Room Two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He hid among the reformation team, and given his current status and reputation, exploring the Immortal Palace alone would not arouse any suspicion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo skillfully avoided all the mechanisms in Room Two using his spells and quickly stood before the second gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Zhou family cultivators followed Ning Zhuo's footsteps into Room Two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">They witnessed Ning Zhuo's solo breakthrough process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Amazing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“Didn't expect Young Master Ning Zhuo to be so proficient in spells, it's like second nature to him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“No wonder he holds a seminar every few days, sharing his spellcasting insights. Each time, the Ning family's reformation team benefits greatly!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo turned sideways and saw the Life Hanging by a Threads above the Zhou family's puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">These were all previously set by him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Basically, every cultivator in the three-family joint team had been visited by Ning Zhuo, each with a Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">At this moment, Ning Zhuo clearly noticed: the Life Hanging by a Threads of everyone present from the Zhou family were rapidly thickening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Everyone is recognizing me more deeply…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo waved to the Zhou family members and then pushed open the door to enter Room Three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo had already become famous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He was the master of the black market, had pulled down his own young clan leader, and was at odds with the main branch of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Everything that happened to him was highly topical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">In the recent joint battle, although the team ultimately failed, Ning Zhuo performed the best, leaving a deep impression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Even though the post-battle analysis revealed that Ning Zhuo had been fixated on the smoke chariot, showing flaws in his battle command.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">But his merits far outweighed his flaws!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Now, even in the large joint team of the three families, Ning Zhuo was a heavyweight, not to be underestimated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo acted alone, passing several checkpoints in succession, arriving at Room Eight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Here, he reunited with the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Then, with the help of Yuan Dasheng, he advanced rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">To prevent any unexpected occurrences behind him, he also borrowed Cheng Bai, who was lurking in Room Eight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">If any latecomers tried to catch up, Cheng Bai would eliminate them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Every time, Ning Zhuo had Yuan Dasheng open the door first, meticulously handling these details without making mistakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Soon after, he and Yuan Dasheng arrived at the second transfer hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Meng Chong and others had already disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">They were busy advancing their cultivation after obtaining the subsequent techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Their inability to open the gate did not mean Ning Zhuo couldn't.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo pushed open the second Buddhist gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Seeing his effortless demeanor, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gnashed its teeth in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo was already familiar with the first checkpoint behind the second Buddhist gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Here, he first had to select nine materials, then use limited tools within a limited time to arm Yuan Dasheng as much as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">After that, he had to rely on Yuan Dasheng to pass various tests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">During this period, Ning Zhuo could not control Yuan Dasheng and could only rely on its instincts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“However, now I have a divine ability.” “Life Hanging by a Thread, let me see your power!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo boldly activated his divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: !!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">It was extremely shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">At this moment, it finally confirmed that Ning Zhuo had mastered the complete divine ability Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The Immortal Palace erupted again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Blinding firelight and soaring magma intertwined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's roar reached Meng Kui's ears, and the latter frowned slightly, what's going on?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He heard a sense of panic in the roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Life Hanging by a Thread is effective!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo didn't even use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, just using the Life Hanging by a Thread to command Yuan Dasheng to cheat, easily passing each test.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Although Yuan Dasheng had intelligence, it retained its habits from life, preferring close combat over spellcasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">This flaw was nullified with Ning Zhuo's cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">That day, Ning Zhuo passed three checkpoints in a row, reaching the third transfer hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He touched the Buddhist gate, Dao Gate, and Demonic gate in turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The seventh, eighth, and ninth layers of the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, and Demonic Blood Vein Technique all fell into Ning Zhuo's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Before leaving, Ning Zhuo thoughtfully raised the stone tablets of the Buddhist and Demonic gates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Leaving only one Dao Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
