<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo read the Jade Slip three times before the grief in his heart began to subside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Jade Slip contained a wealth of information, all expressing Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin's concern for Ning Zhuo, covering every aspect of his life, including Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo handed the Jade Slip to Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Luo Si waved his hand, his voice hoarse. "This was left by Young Master's mother. How could I possibly..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Though he didn't know the details, he had clearly heard Ning Zhuo's heartfelt cry of "Mother" earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo slowly shook his head, tears still glistening on his face, his expression filled with sorrow. "This is guidance from my mother, and it specifically mentions you. She instructed me to show it to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"She told me to treat you with utmost respect, as we will be lifelong comrades-in-arms."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Moreover, this information will deepen our understanding of each other. There are no hidden secrets or shameful truths here! However, I have concealed most of the Water Burial Harmony and Merit Accumulation Sutra within. I hope you understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Luo Si apologized and finally extended his hands to accept the Jade Slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After reading it once, his expression turned solemn, and he nodded slightly before returning the Jade Slip to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">On the Jade Slip, Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin had left a message specifically for Luo Si, relaying Old Man Greybone's dying arrangements: Old Man Greybone had entrusted the Water Burial Harmony and Merit Accumulation Sutra to their savior, Ning Zhuo, urging him to quickly study and master the Daoist scripture. Afterward, they were to bury Old Man Greybone in the Wangchuan River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Since it was Senior Greybone's wish," Luo Si said, "I will, of course, assist with all my strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He paused, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes. "Beyond this, I also intend to investigate the battlefield and uncover who was responsible for Senior Greybone's death!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo nodded. "Time is limited. Let's summon the Qing-Jiao Army to sweep the battlefield immediately and gather as much intelligence as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"How long do you think we should spend here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Water Burial Valley lay within the Wangchuan Underworld, making them vulnerable to pursuit by the Lord of the Forgetful River's forces. The area was far from safe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Luo Si considered for a moment. "We must withdraw within half an hour!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Agreed," Ning Zhuo replied instantly, trusting Luo Si's judgment in military matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Half an hour later, the Qing-Jiao Army mobilized precisely on schedule.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The battlefield had been thoroughly scoured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The bodies of the ghost-gods had been dismembered, and every valuable fragment had been taken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Beyond this, there was nothing left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Even the shredded remains of the paper soldier army were meticulously collected by the Qing-Jiao Army and burned to ashes, preventing the Lord of the Forgetful River's forces from tracing the paper soldiers back to their source.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The battle at Water Burial Valley had been fought with brutal intensity. Few valuable spoils remained; the core battlefield had been reduced to a lava-strewn wasteland, offering no reliable clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo and Luo Si both harbored unspoken suspicions about this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Qing-Jiao Army departed Water Burial Valley and resumed their march.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">They had traveled only a few miles when they encountered Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Since being whisked away from Forgetful River Immortal City by Zeng Jide, Sun Lingtong had been traveling nonstop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">However, his cultivation level was insufficient, and the Lord of the Forgetful River, upon his return, immediately issued a kill order, unleashing pursuers from all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Forced to hide and evade, Sun Lingtong's progress was severely hampered. As a result, he had only just reached Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Boss!" Ning Zhuo transmitted through Divine Sense, nearly shouting aloud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The surge of joy in his heart washed away the lingering sorrow from Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Sun Lingtong replied through Divine Sense, "Little Zhuo, my adventure in Forgetful River Immortal City was absolutely thrilling! Luo Si?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">His eyes widened as he spotted Luo Si, and after a moment of shock, he quickly pieced together part of the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo introduced Luo Si and Sun Lingtong to each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">When introducing Sun Lingtong, he said, "This is my most capable subordinate. I sent him to infiltrate Forgetful River Immortal City and wreak havoc."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">When introducing Luo Si, Ning Zhuo recounted Luo Si's miraculous redemption on the Black Cloud Battlefield, where he had turned the tide of battle. He particularly praised Luo Si's impassioned declaration of war, which had rallied the troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">When Sun Lingtong heard Ning Zhuo refer to him as a subordinate, he chuckled, completely unfazed by this topsy-turvy situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The two brothers had cultivated a deep understanding back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. In public, their relationship could shift at will, all for the sake of convenience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Luo Si cupped his hands in greeting, his expression puzzled. "Have we met before?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Sun Lingtong grinned, produced the Dust-Cleansing Cup, and cupped his hands in return. "Many thanks for the generous gift, General."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">It turned out that Luo Si had gifted Sun Lingtong the Dust-Cleansing Cup when they first met on the banks of the Wangchuan River, where Luo Si had been fishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Luo Si's eyes lit up upon seeing the cup. "So it was you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Their initial encounter had occurred when Sun Lingtong's soul had entered the Netherworld, inhabiting the body of a paper soldier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Now that their identities were revealed, Luo Si immediately felt a sense of camaraderie toward Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Azure Scorched Army surrounded the trio, and they began their rapid march.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Communicating through Divine Sense, they exchanged accounts of their experiences, each revelation eliciting gasps of astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Sun Lingtong had thought his own adventures were thrilling enough, but Ning Zhuo's tale was like dancing on a tightrope over a cliff, a relentless series of near-death trials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo sighed. "Next time we meet Senior Zeng Jide, we must thank him properly. He's helped us so much!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Luo Si clasped his hands in a sincere gesture of gratitude toward Sun Lingtong. It was Sun Lingtong's audacious rampage through Forgetful River Immortal City, culminating in the theft of the Earth Lung Turbid Qi Surge Barrier - the Formation Artifact at the heart of the Earth Aspect Formation - that had allowed Luo Si to endure as long as he did.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Without Sun Lingtong's actions, Luo Si would have fallen to the Earth Fiend Turbid Filth God long ago. From this perspective, it was no exaggeration to call Sun Lingtong Luo Si's life-saving benefactor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Deeply conscious of his debt, Luo Si immediately vowed to repay this life-saving favor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Sun Lingtong waved his hand dismissively. "My raid on the Immortal City wasn't for you, but for my Lord. There's no need to speak of life-saving favors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Noticing Luo Si addressing Ning Zhuo as "My Lord," Sun Lingtong immediately demonstrated the proper etiquette, as if to say, "See? This is how we should truly treat Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Luo Si shook his head solemnly, his expression grave. "Even if you don't care, I do. I will repay this debt someday!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Sun Lingtong sighed regretfully. "It's a pity Senior Greybone is dead. Alas, what a loss!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">These words instantly stirred Luo Si's grief anew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong reminisced, "Though I only had a brief encounter with Senior Greybone - not even a face-to-face meeting - I could still sense his noble character, his compassion for living beings, and his unwavering commitment to his own path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo quickly added, "If not for Senior Greybone's meticulous planning and guidance, we would never have been able to unravel Lord Wangchuan's century-long scheme! In my opinion, he deserves the greatest credit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Luo Si nodded vigorously, a hint of resentment flickering in his eyes. "Lord Wangchuan sent assassins to kill Senior Greybone. This debt is as vast as the heavens, and I will repay it in this lifetime!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sun Lingtong chuckled, "Don't worry. Our Lord may only be seventeen years old and at the Foundation Establishment stage, but given time, he will undoubtedly surpass Lord Wangchuan. A gentleman's revenge may be delayed, but it will never be denied! When we follow our Lord in the future, we will surely avenge this injustice!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong was exceptionally skilled at coordinating with Ning Zhuo and possessed remarkable eloquence. While stirring Luo Si's desire for revenge, he simultaneously showered Ning Zhuo with praise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Luo Si knew Ning Zhuo was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, but hearing his age - seventeen - still moved him deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He turned to Ning Zhuo, cupped his hands in a respectful bow, and exclaimed in awe, "Young Master, you are truly a prodigy of heaven!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo quickly waved his hand, offering a few modest words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Sun Lingtong, however, raised his head, his face brimming with genuine pride. "Otherwise, why would the Heavenly Mandate of the Mortal Realm choose my Lord to thwart the Lord of the Forgetful River's schemes? Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He was truly overjoyed, especially upon hearing that Ning Zhuo had acquired his third Innate Talent. This news pleased him even more than if he had gained it himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Luo Si glanced at Ning Zhuo, then at Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He could sense the deep bond between the two men. Seeing such genuine loyalty surrounding Ning Zhuo further elevated Luo Si's opinion of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo cleared his throat and turned to Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Sun Lingtong, having known Luo Si for only a short time, failed to grasp the hidden meaning in his words. Luo Si maintained a calm, composed demeanor, befitting a seasoned general, yet his words often carried hidden intentions, like concealed troops lying in wait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo, however, understood perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He pondered aloud, "In my opinion, the enemies who harmed Senior Greybone and my mother may not be subordinates of the Lord of the Forgetful River."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"There are two reasons for this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"First, the battlefield was exceptionally brutal, indicating a high level of combat proficiency. If the Lord of the Forgetful River possessed such powerful subordinates, he would have deployed them to the Black Cloud Battlefield first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Second, if the Lord of the Forgetful River had truly been behind the attack, my mother would have mentioned it in the Jade Slip. But she didn't!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"This isn't out of fear of retaliation from the Lord of the Forgetful River. We've already forged an irreconcilable blood feud with this King of the Underworld."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Mother specifically warned me not to pursue the Chaos Fate Sect matter for now. I suspect they might be the ones who attacked Water Burial Valley..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Sun Lingtong frowned deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Luo Si, however, felt a surge of relief. He was once again struck by how effortless it was to communicate with Ning Zhuo. The latter truly understood Luo Si's unspoken intentions!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo looked earnestly at Luo Si. "I know very little about the Chaos Fate Sect myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He immediately shared all the relevant information he possessed with Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Hearing that even a super sect like the Myriad Phenomena Sect took the Chaos Fate Sect so seriously, Luo Si grew even more concerned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He turned to Ning Zhuo. "A mortal who stares directly at the sun will be blinded. Your mother's warning was wise. We must focus on gathering strength and growing rapidly, so we'll be ready when the time for revenge arrives!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">When it came to revenge, Luo Si was an expert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Luo Si harbored deep-seated hatred and a burning desire to enter the Yang Realm to exact his revenge. Now, having pledged allegiance to Ning Zhuo, the man favored by the Heavenly Mandate of the Mortal Realm, Luo Si felt his future prospects were bright and boundless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Whoosh...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">A sudden, violent Netherwind swept across their path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The bone-chilling wind struck the Qing-Jiao Army without warning, causing several soldiers to fall from their horses. Fortunately, the Black Blood Paper Horses were military-grade, trained to obey commands instantly. They halted in time to prevent a stampede.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Luo Si explained, "The winds of the Netherworld can turn treacherous without warning. Some corrode bone, while others shred souls."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Whoosh... Whoosh... Whoosh...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">As the army advanced, the Netherwind frequently shifted, inflicting casualties on the Qing-Jiao Army. The most vexing aspect was its unpredictability: the wind would blow harmlessly one moment, then suddenly transform into a deadly force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Sun Lingtong frowned. "Strange. I've traveled through the Netherworld before, but I've never encountered such Netherwind Anomalies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Qing-Jiao Army pressed onward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Without warning, the seemingly solid, black gravel-strewn wasteland surface transformed into a viscous, pitch-black vortex of quicksand, as if alive, its gaping maw opening precisely in the path of the army's core formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In the chaos, the Qing-Jiao Army soldiers had no choice but to abandon their Black Blood Paper Horses, stomping them underfoot to resist the immense suction force and forcibly ascend into the air, buying themselves precious time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The other cultivators acted swiftly, rescuing their comrades from the brink of disaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Luo Si said gravely, "This is a Quicksand Black Hole, a natural phenomenon of the Netherworld, similar to the Netherwind Anomaly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"But such occurrences are exceedingly rare."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Over the next leg of their journey, the Qing-Jiao Army encountered three more Quicksand Black Holes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Sun Lingtong: "You call this rare?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">As the Qing-Jiao Army approached a mountain pass, Ning Zhuo decisively ordered, "Bypass this area."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Yet moments after they began their detour, the adjacent cliff face suddenly collapsed, sending countless boulders crashing down upon them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">This time, the Qing-Jiao Army was fully alert and reacted instantly, successfully weathering the catastrophe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Even so, over a dozen soldiers sustained serious injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Luo Si remarked, "If we had passed through the mountain pass, we would likely all be buried alive in the valley by now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">A cold glint flashed in Sun Lingtong's eyes. "Is this the treatment reserved for those who incur Heaven's Displeasure?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He had already learned the full contents of Buddhist Physician Meng Yaoyin's Jade Slip message from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Unlike Luo Si, Ning Zhuo directly shared the Water Burial Harmony and Merit Accumulation Sutra with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo nodded. "It seems this manifestation of Heaven's Displeasure is an endless stream of fatal dangers disguised as 'coincidences.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Even on flat ground, storms can rise!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Sun Lingtong's thoughts wandered. "If this is Heaven's Displeasure, what would happen if it intensified into Heaven's Punishment? Would a Heavenly Tribulation descend?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo and the others had experienced the effects of Heaven's Displeasure firsthand - it was relentless, insidious, and venomous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The Azure Scorched Army advanced cautiously, each step like walking on thin ice. Casualties gradually mounted along their arduous journey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"We've finally arrived."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">They reached the banks of the Nether Dragon River and finally breathed a sigh of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The Nether Dragon River was a unique zone. Cultivators who ventured deep into its waters could traverse between the realms of Yin and Yang. Previously, the Forgotten River Army had used this route to invade the Yin Tide Black Mire Swampland and attack White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Forgetful River Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">City Lord's Manor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">On the bed, the Lord of the Forgetful River slowly regained consciousness, immediately hearing cries of joy and relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Lord, Lord has awakened!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"With Lord awake, everything will be alright."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Lord, urgent report from the front lines! The Ghostfire Underworld has launched a three-pronged assault on our city!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The Lord of the Forgetful River remained dazed, barely registering the weeping and jubilant reports around him. But when he heard the last sentence, his scalp tingled, and he jolted awake, sitting up abruptly. "What? What did you say?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The cultivators surrounding his bed startled. The reporting general repeated his urgent message loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The Lord of the Forgetful River narrowed his eyes, his face hardening with resolve. He rose to his feet. "Issue my orders..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">As he rattled off a series of commands, three defensive lines rapidly materialized in the minds of those present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"What are you standing around for? Get to work!" The Lord of the Forgetful River waved away the crowd, then secretly summoned his trusted confidant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Listen carefully," he ordered coldly. "Spare no effort in accomplishing this task. I authorize you to mobilize all available resources!" His expression remained icy as he continued, "Investigate a Ghost Clan girl named Qing... cough!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Before he could finish, the Lord of the Forgetful River coughed up blood, his vision darkened, and he collapsed unconscious once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Lord Wangchuan!!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo, having infiltrated the Nether Dragon River and officially returned to the Yang Realm, felt a violent tremor in his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"Oh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">He immediately scanned it with his Divine Sense and discovered it was the Lord of the Forgetful River's seal.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
