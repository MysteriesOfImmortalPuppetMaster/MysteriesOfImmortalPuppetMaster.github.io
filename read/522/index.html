<paragraph index="1">Sword Technique —Radiant Lotus!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Shuangjing hovered in mid-air, wielding his treasured sword, and within a few breaths, unleashed a series of sword lights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The sword lights briefly lingered in the air, merging together into the shape of a lotus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The sword-light lotus enveloped a Ginseng Whisker, and in the next moment, it suddenly exploded, scattering the sword light in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Ginseng Whisker was consecutively slashed by dozens of sword lights, and, covered in wounds and no longer able to support itself, broke in half at the midsection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Shuangjing fell to the ground, his knees buckling, and he immediately half-kneeled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Meanwhile, the Golden Core level deputy general by his side immediately took charge, slapping out a large number of sealing talismans, and quickly sealed the two segments of the Ginseng Whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Another subordinate, on the pile of rubble, created a small platform, quickly prepared tea and pastries, then helped Shuangjing up, saying, “General, it is time to rest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Shuangjing stood up, went to the small platform, sat down, and drank tea and ate spiritual food to recuperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Even on the battlefield, he maintained the demeanor of a high-ranking family’s descendant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“General, this is the latest intelligence.” A subordinate presented him with a jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Shuangjing projected his spiritual sense into it, and his brows furrowed slightly: “Why is the top still Liu Er? Ever since he occupied first place yesterday, he has not relinquished it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“In order to push him down from the top, I have spared no effort, mobilizing nearly all the deputy generals to harvest the Ginseng Whiskers together.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“But now it seems, it’s still not working?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“There must be something amiss here!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Shuangjing needed the top position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Not only him, but many military commanders were eager for a higher ranking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The battle merit list was updated every half day, and the entire army could view it, so it became the focal point for competition among the officers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The higher the ranking of the generals within an army, the more recognition they would naturally receive, and the higher the army’s morale would be.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“The soldiers had removed the iron-plated flesh armor from their bodies, and after these days of recuperation, their combat capabilities were nearly fully restored.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Collecting the spoils of war was only the prelude; the main act was that around the front-line camp, various armies would take turns launching attacks, sweeping away enemy bases and forces!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Morale is extremely important. The higher the morale, the greater our army’s combat effectiveness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Having led troops for so many days, and experienced ambush battles, iron-stream charge battles, and so on, he had gained considerable command experience and had a profound sense of the importance of morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“The most crucial thing is, I need to demonstrate my own value through the battle merit list.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“The higher my ranking, the more I could receive endorsements from the various noble families in the royal capital.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Compared to his military abilities, Shuangjing was more perceptive and experienced in politics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He was well aware that if he could maintain the top position on the battle merit list for an extended period, he would surely receive more support. This support included not only spirit stones and magical treasures, but also troops and aides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Thus, Shuangjing personally took action, continuously harvesting the Ginseng Whisker, repeatedly challenging for the top position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">But now it seemed that his efforts had only allowed him to rank second, while the first position remained Liu Er’s.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Someone, go and conduct a thorough investigation. What exactly is going on with Liu Er of the Three-Generals Battalion?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">No sooner had Shuangjing issued the order than an order was delivered to him through a flying message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">It was the Ingenious Princess Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">It turned out that Shuang Ling had also taken note of the situation on the battle merit list, and directly ordered Shuangjing to investigate personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“I’ll go investigate, but who will harvest the Ginseng Whisker? My second position might not be secure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Shuangjing was not very willing, but had no choice, since Shuang Ling was his aunt. Although both of them were Nascent Soul-level cultivators, Shuang Ling was known as the Ingenious Princess and her status was far superior to his.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Shuangjing could only hold his nose, taking along two or three people, and stealthily made his way to the vicinity of Liu Er and Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Where is Ning Zhuo?” Shuangjing was a bit puzzled, as he only discovered Liu Er and Zhang Hei, the two Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Guan Hong was absent, and Shuangjing could surmise the reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Three-Generals Battalion could not be left leaderless, and since the soldiers were already capable of action, to ensure combat capability, low-intensity training had to be conducted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Shuangjing’s confusion was not resolved; in the next moment, his attention was drawn to the fighting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Liu Er and Zhang Hei, facing a Ginseng Whisker, initiated an attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Liu Er wielded the Xuanhuang Sword, enhanced with various defensive spells, and charged forward —taking hits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Ginseng Whisker, having little intelligence, acted on instinct, selecting as its opponent the entity closest to it with the strongest aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Bang, bang, bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Every strike, every blow, produced muffled thunderous sounds, with billowing dust and flying debris.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Liu Er occasionally dodged, but often absorbed the blows directly. At this moment, he had completely attracted the Ginseng Whisker’s attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Meanwhile, taking advantage of the opportunity, Zhang Hei retrieved from his storage belt a set of rolling electric ball cages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The ball cages were nested, of varying sizes, and when they flew into mid-air, they dispersed into seven pieces, rolling down to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The ball cages flickered with electric sparks, their speed increasing as they circled around the Ginseng Whisker, moving about.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">A gleam flashed in Shuangjing’s eyes as he recognized: “This spherical mechanism is drawing up a formation array.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Wherever the ball cages rolled, they often left behind traces of electricity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">These electric traces merged together, and before long, formed a formation array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The ball cages began to burst with intense electric light, using the smallest and most agile ball cage as the center of the array, three other smaller ones as the array’s eyes, and the remaining three larger ones as the array’s legs. Combined with the inscribed array patterns, they formed an electrostatic spike formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Countless electric sparks condensed into fine needle-like forms, piercing the Ginseng Whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The lethality of these electric sparks was very weak; the Ginseng Whisker, ignoring them, continued to batter Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">However, the electric sparks continuously accumulated within the Ginseng Whisker, interfering with its every movement, and producing effects such as paralysis and deformation of movement that grew increasingly apparent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Liu Er’s momentum suddenly dropped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zhang Hei then took out the “Root-Drilling Hammer” and threw it onto the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">This hammer-shaped mechanical construct immediately burrowed into the ground, rapidly approaching the Ginseng Whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zhang Hei then deployed the “Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The latter moved extremely fast, like a brilliant golden thread; before one could notice, it too burrowed underground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake was extremely nimble, utterly lacking the heaviness of the Root-Drilling Hammer, and rapidly closed in on the Ginseng Whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Root-Drilling Hammer stopped halfway, when it was one zhang away from the Ginseng Whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Several wooden rods emerged from the hammer body, extending out a long distance, and were inserted into the surrounding rubble to secure it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">On the hammerhead, a small orifice appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Swish, swish, swish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">In the next moment, from the small hole, one after another, iron nails were shot out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Each iron nail was about the length and thickness of an adult finger, fired at an extremely high speed, and had three types of talismans inscribed on it, rendering it extremely sharp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The iron nails consecutively impaled the Ginseng Whisker, then drilled into its body, and moved to fixed positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">When the number of iron nails reached over fifty, the interference they caused to the Ginseng Whisker became visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Originally, every strike of the Ginseng Whisker was natural and agile, overall as fluid as a snake or as supple as willow. But now, it appeared to be jammed, with every joint frozen, and its movements became jerky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Taking advantage of the situation, the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake coiled around its base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Its scales stood on end, continuously cutting, and forcefully penetrating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Shuangjing employed his spiritual sense and observed in astonishment: “The Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake, as swift as a golden thread, circled around the base of the Ginseng Whisker, and within a very short time, after rotating continuously for over a dozen turns, effortlessly sawed through a thick Ginseng Whisker!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Ginseng Whisker lost its support, and, with its violent movements, immediately collapsed into the stone mill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">At this moment, it plunged into madness, no longer focusing its attacks solely on Liu Er, but attacking every existence that posed a threat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Root-Drilling Hammer was quickly destroyed, and of the rolling electric ball cages, five were broken, leaving only the two smallest that escaped capture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">As for the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake, it had already burrowed deeper underground, escaping this disaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Ginseng Whisker’s frenzy did not last long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The iron nails and electric needles within it continued to exert their power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Soon after, the Ginseng Whisker lay in the rubble, trembling and convulsing continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Liu Er exhaled a mouthful of turbid breath, stepped forward, affixed a sealing talisman, and collected it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Is that all?” Shuangjing glared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He recalled that his own fight with the Ginseng Whisker had been at least ten times more difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">It wasn’t that Shuangjing’s strength was inferior to that of Liu Er and Zhang Hei; on the contrary, as a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, his cultivation and combat power far exceeded that of Liu, Guan, and Zhang—unless the three harnessed the might of the army to leverage greater force, that would be the only way to contend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The difficulty lay in that Shuangjing had to preserve the quality of the Ginseng Whisker as much as possible, rather than focusing solely on attacking it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The better the quality of the Ginseng Whisker, the more battle merits he could secure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">But Shuangjing, being a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, found that many techniques, although powerful, lacked the finesse required, so he could only employ swordsmanship to accomplish this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">These past one or two days scavenging the battlefield had indeed given his sword skills a lot of practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Shuangjing was a noble scion. Clearing the battlefield was essentially a scavenging task, which indeed was a hassle for him; he certainly did not do such things in his daily life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Liu Er was only responsible for attracting firepower; although his cultivation was the strongest, that was not important.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“The ones that played a key role were those three mechanical constructs.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“They worked in tandem, and each possessed a capability that was highly targeted at the Ginseng Whisker. In actual combat, they demonstrated a strong restraining effect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Among the three mechanical constructs, the best quality was that Golden Snake. But that was only at the Golden Core level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“As for that ball cage and the hammer, they were merely at the Foundation Establishment level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Calculating in this way, Shuangjing immediately deduced that Liu Er and Zhang Hei’s resource expenditure was pitifully low. In this battle, they had only lost six or seven Foundation Establishment-level mechanical devices.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Oh, the scales on the Golden Snake need replacing; they are terribly worn out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“Liu Er also expended a lot of magical power, and the treasured sword in his hand was also worn.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“This is too little!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“Zhang Hei didn’t even make an attack; he merely deployed the mechanism.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Shuangjing was a little envious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He compared the current battle with his own performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He had to maintain utmost concentration at all times, controlling the sword light to such a refined degree that it would not overly damage the Ginseng Whisker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">After several battles, while his magical power consumption was not excessive, his spirit could not withstand the strain, so he could only drink tea and eat pastries to replenish his spiritual sense and revitalize his spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">And these spiritual foods cost money, after all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The key issue was that the Ginseng Whisker pieces cut by the sword Qi did not have as superior an appearance as the one Liu Er had harvested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">In matters like this, the weaker the attack that fells the Ginseng Whisker, the better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Liu Er and Zhang Hei’s offensive was exactly so —weak to perfection, it was simply just right!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Indeed, Liu Er didn’t even attack; he merely took the hits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Third brother, you take the next round.” Liu Er, grimacing in pain with his body covered in blue and purple bruises, said as he cast healing spells on himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Zhang Hei let out an “oh,” his mood dejected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Compared to staying in the military camp to train troops, he originally preferred engaging in combat outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">But this mode of combat left him utterly disinterested —it was nothing but taking hits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">However, following the battle procedure designed by Ning Zhuo, they ended up reaping the greatest benefits!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The top spot on the battle merit list was the best reward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Upon overhearing Liu and Zhang’s conversation, Shuangjing felt a ripple in his heart: “So, Liu and Zhang teaming up is merely alternating as live targets.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“Liu, Guan, and Zhang are just a bunch of bumpkins; how could they possibly understand the art of mechanisms?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“It must be the work of that Ning Zhuo!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">“Alright, I underestimated you. Although I had known that you were skilled in using mechanical puppets, I never expected that you would have such ingenious mechanical ideas.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">“Could it be that your main field of study is mechanical arts?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The strange thing was that Ning Zhuo’s performance in the Five Elements magic was indeed dazzling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Even now, after Shuangjing had guessed the truth, he immediately fell into self-doubt: “It’s impossible… If Ning Zhuo were primarily a student of mechanical arts, then how can his mastery of the Five Elements magic be explained?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“With such Five Elements proficiency, why would one even bother to study mechanical arts?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Shuangjing shook his head and quietly left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">He quickly returned to the front-line camp to personally report to Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Shuang Ling, holding the jade slip, perused the images inside it and slowly opened her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Shuangjing, discerning her expression, saw that his aunt had uncommonly shown a trace of a strange look, and he could not help but say, “Aunt, now that I have thoroughly uncovered the secret behind Liu Er’s hold on the top spot, the next step will be simple.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">“With your mastery of mechanical arts, you could absolutely greatly surpass Ning Zhuo’s foundation, aiding me in ascending to the top position.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">However, Shuang Ling shook her head and said calmly, “I cannot do that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Shuangjing was taken aback, looking incredulously at his aunt. He knew very well that his aunt was one of the prominent figures among the Nascent Soul-level cultivators in the two realms, proficient in mechanical arts, and was also extremely proud; it was exceedingly rare for her to admit any shortcomings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Shuangjing, coming to his senses, gasped, “Could it be that Ning Zhuo is an extraordinary genius? That even in his youth, his proficiency in mechanical arts far surpassed yours, Aunt?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">“How could that be?” Shuang Ling snorted coldly, “These three mechanical constructs have simple structures; I could tell as soon as I looked.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">“The true difficulty lies not in the mechanisms themselves, but in the formation arrays and talismans affixed to them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">“These formation arrays and talismans worked in tandem to constitute three categories of magic: metal, fire, and earth.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">“The reason these three mechanisms could be effective against the Ginseng Whisker was essentially because these three schools of magic were exceptionally outstanding and specifically countered the Ginseng Whisker.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">“You haven’t grasped the point, because Ning Zhuo had applied these three schools of magic into his mechanical constructs, thereby forming what is known as mechanical arts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Shuang Ling, being the Ingenious Princess, was many years older than Ning Zhuo. The mastery of mechanical arts accumulated over such a long period of cultivation could not possibly be matched by Ning Zhuo at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">She instantly saw the essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo’s proficiency in mechanical arts, at best, made Shuang Ling think that for a cultivator of his age to have reached that level was already commendable; however, compared to the outstanding disciples of the mechanical arts sects, there was still a significant gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Yet, the formation arrays and talismans that Ning Zhuo had arranged within his mechanisms made Shuang Ling secretly wonder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“It appears that this fellow is extremely proficient in Five Elements magic, having mastered a wide variety of spells. Therefore, at this very moment, he managed to aptly choose those spells that were effective against the Ginseng Whisker.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">“He also possessed a measure of ingenuity, being able to employ mechanical arts to cleverly combine the chosen spells.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“For someone his age to have such a level of Five Elements magic proficiency was truly extraordinary. I suspect he might possess some exceptional innate talent that has allowed him to quickly master Five Elements magic.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Shuangjing furrowed his brows: “But the Ning family specializes in frost talismans.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">By this time, the scouts dispatched by Shuangjing’s side had also gathered much intelligence about Ning Zhuo and the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Shuang Ling shook her head: “That is not the point.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">“I cannot reproduce these three mechanisms, nor do I have the disposition to replicate them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">“I have far more important military duties to attend to.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">“So, do you know what must be done?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Shuangjing was momentarily stunned, then said, “I will go find Ning Zhuo and seek to purchase his mechanical constructs.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">“Difficult.” Shuang Ling shook her head, “That Ning Zhuo is a youth with plenty of spirit. You mentioned before, when he schemed to frame Mu Lan, he refuted you in the tavern. I, too, had given him a hard time at the auction.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">“His likelihood of agreeing with you is very slim.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">A gleam flashed in Shuangjing’s eyes: “Hehe, Aunt, I understand.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">“Ning Zhuo and the trio of Liu, Guan, and Zhang are all outsiders.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">“And we, however, are of the Shuang clan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">“I will go to the quartermaster immediately and inform him that someone has manufactured these three mechanisms. If they become widespread, our army could clear the battlefield even faster, which would be more advantageous to the overall situation. By having the quartermaster apply pressure, Ning Zhuo will be forced to hand them over.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Only then did Shuang Ling nod in satisfaction and wave her hand: “Go on and do it.”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
