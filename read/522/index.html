Sword Technique —Radiant Lotus!<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing hovered in mid-air, wielding his treasured sword, and within a few breaths, unleashed a series of sword lights.<br/>
<br/>
The sword lights briefly lingered in the air, merging together into the shape of a lotus.<br/>
<br/>
The sword-light lotus enveloped a Ginseng Whisker, and in the next moment, it suddenly exploded, scattering the sword light in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
The Ginseng Whisker was consecutively slashed by dozens of sword lights, and, covered in wounds and no longer able to support itself, broke in half at the midsection.<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing fell to the ground, his knees buckling, and he immediately half-kneeled.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the Golden Core level deputy general by his side immediately took charge, slapping out a large number of sealing talismans, and quickly sealed the two segments of the Ginseng Whisker.<br/>
<br/>
Another subordinate, on the pile of rubble, created a small platform, quickly prepared tea and pastries, then helped Shuangjing up, saying, “General, it is time to rest.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing stood up, went to the small platform, sat down, and drank tea and ate spiritual food to recuperate.<br/>
<br/>
Even on the battlefield, he maintained the demeanor of a high-ranking family’s descendant.<br/>
<br/>
“General, this is the latest intelligence.” A subordinate presented him with a jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing projected his spiritual sense into it, and his brows furrowed slightly: “Why is the top still Liu Er? Ever since he occupied first place yesterday, he has not relinquished it.”<br/>
<br/>
“In order to push him down from the top, I have spared no effort, mobilizing nearly all the deputy generals to harvest the Ginseng Whiskers together.”<br/>
<br/>
“But now it seems, it’s still not working?”<br/>
<br/>
“There must be something amiss here!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing needed the top position.<br/>
<br/>
Not only him, but many military commanders were eager for a higher ranking.<br/>
<br/>
The battle merit list was updated every half day, and the entire army could view it, so it became the focal point for competition among the officers.<br/>
<br/>
The higher the ranking of the generals within an army, the more recognition they would naturally receive, and the higher the army’s morale would be.<br/>
<br/>
“The soldiers had removed the iron-plated flesh armor from their bodies, and after these days of recuperation, their combat capabilities were nearly fully restored.”<br/>
<br/>
“Collecting the spoils of war was only the prelude; the main act was that around the front-line camp, various armies would take turns launching attacks, sweeping away enemy bases and forces!”<br/>
<br/>
“Morale is extremely important. The higher the morale, the greater our army’s combat effectiveness.”<br/>
<br/>
Having led troops for so many days, and experienced ambush battles, iron-stream charge battles, and so on, he had gained considerable command experience and had a profound sense of the importance of morale.<br/>
<br/>
“The most crucial thing is, I need to demonstrate my own value through the battle merit list.”<br/>
<br/>
“The higher my ranking, the more I could receive endorsements from the various noble families in the royal capital.”<br/>
<br/>
Compared to his military abilities, Shuangjing was more perceptive and experienced in politics.<br/>
<br/>
He was well aware that if he could maintain the top position on the battle merit list for an extended period, he would surely receive more support. This support included not only spirit stones and magical treasures, but also troops and aides.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, Shuangjing personally took action, continuously harvesting the Ginseng Whisker, repeatedly challenging for the top position.<br/>
<br/>
But now it seemed that his efforts had only allowed him to rank second, while the first position remained Liu Er’s.<br/>
<br/>
“Someone, go and conduct a thorough investigation. What exactly is going on with Liu Er of the Three-Generals Battalion?”<br/>
<br/>
No sooner had Shuangjing issued the order than an order was delivered to him through a flying message.<br/>
<br/>
It was the Ingenious Princess Shuang Ling.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that Shuang Ling had also taken note of the situation on the battle merit list, and directly ordered Shuangjing to investigate personally.<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll go investigate, but who will harvest the Ginseng Whisker? My second position might not be secure.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing was not very willing, but had no choice, since Shuang Ling was his aunt. Although both of them were Nascent Soul-level cultivators, Shuang Ling was known as the Ingenious Princess and her status was far superior to his.<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing could only hold his nose, taking along two or three people, and stealthily made his way to the vicinity of Liu Er and Zhang Hei.<br/>
<br/>
“Where is Ning Zhuo?” Shuangjing was a bit puzzled, as he only discovered Liu Er and Zhang Hei, the two Golden Core cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong was absent, and Shuangjing could surmise the reason.<br/>
<br/>
The Three-Generals Battalion could not be left leaderless, and since the soldiers were already capable of action, to ensure combat capability, low-intensity training had to be conducted.<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing’s confusion was not resolved; in the next moment, his attention was drawn to the fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and Zhang Hei, facing a Ginseng Whisker, initiated an attack.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er wielded the Xuanhuang Sword, enhanced with various defensive spells, and charged forward —taking hits.<br/>
<br/>
The Ginseng Whisker, having little intelligence, acted on instinct, selecting as its opponent the entity closest to it with the strongest aura.<br/>
<br/>
Bang, bang, bang.<br/>
<br/>
Every strike, every blow, produced muffled thunderous sounds, with billowing dust and flying debris.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er occasionally dodged, but often absorbed the blows directly. At this moment, he had completely attracted the Ginseng Whisker’s attention.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, taking advantage of the opportunity, Zhang Hei retrieved from his storage belt a set of rolling electric ball cages.<br/>
<br/>
The ball cages were nested, of varying sizes, and when they flew into mid-air, they dispersed into seven pieces, rolling down to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The ball cages flickered with electric sparks, their speed increasing as they circled around the Ginseng Whisker, moving about.<br/>
<br/>
A gleam flashed in Shuangjing’s eyes as he recognized: “This spherical mechanism is drawing up a formation array.”<br/>
<br/>
Wherever the ball cages rolled, they often left behind traces of electricity.<br/>
<br/>
These electric traces merged together, and before long, formed a formation array.<br/>
<br/>
The ball cages began to burst with intense electric light, using the smallest and most agile ball cage as the center of the array, three other smaller ones as the array’s eyes, and the remaining three larger ones as the array’s legs. Combined with the inscribed array patterns, they formed an electrostatic spike formation.<br/>
<br/>
Countless electric sparks condensed into fine needle-like forms, piercing the Ginseng Whisker.<br/>
<br/>
The lethality of these electric sparks was very weak; the Ginseng Whisker, ignoring them, continued to batter Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
However, the electric sparks continuously accumulated within the Ginseng Whisker, interfering with its every movement, and producing effects such as paralysis and deformation of movement that grew increasingly apparent.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s momentum suddenly dropped.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei then took out the “Root-Drilling Hammer” and threw it onto the ground.<br/>
<br/>
This hammer-shaped mechanical construct immediately burrowed into the ground, rapidly approaching the Ginseng Whisker.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei then deployed the “Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake.”<br/>
<br/>
The latter moved extremely fast, like a brilliant golden thread; before one could notice, it too burrowed underground.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake was extremely nimble, utterly lacking the heaviness of the Root-Drilling Hammer, and rapidly closed in on the Ginseng Whisker.<br/>
<br/>
The Root-Drilling Hammer stopped halfway, when it was one zhang away from the Ginseng Whisker.<br/>
<br/>
Several wooden rods emerged from the hammer body, extending out a long distance, and were inserted into the surrounding rubble to secure it.<br/>
<br/>
On the hammerhead, a small orifice appeared.<br/>
<br/>
Swish, swish, swish!<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, from the small hole, one after another, iron nails were shot out.<br/>
<br/>
Each iron nail was about the length and thickness of an adult finger, fired at an extremely high speed, and had three types of talismans inscribed on it, rendering it extremely sharp.<br/>
<br/>
The iron nails consecutively impaled the Ginseng Whisker, then drilled into its body, and moved to fixed positions.<br/>
<br/>
When the number of iron nails reached over fifty, the interference they caused to the Ginseng Whisker became visible to the naked eye.<br/>
<br/>
Originally, every strike of the Ginseng Whisker was natural and agile, overall as fluid as a snake or as supple as willow. But now, it appeared to be jammed, with every joint frozen, and its movements became jerky.<br/>
<br/>
Taking advantage of the situation, the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake coiled around its base.<br/>
<br/>
Its scales stood on end, continuously cutting, and forcefully penetrating.<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing employed his spiritual sense and observed in astonishment: “The Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake, as swift as a golden thread, circled around the base of the Ginseng Whisker, and within a very short time, after rotating continuously for over a dozen turns, effortlessly sawed through a thick Ginseng Whisker!”<br/>
<br/>
The Ginseng Whisker lost its support, and, with its violent movements, immediately collapsed into the stone mill.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, it plunged into madness, no longer focusing its attacks solely on Liu Er, but attacking every existence that posed a threat.<br/>
<br/>
The Root-Drilling Hammer was quickly destroyed, and of the rolling electric ball cages, five were broken, leaving only the two smallest that escaped capture.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Golden Scale Winding Saw Snake, it had already burrowed deeper underground, escaping this disaster.<br/>
<br/>
The Ginseng Whisker’s frenzy did not last long.<br/>
<br/>
The iron nails and electric needles within it continued to exert their power.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, the Ginseng Whisker lay in the rubble, trembling and convulsing continuously.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er exhaled a mouthful of turbid breath, stepped forward, affixed a sealing talisman, and collected it.<br/>
<br/>
“Is that all?” Shuangjing glared.<br/>
<br/>
He recalled that his own fight with the Ginseng Whisker had been at least ten times more difficult.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn’t that Shuangjing’s strength was inferior to that of Liu Er and Zhang Hei; on the contrary, as a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, his cultivation and combat power far exceeded that of Liu, Guan, and Zhang—unless the three harnessed the might of the army to leverage greater force, that would be the only way to contend.<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty lay in that Shuangjing had to preserve the quality of the Ginseng Whisker as much as possible, rather than focusing solely on attacking it.<br/>
<br/>
The better the quality of the Ginseng Whisker, the more battle merits he could secure.<br/>
<br/>
But Shuangjing, being a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, found that many techniques, although powerful, lacked the finesse required, so he could only employ swordsmanship to accomplish this.<br/>
<br/>
These past one or two days scavenging the battlefield had indeed given his sword skills a lot of practice.<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing was a noble scion. Clearing the battlefield was essentially a scavenging task, which indeed was a hassle for him; he certainly did not do such things in his daily life.<br/>
<br/>
“Liu Er was only responsible for attracting firepower; although his cultivation was the strongest, that was not important.”<br/>
<br/>
“The ones that played a key role were those three mechanical constructs.”<br/>
<br/>
“They worked in tandem, and each possessed a capability that was highly targeted at the Ginseng Whisker. In actual combat, they demonstrated a strong restraining effect.”<br/>
<br/>
“Among the three mechanical constructs, the best quality was that Golden Snake. But that was only at the Golden Core level.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for that ball cage and the hammer, they were merely at the Foundation Establishment level.”<br/>
<br/>
Calculating in this way, Shuangjing immediately deduced that Liu Er and Zhang Hei’s resource expenditure was pitifully low. In this battle, they had only lost six or seven Foundation Establishment-level mechanical devices.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, the scales on the Golden Snake need replacing; they are terribly worn out.”<br/>
<br/>
“Liu Er also expended a lot of magical power, and the treasured sword in his hand was also worn.”<br/>
<br/>
“This is too little!”<br/>
<br/>
“Zhang Hei didn’t even make an attack; he merely deployed the mechanism.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing was a little envious.<br/>
<br/>
He compared the current battle with his own performance.<br/>
<br/>
He had to maintain utmost concentration at all times, controlling the sword light to such a refined degree that it would not overly damage the Ginseng Whisker.<br/>
<br/>
After several battles, while his magical power consumption was not excessive, his spirit could not withstand the strain, so he could only drink tea and eat pastries to replenish his spiritual sense and revitalize his spirit.<br/>
<br/>
And these spiritual foods cost money, after all.<br/>
<br/>
The key issue was that the Ginseng Whisker pieces cut by the sword Qi did not have as superior an appearance as the one Liu Er had harvested.<br/>
<br/>
In matters like this, the weaker the attack that fells the Ginseng Whisker, the better.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er and Zhang Hei’s offensive was exactly so —weak to perfection, it was simply just right!<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, Liu Er didn’t even attack; he merely took the hits.<br/>
<br/>
“Third brother, you take the next round.” Liu Er, grimacing in pain with his body covered in blue and purple bruises, said as he cast healing spells on himself.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei let out an “oh,” his mood dejected.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to staying in the military camp to train troops, he originally preferred engaging in combat outside.<br/>
<br/>
But this mode of combat left him utterly disinterested —it was nothing but taking hits.<br/>
<br/>
However, following the battle procedure designed by Ning Zhuo, they ended up reaping the greatest benefits!<br/>
<br/>
The top spot on the battle merit list was the best reward.<br/>
<br/>
Upon overhearing Liu and Zhang’s conversation, Shuangjing felt a ripple in his heart: “So, Liu and Zhang teaming up is merely alternating as live targets.”<br/>
<br/>
“Liu, Guan, and Zhang are just a bunch of bumpkins; how could they possibly understand the art of mechanisms?”<br/>
<br/>
“It must be the work of that Ning Zhuo!”<br/>
<br/>
“Alright, I underestimated you. Although I had known that you were skilled in using mechanical puppets, I never expected that you would have such ingenious mechanical ideas.”<br/>
<br/>
“Could it be that your main field of study is mechanical arts?”<br/>
<br/>
The strange thing was that Ning Zhuo’s performance in the Five Elements magic was indeed dazzling.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, after Shuangjing had guessed the truth, he immediately fell into self-doubt: “It’s impossible… If Ning Zhuo were primarily a student of mechanical arts, then how can his mastery of the Five Elements magic be explained?”<br/>
<br/>
“With such Five Elements proficiency, why would one even bother to study mechanical arts?”<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing shook his head and quietly left.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly returned to the front-line camp to personally report to Shuang Ling.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling, holding the jade slip, perused the images inside it and slowly opened her eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing, discerning her expression, saw that his aunt had uncommonly shown a trace of a strange look, and he could not help but say, “Aunt, now that I have thoroughly uncovered the secret behind Liu Er’s hold on the top spot, the next step will be simple.”<br/>
<br/>
“With your mastery of mechanical arts, you could absolutely greatly surpass Ning Zhuo’s foundation, aiding me in ascending to the top position.”<br/>
<br/>
However, Shuang Ling shook her head and said calmly, “I cannot do that.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing was taken aback, looking incredulously at his aunt. He knew very well that his aunt was one of the prominent figures among the Nascent Soul-level cultivators in the two realms, proficient in mechanical arts, and was also extremely proud; it was exceedingly rare for her to admit any shortcomings.<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing, coming to his senses, gasped, “Could it be that Ning Zhuo is an extraordinary genius? That even in his youth, his proficiency in mechanical arts far surpassed yours, Aunt?”<br/>
<br/>
“How could that be?” Shuang Ling snorted coldly, “These three mechanical constructs have simple structures; I could tell as soon as I looked.”<br/>
<br/>
“The true difficulty lies not in the mechanisms themselves, but in the formation arrays and talismans affixed to them.”<br/>
<br/>
“These formation arrays and talismans worked in tandem to constitute three categories of magic: metal, fire, and earth.”<br/>
<br/>
“The reason these three mechanisms could be effective against the Ginseng Whisker was essentially because these three schools of magic were exceptionally outstanding and specifically countered the Ginseng Whisker.”<br/>
<br/>
“You haven’t grasped the point, because Ning Zhuo had applied these three schools of magic into his mechanical constructs, thereby forming what is known as mechanical arts.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling, being the Ingenious Princess, was many years older than Ning Zhuo. The mastery of mechanical arts accumulated over such a long period of cultivation could not possibly be matched by Ning Zhuo at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
She instantly saw the essence.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s proficiency in mechanical arts, at best, made Shuang Ling think that for a cultivator of his age to have reached that level was already commendable; however, compared to the outstanding disciples of the mechanical arts sects, there was still a significant gap.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, the formation arrays and talismans that Ning Zhuo had arranged within his mechanisms made Shuang Ling secretly wonder.<br/>
<br/>
“It appears that this fellow is extremely proficient in Five Elements magic, having mastered a wide variety of spells. Therefore, at this very moment, he managed to aptly choose those spells that were effective against the Ginseng Whisker.”<br/>
<br/>
“He also possessed a measure of ingenuity, being able to employ mechanical arts to cleverly combine the chosen spells.”<br/>
<br/>
“For someone his age to have such a level of Five Elements magic proficiency was truly extraordinary. I suspect he might possess some exceptional innate talent that has allowed him to quickly master Five Elements magic.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing furrowed his brows: “But the Ning family specializes in frost talismans.”<br/>
<br/>
By this time, the scouts dispatched by Shuangjing’s side had also gathered much intelligence about Ning Zhuo and the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling shook her head: “That is not the point.”<br/>
<br/>
“I cannot reproduce these three mechanisms, nor do I have the disposition to replicate them.”<br/>
<br/>
“I have far more important military duties to attend to.”<br/>
<br/>
“So, do you know what must be done?”<br/>
<br/>
Shuangjing was momentarily stunned, then said, “I will go find Ning Zhuo and seek to purchase his mechanical constructs.”<br/>
<br/>
“Difficult.” Shuang Ling shook her head, “That Ning Zhuo is a youth with plenty of spirit. You mentioned before, when he schemed to frame Mulan, he refuted you in the tavern. I, too, had given him a hard time at the auction.”<br/>
<br/>
“His likelihood of agreeing with you is very slim.”<br/>
<br/>
A gleam flashed in Shuangjing’s eyes: “Hehe, Aunt, I understand.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo and the trio of Liu, Guan, and Zhang are all outsiders.”<br/>
<br/>
“And we, however, are of the Shuang clan.”<br/>
<br/>
“I will go to the quartermaster immediately and inform him that someone has manufactured these three mechanisms. If they become widespread, our army could clear the battlefield even faster, which would be more advantageous to the overall situation. By having the quartermaster apply pressure, Ning Zhuo will be forced to hand them over.”<br/>
<br/>
Only then did Shuang Ling nod in satisfaction and wave her hand: “Go on and do it.”</div>
