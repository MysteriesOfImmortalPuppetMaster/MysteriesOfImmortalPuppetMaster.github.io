<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo traced his path backward and collected all the rewards that he hadn’t chosen before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">When he arrived back at Room 2, he discovered that his soul power was running low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Each time he opened the door, he needed to use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. This consumed quite a bit of soul power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Soon, Ning Zhuo returned to Room 1 and obtained the One Gust of Air spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“I successfully changed my name, and my soul power is almost all gone. Let’s do another experiment in Room 1.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo picked out a remote area and put his things in the little flying box. Then, he himself crawled in and closed the lid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He activated the trial disciple imprint, and the next moment, his soul returned to his true body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“A smooth return! Very good.” Ning Zhuo clenched his fists. He was genuinely excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">When he was passively entering and exiting the palace, he had to exhaust all his soul power before he could come back. Every time he returned to his body, he would have to go through a period of rest and recovery. The pain of an exhausted soul was one thing, but more importantly, healing from it wasted a lot of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Now that he could actively initiate the return process, he could avoid his condition falling to the lowest point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“My soul power has dropped to less than a third, but there are no problems with ordinary movement.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo first took a few medicinal pills, then disguised himself as Hanging-Hair Traveler again and stepped into the teleportation formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">A moment later, he opened the door of the underground prison cell and saw Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Han Ming heard the sound of the door and abruptly raised her head. When she saw Hanging-Hair Traveler, she cursed madly, as if venting an endless amount anger and hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Seeing the traces of tears on her face, Ning Zhuo sighed and listened quietly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Eventually, Han Ming stopped cursing, pale and panting from the exertion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Taking advantage of this break, Ning Zhuo controlled a dozen mechanical puppets to climb up Han Ming’s body, carrying food and water and preparing to feed her bite by bite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Han Ming closed her lips tightly, seemingly refusing to eat even if it would kill her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Although she didn’t have the energy to curse anymore, her eyes seemed to spit fire as she glared at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo sighed softly. “Don’t be like that. If you don’t eat or drink, you’ll die.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Han Ming immediately revealed a crazed smile. “Die? Hahaha! Dying is better than having my cultivation taken away!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Hanging-Hair Traveler, are you a man or not? If you are, then let me go and fight me for three hundred rounds!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“If I lose, you can slaughter me or enslave me or whatever. Even if you want me to give you my soul essence, I won’t complain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Do you dare?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo shook his head. “Pointless.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">As he spoke, he took out a set of mechanical needles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Han Ming’s pupils swiftly contracted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A moment later, miserable shrieks sounded out in the cell once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This time, Han Ming suffered even more pain than before. Not only did Ning Zhuo extract her soul essence, he also forced her to eat and drink.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Han Ming couldn’t hold on and eventually fainted again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo manipulated the mechanical puppets to pull out the control rods, and carefully apply medicine to each of her wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo’s soul foundation had skyrocketed again. His upper limit was now about six times stronger than before all this had happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Due to the previous loss of soul power, his current reserves were only three times his initial level. However, this was enough for another excursion into the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He returned to his residence and activated the trial disciple imprint, but discovered that he couldn’t enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“So there really is a time limit?” Ning Zhuo had expected this and wasn’t bothered at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He immediately decided to test every cup of tea’s worth of time in order to measure the exact interval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">In the meantime, he didn’t remain idle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He began cultivating his new spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">His most recent exploration had yielded the greatest harvest yet, allowing him to obtain a full three spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">One Gust of Air, Fiery Grasp Art, and Wood Grafting Art. It was time to practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In the City Lord Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The cultivation formation in the room was active, giving rise to spirit energy so rich that it formed into a faint mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Within the mist, Meng Chong was sitting in a cross-legged position, lightning flashing over his whole body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After succeeding in dispersing his power, he had immediately begun cultivating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The spirit energy here was drawn directly from the immortal city’s grand formation, which continuously purified and delivered the boundless fire spirit energy of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">There were also medicinal pills that came from the City Lord Mansion’s treasury, all of which were of exquisite quality and abundant quantity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">And, of course, there was the super-grade innate talent Ferocious Rushing Thunder. Every time it was activated, Meng Chong’s cultivation speed immediately soared!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Suddenly, the lightning on his body disappeared, and Meng Chong opened his eyes in excitement. “Qi Refining, first level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“This kind of cultivation speed is more than ten times faster than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Awesome, really awesome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“As it turns out, Ferocious Rushing Thunder is so useful! Why did I never discover this before?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Sigh, grandpa should have mentioned it to me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Cough cough.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Meng Chong coughed a few times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Looking closely, it could be seen that his face was haggard and there were slightly dark bags under his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Meng Chong was well aware of his current condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Every time he activated Ferocious Rushing Thunder, it consumed the power of his essence, qi, and spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Young Master Meng Chong, it’s time to replenish your body.” A servant’s voice came from outside the cultivation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Alright!” Meng Chong immediately stood up, took a few steps, and pushed open the door in high spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">A while later, he arrived at the replenishment room and jumped directly into a medicinal pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The brownish-yellow elixir in the medicinal pool was made of precious medicinal ingredients, blended carefully and producing a potent, nearly pungent aroma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Soaking himself in the pool, Meng Chong swallowed down various kinds of spirit foods that were brought in by the servants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After filling his stomach, he tilted his head back and chugged two jars of medicinal wine, then gobbled down a few bottles of medicinal pills like snacking on peanuts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">As he ate, blood flowed from his seven orifices.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">A servant reminded nervously, “Young Master Meng Chong, it’s about time. You’ve eaten too much, and your body has reached its limit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Meng Chong laughed. “What’s there to fear? I have my innate talent.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Then, he shouted, “Ferocious Rushing Thunder!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The next moment, countless bolts of electricity erupted from his body again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">With the activation of his innate talent, he digested the medicine extremely quickly. His swollen belly flattened at a speed visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The thick medicinal pool quickly became clear, and soon, the smell of medicine was so faint that it was almost undetectable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Meng Chong jumped out, once more full of energy, and quickly walked away to the cultivation room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“I won’t stop for a single moment and won’t waste a single second. I’m going all out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“The first one to enter the Lava Immortal Palace will be me!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Grandpa, I won't let you down!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Meng Chong fully expressed his innate nature. His movements were full of vigor, and his desire to cultivate was frighteningly strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo’s preliminary testing had a result – six hours!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">This was his fourth entry into the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The puppet body and little flying box that he had deliberately placed in Room 1 were no longer there. This made him feel a little disappointed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">However, when he touched the door, he found that the rewards had refreshed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Using the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, he collected all the rewards from each door. Once he arrived at the maintenance room, Ning Zhuo didn’t hurry to move on. Instead, he looked around at the various mechanical tools and mechanism pedestals, falling into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
