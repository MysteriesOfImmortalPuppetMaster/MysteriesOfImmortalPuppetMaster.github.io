<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 237: Cloud Whale</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">White clouds surged like ocean waves, as a Cloud Whale slowly appeared on the horizon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Its body was immensely large, occupying nearly half of the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Under the blue sky, its gigantic form cast a faint shadow over the mountains below.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">As the Cloud Whale continued to approach, the enormous shadow on the ground gradually extended to the foothills of Fire Persimmon Mountain.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Look! What is that?" The citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City pointed towards the sky, exclaiming in astonishment at their discovery.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Such a colossal demon beast, with the aura of a Nascent Soul level! Run, a Nascent Soul level great demon is attacking the city!" However, before panic could spread, Fei Si's voice echoed throughout the city.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He assured the citizens that there was no need to worry, as what had arrived was not a demon beast, but a vehicle of the Flying Cloud Kingdom's merchant caravanâ€”a Cloud Whale.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Upon learning this, the citizens began to chatter excitedly.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The panic quickly dissipated, replaced by excitement and curiosity.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Everyone was aware of the Cloud Merchants: the Flying Cloud Kingdom's caravans frequently traveled across the five lakes and four seas, their footprints covering the entire cultivation world, and they were very famous.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The reputation of the Flying Cloud Kingdom's merchant caravans was also very high, earning the trust of the public.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"But using a Cloud Whale as a vehicle for the Cloud Merchants, this is the first time I've seen it. Clearly, this is a large-scale caravan." "Is that really a Cloud Whale? It's enormous, truly awe-inspiring."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Many cultivators cast their spells, looking up to the sky to closely observe the Cloud Whale.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Cloud Whale's head was round and wide, its enormous forehead seemingly capable of encompassing the entire firmament.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It had a pair of massive eyes, blue like sparkling gems, large as small lakes, exuding tranquility and wisdom.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The fins on its sides resembled giant white feathers, gently gliding and stirring up breezes, swirling the surrounding clouds into spirals.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Its tail fin was extremely wide and powerful, each gentle swing seemingly capable of propelling the entire sky.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Cloud Whale glided across the sky, its speed varying from slow to fast, as if the natural clouds were summoned by it, naturally gathering around it, forming magnificent cloud streams.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Cloud Whale's immense body leisurely traversed the cloud streams, as if it were the guardian of this realm, serene and composed.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Although the Cloud Whale's life aura was at the Nascent Soul level, it did not exert any oppressive feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Instead, it brought a sense of peace to those who beheld it.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Suddenly, the Cloud Whale emitted a deep and distant call, as if it came from the depths of the sky, penetrating the clouds, carrying a primordial and pure power that reached the deepest part of people's hearts.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">At the moment the whale's call sounded, the entire sea of clouds fell silent, and countless citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City held their breath, listening intently to this celestial sound.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Cloud Whale quietly skimmed across the sky, gradually approaching Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sunlight poured down, filtering through its body, transforming into a gentle radiance, as if the blazing sun had softened because of it.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The citizens of Fire Persimmon Immortal City almost all looked up at the Cloud Whale.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Every movement of the Cloud Whale's fins and tail was so graceful and composed, full of natural charm, as if it were one with the sky.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">It was truly a wondrous sight!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Finally, the Cloud Whale slowly halted, hovering high in the sky, maintaining a safe distance from Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Despite the Cloud Merchants' worldwide reputation, the Cloud Whale was, after all, a Nascent Soul level existence, so there was still some caution, and it consciously stopped in the sky.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">After a short while, a group of people emerged from within the Cloud Whale, slowly flying towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Fei Si ascended into the sky to meet this group.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Under the watchful eyes of the public, the two sides met in mid-air.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Fei Si was not surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Cloud Merchants' invitation had been submitted over ten days ago.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">After receiving approval from Meng Kui, Fei Si had allowed this Cloud Merchant caravan to come to Fire Persimmon Immortal City for trade.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Lord Fei Si, I am Song Fuli. It is truly an honor to do business in Fire Persimmon Immortal City!" Fei Si nodded and smiled, carefully observing the Golden Core stage cultivator before him.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Song Fuli was a middle-aged man with ordinary features, broad nostrils, and a pair of tiger-like eyes that shone brightly, giving the impression of a battle-hardened general rather than a businessman.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">After a brief greeting, Fei Si requested to inspect Song Fuli's Cloud Merchant identity token and the documents issued by the Flying Cloud Kingdom.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Fei Si carefully examined the identity token, then unfolded the documents to check for the seals of the Flying Cloud Kingdom and the Southern Bean Kingdom.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Once everything was confirmed to be in order, he returned the token and documents to Song Fuli.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Mr. Song, please follow me." Fei Si led Song Fuli back to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Song Fuli, accompanied by several others, first followed Fei Si into the city, while the rest of his group began signaling for more people to emerge from the Cloud Whale.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">A large group of cloud beasts, in various forms such as cloud horses and cloud oxen, dragged numerous cargo boxes in a long line, slowly flying towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The citizens became excited, with some even raising their hands in cheer.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">They engaged in lively discussions.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"It seems the area west of the city was cleared early on."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"It appears the City Lord's Mansion had already made arrangements, designating that area specifically for the Cloud Merchants to set up shop."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"I've never seen such a large-scale caravan before. I wonder what kind of novel items they've brought, it's truly exciting." Fire Persimmon Immortal City became bustling with activity.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">At Ning Zhuo's residence.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The sixteen-year-old young cultivator also stood by the window, gazing at a corner of the sky through the window.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"The Flying Cloud Kingdom's caravan, huh?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo showed a hint of anticipation.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In fact, he had always had a favorable impression of the Cloud Kingdom, as his mother hailed from the Flying Cloud Kingdom.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Song Fuli and Fei Si traveled together.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">During the descent, Song Fuli looked down at the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City, noticing a scar in the middle, a ruin left from a previous Golden Core battle.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Song Fuli showed a trace of concern: "I wonder how your City Lord views the recent Golden Core battle?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Fei Si quickly reassured him: "It was merely because Lord Meng Kui did not intervene. The previous battle was far from reaching the level where he needed to act! Your caravan can rest assured, everything is under the control of our City Lord's Mansion."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Song Fuli sighed lightly: "Fire Persimmon Immortal City is a newly established city, a genuine new city, and because of the presence of the Lava Immortal Palace, the protective formation is not yet fully laid out."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"The emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace might be a good thing. Perhaps it's an opportunity for the Immortal City Grand Formation to be reestablished." "However, before that, I hope the caravans entering the city have the ability to protect themselves."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Fei Si nodded slightly, glancing at the cultivators behind Song Fuli.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">These cultivators had a fierce demeanor, some with scars on their faces, others with cold, piercing gazes, clearly all skilled fighters.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Cloud Merchants, capable of traveling the world and doing business everywhere, naturally had strong martial support.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Nascent Soul level Cloud Whale was one layer of protection, and the caravan's guards and cultivators were evidently the second layer.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Fei Si pondered: "As long as your caravan adheres to the standards we previously agreed upon, carrying equipment that meets or is below the standard, we will approve."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Song Fuli smiled: "That's good."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He needed to conduct business and make money here, while Fei Si, representing the City Lord's Mansion, needed to meet the demands of a large number of visiting cultivators.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The resources Fire Persimmon Immortal City could provide were insufficient to meet the massive demand from the visiting cultivators.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ultimately, Fire Persimmon Immortal City was still a new city, never having accommodated so many visiting cultivators before.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Previously, Fire Persimmon Immortal City could be self-sufficient, but now, the demand was so great that businesses in all sectors of Fire Persimmon Immortal City were booming, yet still unable to satisfy buyers.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">This situation led to a series of public security issues, increasingly affecting the City Lord's Mansion's stable governance of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Cloud Merchants made money, the vast number of cultivators received a substantial supply of resources, and the City Lord's Mansion could maintain public order and collect a significant amount of taxes.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This was a win-win situation for everyone.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">As a result, the Cloud Merchants were warmly welcomed upon their arrival.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">They quickly set up numerous shops, tents, and even erected tall buildings on the vacant land in the west of the city.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">From the first day of business, the Cloud Merchants' goods sold out!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">On the second day, Ning Zhuo donned a simple mask magical artifact, slightly altering his appearance, and left his residence to visit the Cloud Merchants' shops in the west of the city.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">In just one day, the west side had undergone a dramatic transformation.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Various shops stood tall, all bearing the characteristics of the Flying Cloud Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">These pure white, gray-white, and mottled white buildings were generally tall and slender, as if reaching for the clouds.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">In contrast, the buildings on the Fire Persimmon Immortal City side were built very wide and thick, giving a sense of solidity.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The thicker the building, the better it could insulate against temperature.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The temperature around Fire Persimmon Mountain was still generally high.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In contrast, the Flying Cloud Kingdom had a suitable climate, but with frequent rain and thunderstorms.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The taller the buildings, the better they could collect rainwater and utilize lightning and strong winds.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo walked among these shops, experiencing the exotic atmosphere of the Flying Cloud Kingdom.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The area was bustling with people, and his ears were filled with a constant hum of voices, from haggling to playful banter.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City had entered a festive atmosphere due to the arrival of the Cloud Merchants.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo chose a material shop to enter.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He needed to purchase some clouds as materials to refine into his Floating Cloud Cloak.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The clouds produced by the Floating Cloud Cloak were not just a result of mana; each use also consumed the cloud threads stored within the cloak.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The material shop was bustling, with many people purchasing these basic materials.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">After inquiring about the price, Ning Zhuo bought some clouds and also purchased some cloud threads.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Clouds were considered raw materials, while the cloud threads had undergone a processing step, making them more expensive than the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
