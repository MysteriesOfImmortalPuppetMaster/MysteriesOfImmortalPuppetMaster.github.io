<paragraph index="1">The interior of the room was bone-chilling, with a thin layer of white frost condensed upon the floor and walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The refinement of Snow Pivot Guard Xie had reached its most critical stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This time, Ning Zhuo's refinement of the mechanical puppet differed from his previous attempts. Not only had he summoned Gongsun Yan to assist him, but he had also boldly altered the sequence of refinement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">In the past, he typically worked from the inside out - starting from the foundation core and moving toward the auxiliary components. This time, however, he had already completed the majority of the external form for Snow Pivot Guard Xie, leaving the design of the most central hub component for the very end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This was because the new core of Snow Pivot Guard Xie utilized Nascent Soul-level Eternal Stillness Profound Ice. For Ning Zhuo, who was only at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment, this represented a significant challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Gongsun Yan once again activated his Innate Heartfire. The flames moved as naturally as his own limbs, extraordinary and agile, as they wrapped around a piece of Eternal Stillness Profound Ice and began to slowly lick at its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, mobilized his divine sense and manipulated his tools to begin carving the material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">His carving skills and refinement expertise were no longer what they used to be. With the powerful assistance of the Heartfire, the shape of the core gradually began to manifest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"It is finished!" More than an hour later, Ning Zhuo exhaled a mouthful of turbid qi, his body and mind utterly exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"We actually succeeded!!" Gongsun Yan's face was filled with pleasant surprise. Drenched in sweat, he was overcome with a profound sense of achievement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The two set aside their tools and took a brief rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Processing Nascent Soul-level precious materials was still a task that far exceeded Ning Zhuo’s current capacity. Although the actual amount of Eternal Stillness Profound Ice used for the core wasn't large, the effort required for Ning Zhuo to handle it was immense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">While this step was a success, it allowed Ning Zhuo to probe the current limits of his refinement abilities. He found it extremely difficult to command Nascent Soul-level materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">It wasn't that he couldn't force it - as he had done here by adjusting design plans to bypass many difficulties - but the practice proved he was still barely managing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">It seems I can only manage to use Nascent Soul-level materials for specific mechanical components, he thought. And such designs cannot be overly complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo took out a Five Elements Golden Core Wheel and placed it inside the spherical core component. Finally, he inserted Ning Xie's spirituality, completing the assembly of the core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Upon Ning Zhuo’s command, the spirituality reacted immediately. Using the Five Elements Golden Core Wheel, it surged with a burst of Golden Core spiritual energy. As the energy passed through the spherical shell, it was instantly converted into the ice attribute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The ice-attribute energy flowed along the unfinished torso, rapidly covering and spreading across it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo controlled the speed of the energy's spread while he and Gongsun Yan acted together, using molten Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Heart Iron to quickly construct the final parts of the skeleton. Afterward, they filled the structure with Profound Ice Essence, serving as "marrow meridians" for the flow of energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Because they had prior experience, they finished this step quickly. The entire process was as smooth as flowing water, their control over the heat and timing reaching a level of perfection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Once this stage was complete, Gongsun Yan took over the task of inspection and refinement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo’s fingers flew as he continuously commanded Ning Xie’s spirituality to drive the ice-attribute energy, condensing strands of energy threads within the mechanical puppet's body. These threads crisscrossed, weaving into a complex network of meridians that covered the skeleton.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">These ice-attribute demonic tendons were not only responsible for conducting energy; they also possessed extreme tenacity and elasticity, providing the mechanical body with additional power and cushioning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Under Ning Zhuo’s meticulous weaving, the body of the mechanical puppet gradually took shape. Its curves were smooth, possessing both strength and aesthetic beauty. The Profound Ice material made it crystal clear, emitting a faint, deep, and restrained blue luster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The profound meanings of the Eternal Stillness Profound Ice Body Casting Demonic Art and the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art were perfectly reflected and integrated within this mechanical body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo suddenly had an epiphany: Under normal circumstances, a cultivator cannot simultaneously practice both the Eternal Stillness Profound Ice Body Casting Demonic Art and the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art. However, within a mechanical construct, the principles of these two arts can be ingeniously merged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Mechanical arts gather the strengths of a hundred schools. It is like painting on white paper; it lacks the various shackles that a human body is born with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The work was not yet finished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo had retained the original Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor in his design. Consequently, he proceeded to forge a layer of hexagonal armor plates onto the ice-carved body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor formed a second layer of protection. The Ice Mirror Helmet, which possessed reconnaissance functions, was re-refined with sharper, more aggressive lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Roaring Ice Flood Dragon beast heads on the pauldrons were kept, but the Aurora Glazed Crystal embedded in their eyes underwent special treatment. More formations were laid out, deepening the control and increasing the limit of the surging energy. As a result, the cold light was contained within and no longer conspicuous. Once it erupted, its power would undoubtedly be even more terrifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The six Cold Steel Mechanical Spheres also received formation upgrades to ensure they kept pace with the improvements of the main puppet body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Finally...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"It’s done! It’s done!" Gongsun Yan stepped back a few paces, his eyes wide as he stared at Snow Pivot Guard Xie before him. Though exhausted, a powerful surge of excitement filled his body, making him nearly tremble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The new Snow Pivot Guard Xie stood silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Her height had increased slightly to about six and a half feet. Compared to before, her external changes were not obvious. She still wore the ice helmet and the Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor, with the ice flood dragon heads on her shoulders. The six Cold Steel Mechanical Spheres circled her silently like loyal guards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">But Ning Zhuo, having the original to compare it to, easily saw that this Snow Pivot Guard Xie had undergone a massive internal upgrade!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Freezing cold air was solidified within her, and a faint azure spiritual light flowed between the gaps of her armor plates. A deep, ice-attribute power was like the hidden part of an iceberg at sea, making one look forward to the day he would unleash that force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"You did very well this time. Go back and get some rest," Ning Zhuo praised Gongsun Yan. Without the latter, completing this task would likely have taken at least twice the time and energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In the most critical step - the refinement of the Nascent Soul-level Eternal Stillness Profound Ice - Gongsun Yan's Heartfire had been of immense help. One had to realize that if one were slightly careless with such a treasure, it would explode, releasing a sonic cold tide. A cultivator handling this had to be extremely cautious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Heartfire, being best suited for delicate refinement, was the perfect tool for the job.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"The refinement went very smoothly. To succeed on the first try is no small feat," Ning Zhuo was also very satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"However..." He looked at the puppet. "Though the machine is new, it requires combat testing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Snow Pivot Guard Xie has had very little actual combat. In this regard, she isn't even as good as Snow-Colored Maiden Hui."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo quietly planned his next move. Creating the mechanical puppet was only the starting point. Next, she needed to be tested, polished, and improved through combat until it reached a state where no further changes could be made.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Perhaps Situ Xing or Ban Ji would be suitable targets for training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Just as this thought occurred to him, Old Chef knocked on the formation, informing him of a message from Chen San. Ning Zhuo received the message and scanned it with his divine sense, taking in all the information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Chen San was responsible for intelligence gathering, and this time he brought two major pieces of news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The first concerned Ban Ji. He was currently in seclusion using a pill. The Ban Family had procured a Hundred-Refined Golden Body Pill specifically for him. The Ban Family had not hidden this news; instead, they announced it openly to boost Ban Ji's popularity and morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">In that case, I can put the matter of Ban Ji aside for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The second major piece of intelligence concerned the Confucian cultivator group. The leader of the Confucian group had become the outsider, Zhao Hansheng. This happened because Duanmu Zhang had voluntarily stepped down to make way for him, and Chu Xuangui and the others showed no signs of opposition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">This information was truly strange and shocking. The Confucian group was now widely announcing that they had hired Zhao Hansheng to serve as the new Mountain Master specifically to promote the Mind Study of Confucianism. According to the agreement, Zhao Hansheng would open related courses. The first three would be public lectures, and a wide range of cultivators were warmly invited to participate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">So that’s how it is. Mind Study... What kind of school is this? It must be of immense value, otherwise the Confucian group wouldn't make such a grand move!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">There was also a third piece of intelligence showing Gu Qing’s recent movements. This genius cultivator from the Huazhang Kingdom was acting very high-profile, using clones to discuss Confucian classics and techniques everywhere, earning widespread praise. His prestige was rising rapidly, especially among the Confucian group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo stared at the message for a full ten breaths of time. His brow furrowed tighter and tighter as he sank into a state of great concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">An ordinary cultivator might not sense it, but Ning Zhuo, who was well-versed in the games of the Righteous Path, was very sensitive to such shifts. He realized that following this sudden change, he had already suffered a significant loss - and this loss was continuing and would only grow in the future!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">This is an exchange of interests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Confucian group of the Myriad Manifestations Sect is using the position of Mountain Master to trade for the teaching of Mind Study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The problem is, what does Zhao Hansheng want the Mountain Master position for? On the surface, it’s for a matching status to facilitate teaching. But in reality, that is merely a high-sounding excuse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Gu Qing is striking out in all directions with a high profile just to rapidly increase his fame. Most of the people he chooses to debate have Confucian attainments that are leagues apart from his own. To him, there is no value in such exchanges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">And yet, Gu Qing is attacking broadly, and...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Furthermore, Gu Qing had never visited the Bluestone Grotto, showing not even a hint of interest in contacting Ning Zhuo. This once again caused Ning Zhuo to scent an ill omen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Confucian group's support for me will inevitably plummet following this change!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">A group that originally leaned toward me is undergoing a shift in attitude. This loss will only grow larger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">How long will Zhao Hansheng stay here? In this matter, he holds the complete initiative!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">This is difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Now that he is the Mountain Master, it will be hard for me to use the power of the Confucian group in the future. Unless I contact him and Gu Qing to reach some sort of private agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But the difficulty of that was immense. The Confucian group had helped Ning Zhuo because of their own values, for Wen Ruanyu, and for the interests of the White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">But would Zhao Hansheng? For Ning Zhuo to induce his help, he would inevitably have to pay a much higher price. Looking back at the previous Confucian group, had they required Ning Zhuo to pay a price? Hardly! Comparing the two, the difference was obvious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo had always been seeking the most suitable entry point to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect. The Confucian group, situated in the middle layer of the sect, possessed value. But now, this entry point option was being lost to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The principle that "a just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust one finds little" was something everyone understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">When Demonic Cultivators acted, they could simply kill, fight, and charge head-on. If they were in a bad mood, they acted willfully and arrogantly. They often used force to break a deadlock. If they couldn't, their end was usually miserable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Righteous Path was not played that way. It was gentler, but also more complex. A true master of the Righteous Path began laying their pieces very early. A move made decades or even a century ago might finally secure the victory of a long-term plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">In the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had focused his studies on this. He read books and observed families and the City Lord's Mansion. When he reviewed events, he discovered that many things appearing to happen in the moment actually had their most important seeds sown many years prior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The most appropriate time to solve many problems was not when the problem erupted, but at a suitable point in time beforehand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The appearance of Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing is an accident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But between the two of them, one has occupied the highest position, and the other has become the most prominent genius among the younger generation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Because of them, the link between the Confucian group and me is weakening rapidly, even showing a trend of being cut off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Confucian group was supposed to set four Cloud Sea trials for Ning Zhuo. Comparing them to the third trial, it was clear they no longer revolved around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Oftentimes, it was just like that. There was only one seat. If someone else occupied it, you didn't have it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Most cultivators might not have this awareness, but Ning Zhuo realized his predicament and thought: Perhaps I should do something now, rather than watching as the situation worsens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">However, Zhao Hansheng was a famous Great Scholar who had bested Duanmu Zhang in debate. Gu Qing was even more famous in the Huazhang Kingdom, an absolute genius. Ning Zhuo was merely at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment. The Confucian group, which he could have relied on most, was now rapidly gravitating toward those two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">How should I proceed?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo pondered for a long time before finally writing to Chen San to explain his plan. Upon receiving the plan, Chen San's heart shook: Why does the Young Master want to target these two powerful outsiders, Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Regardless, the Young Master must have a reason for doing this. As a subordinate, I will simply follow orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This sort of thing belonged to the realm of political struggle, which was indeed difficult for ordinary people to understand. But Chen San acted immediately, and soon, a wave of rumors began to rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Gu Qing is truly a once-in-a-century genius! In a single day, he convinced more than ten cultivators of his generation. This includes Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, Kong Ran, and others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"The Huazhang Kingdom is a sacred land for Confucianism. Even though Gu Qing is young, his name as a genius is spread throughout the country. He is a genius among geniuses!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"A famous master produces a fine disciple - the ancients did not deceive me! His teacher, Zhao Hansheng, had no sooner arrived at the Myriad Manifestations Sect than he completely convinced the Great Scholar Duanmu Zhang and seized the position of Mountain Master. Tsk, tsk, truly incredible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">For a time, the names of Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing filled the ears of the public. The rumors were extremely dense and became more and more exaggerated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">So much so that when the public heard them, they soon began to feel a general sense of annoyance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Why is it this pair of Confucian teacher and student again? Why are they everywhere?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This is too exaggerated. Is the reality truly like this?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">In this way, the situation began to undergo a subtle transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
