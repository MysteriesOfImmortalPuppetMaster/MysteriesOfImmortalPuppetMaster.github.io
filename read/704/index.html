<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Liu Fushu caught sight of the scene and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. Thank goodness! Bai Jiyun made the same mistake as me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Hold on, I still have a chance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">After making a series of errors, Liu Fushu finally realized the crux of the challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Gritting his teeth, he slowed his pace to its absolute limit, meticulously writing each stroke with deliberate slowness, suppressing his instincts. He finally managed to advance steadily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">However, this meant he had fallen far behind and lacked the means to quickly catch up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Liu Fushu grew inwardly anxious, but seeing Bai Jiyun's predicament immediately eased his pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">A pang of shame struck him. If Brother Bai wins, I should be happy for him. He's my friend, and I shouldn't be gloating over his misfortune. This isn't the conduct of a gentleman!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Bai Jiyun failed over a dozen times, his face ashen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After a few stunned breaths, he exhaled a turbid qi and abruptly stopped writing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Frowning in deep concentration, he sank into profound contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">So, the difficulty of this bizarre question lies here!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"But why would Mr. Chu Xuangui design the trial this way?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Cultivators with deeper calligraphic skill are actually at a disadvantage. This is supposed to be a Confucian Flying Cloud Minor Trial, yet it favors those with only a superficial grasp of calligraphy. Is that fair?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Bai Jiyun scanned the surrounding cultivators, his gaze settling on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">To his eyes, Ning Zhuo lacked any visible Literary Qi, suggesting he wasn't a Confucian cultivator. Yet, with his solid foundation in talisman strokes, Ning Zhuo had steadily advanced, now firmly holding second place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In a typical Confucian Minor Trial, such a scenario would be virtually impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">And the first-place contender...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Bai Jiyun's gaze fixed on Kong Ran.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">A sudden thought surfaced in his divine sea: "Ideographic Brush, Prodigy... Could it be that this Flying Cloud Minor Trial was specifically designed for Kong Ran?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Liu Fushu, with his limited experience, wouldn't have considered such a possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">But Bai Jiyun was different. He wasn't merely sightseeing; he had traveled extensively throughout the Flying Cloud Kingdom, immersing himself in its diverse customs and gaining a deep understanding of its social dynamics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"If my guess is correct..." Bai Jiyun turned to Chu Xuangui, a flicker of disdain in his eyes. "It's hard to imagine that Mr. Chu Xuangui, renowned throughout the nation for his meticulousness, impartiality, and iron-fisted justice, would resort to such tactics!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Bai Jiyun had given up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">At this pace, even if he pushed himself to the limit, he couldn't catch up to the top two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">By this point, the situation was clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The vast majority of Confucian cultivators found themselves in the same predicament as Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu - making mistake after mistake, their progress painfully slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The top two competitors remained far ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the true victor would emerge from this pair!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"I'm going to win!" Kong Ran hadn't forgotten to observe his rivals. When he realized he was in first place, his face lit up with joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Liu Fushu refused to give up, still giving it his all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Chu Xuangui remained expressionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo, on the other hand, maintained a calm demeanor, appearing unhurried yet steadily advancing, never letting Kong Ran widen the gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After several more poems, more and more Confucian cultivators realized the insurmountable gap and gradually withdrew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">They gathered to watch, buzzing with speculation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Who's that big-headed youth?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"I never imagined Kong Ran would ultimately win the Ideographic Brush!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"He's a prodigy, after all, and has been carefully selecting his Dao Path. No wonder Mr. Chu Xuangui brought out the Ideographic Brush - it was likely because of Kong Ran's arrival."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Realizing Kong Ran was likely being favored and would soon be inducted into the core circle of Confucian cultivators within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Confucian cultivators began cheering him on enthusiastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Compared to Ning Zhuo, who was clearly an outsider, they preferred this young cultivator with a brighter future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The atmosphere grew feverish, as if Kong Ran had already been declared the ultimate victor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Yet Ning Zhuo remained unnoticed, maintaining his pursuit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Kong Ran made a mistake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">His mental state faltered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The crowd's adulation and expectations weighed heavily on his young heart, adding external pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">One mistake meant rewriting the entire piece.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Kong Ran had to start over. In his haste, he glanced back to check Ning Zhuo's progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Though Ning Zhuo hadn't surpassed him, the gap between them had vanished almost entirely after Kong Ran's error.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"I can't afford to make another mistake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"The Ideographic Brush must be mine!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Kong Ran grew increasingly anxious. Steeling his resolve, he activated his Innate Talent, channeling Literary Qi to unleash a Confucian technique:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Cradle of Myriad Phenomena!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo was startled, finally lifting his gaze to Kong Ran. "That familiar aura... Could his Innate Talent also be... Early Wisdom?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Empowered by the Confucian technique, Kong Ran's eyes became as clear as water, like those of an infant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">His memories were suppressed to the deepest recesses of his mind, leaving him like a newborn child encountering the world for the first time. He observed everything before him with the fresh eyes of a first encounter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Though still young and not yet old enough to attend school, Kong Ran's father was one of the Flying Cloud Kingdom's most powerful prime ministers. Recognizing his son's Innate Talent, his father had hired private tutors to guide Kong Ran in various subjects from a very young age.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">While his calligraphy skills couldn't match those of Liu Fushu, Bai Jiyun, and others, he possessed a solid foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Now, under the influence of the Cradle of Myriad Phenomena, everything around Kong Ran appeared entirely new. Beyond their novelty, these objects became his childhood primers, continuously inspiring and guiding him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">With this, Kong Ran's previous calligraphy foundation no longer hindered him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">His writing speed increased by another thirty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">In moments, he had widened the gap between himself and Ning Zhuo, and the distance continued to grow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The cultivators were astonished and began discussing the phenomenon excitedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Is this Innate Talent?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Rumor has it that Kong Ran possesses the Innate Talent of Early Wisdom. It seems the rumors were true!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"With such talent, Kong Ran is certain to win this competition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Liu Fushu's eyes were bloodshot. Seeing Kong Ran's writing speed accelerate further, he finally gave up in despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The gap was simply too vast, leaving Liu Fushu no hope of catching up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">At the same time, he found himself thinking along the same lines as Bai Jiyun: "This year's Flying Cloud Minor Trial is different from previous years. The questions are strange, and the rewards are excessive. Could it truly be a scheme to lure Kong Ran onto the path of Confucian cultivation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">By now, no other cultivator remained in the competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After Kong Ran activated his Innate Talent Technique, he left everyone else in the dust. The cultivators instantly recognized the futility of their efforts and withdrew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Only Ning Zhuo persisted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">After a while, the cultivators grew impatient. The gap between Ning Zhuo and Kong Ran had become insurmountable, yet Ning Zhuo showed no sign of giving up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Is there any point in continuing like this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Face reality! Your opponent is a prodigy with Innate Talent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"I understand this big-headed youth. He once saw a glimmer of hope for victory, but when Kong Ran revealed his true depth, that hope turned to despair. The sudden shift was too much for him to bear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Hmph, he's not even a true Confucian cultivator - just an outsider. He probably joined the Flying Cloud Minor Trial out of curiosity, just to play around. How dare someone with such a shallow foundation try to steal treasures from us Confucian cultivators?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"That's a bit harsh. Kong Ran isn't a true Confucian cultivator either."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"But Kong Ran is only at the Qi Refining Stage, while this youth has already reached Foundation Establishment. Having already chosen his path of cultivation, why be so greedy, trying to snatch advantages from the Confucian cultivator's path?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Hmm, you're right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The cultivators' murmurs reached Ning Zhuo's ears, clearly intended for him to hear. Yet he remained deaf to their words, continuing to act as he pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Chu Xuangui observed this scene and nodded inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Setting aside everything else, Ning Zhuo's composure alone, at his age, was remarkable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">At this stage of the Flying Cloud Minor Trial, Kong Ran held a commanding lead, yet Chu Xuangui remained calm, showing no signs of panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Chu Xuangui was well aware of Kong Ran's intelligence, including his Early Wisdom and Innate Talent Technique. These were all part of his calculations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Without betraying any emotion, Chu Xuangui continued to condense poems using his spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">With each poem completed, Kong Ran's face grew paler. Fine beads of cold sweat dotted his forehead, and his upper body began to sway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He was nearing his limit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Activating the Innate Talent Technique drained not only physical stamina and spiritual energy but also mental focus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">In the past, he had used the Cradle of Myriad Phenomena to aid his studies, but he had never sustained it for such an extended period.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The crushing burden forced him to his breaking point, and Kong Ran was forced to deactivate the Innate Talent Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">His head swam, golden light flashing in his vision. He turned weakly toward Ning Zhuo, a chill running through him. "Why is this guy still going?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Kong Ran began making frequent errors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">His condition had deteriorated so badly that he had to rewrite each line of poetry seven or eight times before it met the standard, barely passing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">And each poem required at least four lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">By the time Kong Ran finished a single poem, Ning Zhuo had completed four or five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Under these circumstances, Ning Zhuo steadily began to close the gap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The assembled cultivators fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Few had anticipated such a dramatic reversal in the later stages of the competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"That's right. Kong Ran may be a prodigy, but he's still only at the Qi Refining Stage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"He can't sustain a prolonged battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Compared to someone at the Foundation Establishment Stage, his reserves are far too weak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"What a pity. If I'd known this would happen, I wouldn't have given up!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The cultivators turned their gazes toward Ning Zhuo, their expressions complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Moments later, Kong Ran collapsed to the ground, unable to maintain his focus any longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu rushed to his side, helping him regain consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Kong Ran lay limp, his weary eyes fixed on Ning Zhuo as he surpassed him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Ah, my Ideographic Brush!" His eyes rolled back in fury, and he fainted again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Chu Xuangui slowly ceased channeling his spiritual energy, no longer conjuring characters in the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">His expression remained impassive as he turned to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The cultivators fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">After a few breaths, Chu Xuangui nodded slightly and said calmly, "You are the victor of this Flying Cloud Minor Trial. What is your name?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo bowed respectfully, his voice trembling slightly as he announced his name, subtly conveying his excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Very well." Chu Xuangui immediately retrieved a token and presented it to Ning Zhuo along with the Ideographic Brush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Chu Xuangui surveyed the assembled Confucian cultivators and spoke in a deep voice, "In ancient times, Ancestor Cang created written characters, leaving behind the Primordial Seal Stele. This stele is a National Artifact of the Hua Zhang Kingdom, and they have long sought a worthy successor to inherit its legacy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Yet countless Confucian cultivators, whether prodigies or great masters, have failed before the Primordial Seal Stele."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Though we belong to the Myriad Manifestations Sect, we retain the authority to make recommendations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Recently, during a conversation with a friend, I gained a new insight: Ancestor Cang's creation of characters was inspired by the forms of talismans, leading to the development of the Primordial Seal Script."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"If Confucian cultivators have proven inadequate, why not approach the matter from the source of Ancestor Cang's inspiration - the art of talisman-making?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Upon hearing this, the Confucian cultivators collectively showed expressions of sudden realization.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">A complex expression crossed Chu Xuangui's face as he turned to Ning Zhuo. "You are not a Confucian cultivator, but that does not matter. I hope you will make good use of this Ideographic Brush to enhance your talisman-making skills. If you can also study the Confucian classics, all the better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"When you have achieved mastery and gained confidence, bring this token to me. If you pass the assessment, we will recommend you to the Hua Zhang Kingdom to attempt the Primordial Seal Stele."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Bai Jiyun's brow unfurrowed. "So that's it! As expected of Mr. Chu Xuangui. I had underestimated his wisdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Liu Fushu clenched his fists, his voice tinged with regret. "What a missed opportunity! By failing to win, I've also lost my chance to study the Primordial Seal Stele."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Mr. Chu Xuangui truly lives up to his reputation as a senior figure in the Confucian School, always fair and impartial. He didn't let Kong Ran's Early Wisdom and Innate Talent influence his judgment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"His decision to award victory in the Flying Cloud Minor Trial to an outsider proves his integrity and moral character!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Kong Ran remained unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo watched as Chu Xuangui's words effortlessly swayed the crowd, completely clearing him of suspicion. A glint flashed in his eyes as he thought, Impressive! I've learned something valuable today.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo bowed deeply to Chu Xuangui, expressing his gratitude and praising the elder's virtuous conduct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Chu Xuangui, however, seemed reluctant to grow too close to Ning Zhuo. After urging everyone to focus on their studies, he turned and departed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">With the Golden Core elder gone, the atmosphere on the peak immediately relaxed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Many Confucian cultivators gathered around Ning Zhuo, eager to befriend him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Ning Zhuo welcomed them all with a warm smile, maintaining a humble and approachable demeanor that put everyone at ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Finally, he approached Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and the still-unconscious Kong Ran. "Fellow Daoists, our meeting here today must be fate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"It's lunchtime now. Would you honor me by accepting my treat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Bai Jiyun and Liu Fushu exchanged a glance and nodded in unison. "We accept."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The banquet was held at the Green Stone Cave Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ning Zhuo introduced Old Chef, Qing Chi, and Gongsun Yan to the trio, prompting another round of meaningful glances between Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Though Ning Zhuo's attire was plain, the presence of three attendants and his refined demeanor clearly indicated he was no ordinary commoner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The three cultivators immediately revised their assessment of Ning Zhuo, elevating him by a degree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Even without resorting to his signature Dark Cuisine, Old Chef prepared a feast of exquisite dishes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">While Bai Jiyun and Kong Ran ate heartily, Liu Fushu, despite his attempts at restraint, found himself indulging more than he intended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">After several rounds of wine, Kong Ran bit into a chicken leg and finally spoke. "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, are you willing to sell that Ideographic Brush? My father is one of the current prime ministers of the Flying Cloud Kingdom. If you're interested, name your price!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "The Ideographic Brush enhances cultivation realms, so I have no intention of selling it. However... I have a close acquaintance with innate talent and early wisdom. Fellow Daoist Kong Ran previously demonstrated an Innate Talent Technique. Would you be willing to sell that method? If so, this Ghost Path Golden Core can serve as a deposit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The three cultivators' pupils constricted simultaneously, their gazes fixed on the Ghost Path Golden Core in Ning Zhuo's hand.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
