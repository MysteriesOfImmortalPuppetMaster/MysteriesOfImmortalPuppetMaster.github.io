<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">At once, many eyes filled with envy and jealousy turned toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo exchanged a knowing glance with Sun Lingtong. Both smiled slightly before stepping forward to take the room token from the silver-robed steward's hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The silver-robed steward merely nodded slightly, not saying much publicly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He soon finished distributing all the tokens, impatiently leaving a final instruction before turning to depart: "Take your tokens and occupy your assigned rooms. If you make a mistake, you will bear the consequences yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The token was a magical artifact. Ning Zhuo infused it with his divine sense, quickly following its guidance to a small house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The door was slightly ajar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong exchanged another wary glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sun Lingtong took the lead, carefully pushing open the door. Immediately, he saw someone already waiting inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lingtong gasped softly and promptly offered a respectful salute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo also stepped into the room right after, bowing respectfully: "Lord Qing Yan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The person waiting inside was none other than the Golden Core ghostman cultivator Qing Yan, who had previously volunteered to aid White Paper City halfway through their journey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Qing Yan nodded upon seeing Ning Zhuo, stood up, and walked directly to him. "A riot broke out today, and the paper statue at the South Gate was destroyed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"In the coming days, White Paper Immortal City will be under strict control. Both of you must be careful and avoid making any mistakes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"You should know, dealing with the steward of Hidden Yang Manor on your behalf cost me quite a fortune."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"If you violate the city rules and end up imprisoned, I won't have the means to get you out again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This simple explanation immediately clarified why Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had been assigned to Room A-1.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo quickly clasped his hands in gratitude, adding somewhat unnecessarily, "Even if it were not a high-grade room, I’m not someone who cares much about wealth or poverty. Any arrangement would have been acceptable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Qing Yan laughed gently. "Since you've already become a male consort, stay here obediently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"And stop thinking about my daughter; you two aren't suitable for each other."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"With your Jiao family's foundational method, the Triple Furnace True Yang Scripture, you'll surely stand out among the male consorts. Perhaps in half a month's time, you’ll be promoted to the Vigorous Yang Manor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo felt a slight stir in his heart. He inwardly pondered: "Vigorous Yang Manor? So, besides Hidden Yang Manor, there are other residences as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"And judging by Qing Yan's tone, the Vigorous Yang Manor seems to be of a higher rank than the Hidden Yang Manor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He was always sensitive to any new intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Make good use of this room," Qing Yan advised. "It is crucial for newly arrived male consorts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo paused briefly, then asked, "How much money did it cost?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Qing Yan burst out laughing, "Although you’re not suitable for my daughter, we still hail from the same village. Your Jiao family has always been prominent there. Don’t inquire about the bribe I gave to the steward. Consider it a farewell gift from me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"I'm leaving."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Qing Yan patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder decisively before turning and promptly exiting the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Once Qing Yan left, Ning Zhuo securely shut the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Together with Sun Lingtong, he inspected the room thoroughly two or three times before stopping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">They exchanged messages through divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Sun Lingtong proudly said, "See, Ning Zhuo, my plan was flawless. Pretending to be Jiao Ma has allowed us to squeeze quite a few benefits out of Qing Yan’s hand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo nodded. "Indeed, but it was also our good fortune to randomly pick a dead man's identity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong added, "Enough about that. I'm more interested in what's special about this "A-1" Room. Quickly activate the formations using the room token."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The room token wasn't only for communication; it could also activate the room’s magical formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo immediately controlled the token, activating the arrays.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The room contained multiple formations with excellent effects, including a spirit-gathering formation beneficial for cultivation, preservation formations, ice-preservation formations, shadow projection formations, and sound-isolating formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">They descended to the basement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">It was spacious and densely inscribed with array runes and symbols, evidently the most vital location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo manipulated the room token again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Rumble...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">With a loud rumbling sound, the central flooring moved aside, revealing a large well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Woooo...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Eerie whistling echoed from the well, followed by a sharp drop in temperature as a surge of Yin energy flooded forth, visibly thickening into a spectral green wind rising from the opening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Both Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong gazed into the well, their faces reflecting profound astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Such a tremendous surge of Yin energy..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Just what kind of place is this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">According to the information left in the room token, all this Yin energy originated from none other than the City Lord of White Paper City!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t dare believe it. Just what exactly is White Paper City Lord’s identity, to have amassed so much Yin energy?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Isn't she merely a Nascent Soul cultivator? This volume of Yin energy... even a Soul Formation cultivator might struggle to gather it…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were continually exchanging astonished remarks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Both of them had witnessed plenty of extraordinary sights, having personally observed the battle between Du Tiechuan and the Ginseng Dragon King. They understood the magnitude of power a Soul Formation expert could unleash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Yet, the Yin energy accumulating within the well before them was so immense, clearly surpassing ordinary Soul Formation levels - it required a power far beyond the typical realm to contain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">This realization forced Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo to re-evaluate the White Paper City Lord completely. Simultaneously, they both recalled the words of the Bone Crocodile Demon during their assault at the Underworld Flood Dragon River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The demon had claimed that White Paper City Lord had accumulated an excessive amount of Yin energy over the years, reaching a critical point that could no longer be alleviated by the available Yang energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Her condition was precarious - critical even!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">This was precisely why the City-Overthrowing Alliance dared to act so brazenly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Initially, both Sun and Ning had disregarded this as mere intimidation, a strategic bluff to secure battlefield advantages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Now, however, both men were left speechless by the overwhelming truth before their eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“With such massive Yin energy, it's unbelievable she has managed to hold on this long,” Ning Zhuo sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Turns out the Bone Crocodile Demon was surprisingly honest,” Sun Lingtong remarked, shrugging helplessly. “The White Paper City Lord is the only Nascent Soul cultivator here. If she collapses, this entire immortal city will follow.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“Not to mention, if this surge of Yin energy escapes control, the consequences for White Paper Immortal City would be catastrophic.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“This is truly too alarming,” Sun Lingtong muttered with a click of his tongue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo furrowed his brows, his tone grave: “We should quickly find Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer and deduce clues to my mother's heirloom, then leave this place as swiftly as possible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Previously, Ning Zhuo had harbored some ambitions for adventure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">But now, witnessing the scale of this Yin surge firsthand, Ning Zhuo's faith in White Paper City Lord sharply plummeted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Though adventurous by nature, he understood his own limitations clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Back on the battlefield of Two Note Kingdom, I only had opportunities because Soul Formation and Nascent Soul cultivators were locked in a stalemate. I thought White Paper City Lord could at least stabilize the situation. Now, I see that’s incredibly doubtful!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“It's best we flee quickly. That's the responsible choice.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo did not possess a sacrificial spirit for others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Since childhood, he'd endured and schemed, with unimaginable foes such as the City Lord’s residence and Meng Kui, resulting in overwhelming pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Moreover, having been raised under Sun Lingtong’s care and guidance - a man originating from the notorious Void Sect - Ning Zhuo was naturally inclined towards caution and calculation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">In Ning Zhuo’s eyes, White Paper Immortal City was merely a waystation along his journey. Life and death for the masses were but threads of fate. Besides, he had far more crucial tasks ahead!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After examining the room thoroughly, the pair understood its functions clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Indeed, the facilities here were remarkably comprehensive, supported by top-tier formations - a first-time experience for both Sun and Ning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Even the Ten Thousand-Li Traversing Dragon couldn't compare in terms of immediate practicality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">If graded purely on potential, the Wandering Dragon was naturally superior as a true artifact-level treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">However, after its initial crafting, the Wandering Dragon was essentially bare-bones, providing only basic utility, with empty chambers that could greatly benefit from enhancements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Back at the Myriad Medicines Sect, Ning Zhuo had only managed a modest alteration by turning one of its chambers into a spirit plant greenhouse. Even then, it was merely a small modification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“I'm going to cultivate,” Ning Zhuo announced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sun Lingtong waved dismissively, “Go ahead, I'll stand guard.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Entering the cultivation chamber, Ning Zhuo ignored the spirit-gathering arrays. Sitting cross-legged, he quickly closed his eyes and began meditating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Three Constellations Treasure Talisman, affixed to his forehead, chest, and navel, emitted gentle, warm glows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Dantian. Five Elements Qi Regulation Dantian. Demonic Blood Vein  Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Each of the three Qi seas radiated their unique energies, continually absorbing and blending the essence from the others, resulting in an abundance of treasure medicine within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This was the second stage of Foundation Establishment: Nourishing the Treasure Medicine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">At the very beginning of cultivation, Ning Zhuo experienced roaring in his ears and bright whiteness before his eyes - a sensation akin to witnessing the world's creation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Gradually, as he acclimated, this profound sensation diminished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">As treasure medicine proliferated within him, each cultivation session felt akin to basking in a gentle spring breeze. His essence, energy, and spirit unified seamlessly, his cultivation flaws dwindled, and harmony among the three aspects deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Yet now, the sensations during cultivation were plain, as dull as drinking tasteless water. However, this wasn’t a negative sign - it symbolized Ning Zhuo nearing the completion of this Nourishing the Treasure Medicine stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The integration of Ning Zhuo's essence, energy, and spirit was nearing perfection, reaching the utmost limit of harmony among his three dantians. Their mutual adaptation had reached a point beyond further improvement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Inexplicably, Ning Zhuo sensed a profound intuition: "The nurturing of the treasured medicine will soon reach its conclusion within the next few days."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This realization spurred him into greater enthusiasm, diligently diving into relentless cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong observed Ning Zhuo’s diligent practice with delight: "Little Zhuo's energy is becoming extremely restrained; it won't be long before he breaks through."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">After finishing his cultivation session, Ning Zhuo confirmed Sun Lingtong's speculation. Yet, Sun Lingtong felt puzzled. "Little Zhuo, your sudden intuition is rather peculiar."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Isn't it simply because I've accumulated deep foundations?" Ning Zhuo asked in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Sun Lingtong shook his head. "Such foresight usually comes from mastering divination techniques or having profound insight, extraordinary talent, or mystical abilities..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo furrowed his brows, immediately recalling his mysterious innate talent. The Five Elements Divine Lord had affirmed he possessed a second talent but had cautioned him not to prematurely uncover it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">After a fruitless discussion, both men felt weary and decided to rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The following morning, Ning Zhuo awoke to find Sun Lingtong already up, with several dishes of spiritual food arranged neatly on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"We are in the first-grade room, and special paper servants delivered our meals," Sun Lingtong explained. "They also conveyed two messages: Firstly, we should rest for three days, after which we’ll choose our cultivation techniques. Secondly, we’re advised to expend yang energy to mitigate the surging yin energy from the well. Even the smallest contribution will count favorably towards future techniques and activities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head in firm refusal. "I can’t do that right now. Perhaps you could offer some instead?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Neutralizing yin energy would inevitably introduce external impurities into his body, disrupting his current crucial breakthrough phase. Sun Lingtong helplessly shrugged. "You're putting me in a tough spot! You know I cultivate a virgin boy technique that retains yang energy. Have you forgotten about your dual cultivation back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo flushed in embarrassment and waved his hands, signaling Sun Lingtong to stop teasing. Sun Lingtong laughed cheekily, teasing him further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"However," Sun Lingtong suddenly suggested, "Little Zhuo, perhaps you've forgotten your Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo paused in realization, then slapped his forehead. "I was so focused on cultivation advancement that I forgot all about it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Sun Lingtong gleefully retrieved the flask from Ning Zhuo to study further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">During his next cultivation session, Ning Zhuo encountered an unexpected halt - the treasured medicines abruptly stopped growing. No matter how he tried to stimulate them, no new medicines emerged, and the feeling of integration between essence, energy, and spirit was bland, almost indistinguishable from regular breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Could this signal my breakthrough?" Ning Zhuo wondered, intensifying his practice. Yet after half a day's intense cultivation, nothing changed. Puzzled, he sought Sun Lingtong’s guidance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Sun Lingtong patiently advised, "Little Zhuo, your anxiety creates instability in your spiritual sea. The final step demands a perfect harmony of essence, energy, and spirit. One mustn't overpower or underwhelm the others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Immediately grasping the essence of Sun Lingtong's advice, Ning Zhuo returned to the cultivation chamber, this time calm and serene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Instantly, the circulating energies in his three seas halted abruptly. Simultaneously, all the treasured medicines trembled and burst, transforming into boundless streams of dazzling, vibrant energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">These brilliant energies surged through his three dantians, expanding them rapidly, multiplying their size more than tenfold. The inner walls of his dantians reconstructed, achieving a qualitative transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Though immense, this vibrant energy ultimately stemmed from the medicines - like water without a source, it soon dissipated entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">With this, Ning Zhuo officially concluded the Nourishing the Treasure Medicine stage, marking his entry into the third stage of Foundation Establishment - the Dantian Birthing Radiance stage!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
