<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 326: Ning Zhuo, Let Go of Your Obsession</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and Meng Yaoyin entered the main hall together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The others remained rooted in place, unable to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu were already dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Meng Chong had made it to the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">It was clear that a life-and-death battle had taken place before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Ze and Ning Xiaoren were lagging behind. They had fled in terror after witnessing Meng Yaoyinâ€™s demonic power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Like statues, they stood frozen in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Meng Chong was about to sit on the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">But even that small distance was like an impassable chasm before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Divine Abilityâ€”Fate Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">As Ning Zhuo recovered some strength, he activated this divine ability with full force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Who among those present hadnâ€™t been marked by his Fate Thread?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Even Meng Chong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He had been marked back when Ning Zhuo entered the Lava Immortal Palace and fought the Golden Blood Battle Ape, Da Sheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Because of this, Ning Zhuo had been able to track Meng Chong's movements during critical moments and pursue him even after a large number of lower-level cultivators had stormed in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Because of this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit understood deeply that Meng Chong would never be able to defeat Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Fate Thread could even be used to fight those above oneâ€™s level. With his Foundation Establishment cultivation, Ning Zhuo could theoretically threaten Jindan cultivators, let alone deal with Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Spare me, Ning Zhuo! I was wrong! I swear, I will never go against you again!" Ning Xiaoren, frozen in place, pleaded in panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Ning Zhuo! Iâ€™m your uncle! If you kill me, wonâ€™t you fear public condemnation?" Ning Zeâ€™s eyes widened, terror written all over his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo ignored them, his eyes cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He grabbed Meng Chong by the neck and pulled out his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Meng Yaoyinâ€™s face was filled with disgust as she flicked her finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Two crisp explosions followed, one after the other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Xiaoren and Ning Zeâ€™s heads exploded like watermelons hitting the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Their headless bodies collapsed to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Meng Chong stared in horror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He could only watch as Ning Zhuo and the others approached.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The envoy of the underworld, Qi Bai, took the lead, arriving behind Meng Chong first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He captured Meng Chongâ€™s soul, compressing it into a ball and holding it in his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Then he retreated, making way for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit remained hidden, cautiously controlling the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon from afar, still evading Zhu Zhenâ€™s pursuit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Everything that happened in the main hall was under its observation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">But what could it do?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Despair was pulling it into the abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">A dull sound echoed, and everyone turned to look.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhu Xuanji, surrounded by golden light, had suppressed his injuries and rushed back into the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Meng Yaoyin, scythe in hand, stepped forward to meet him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The fierce battle resumed in an instant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Taking advantage of the distraction, Ning Zhuo reached the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">His gaze swept over Meng Chongâ€™s body, which then slumped sideways like a statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo stepped over the body and faced the throne, slowly sitting down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">This simple action was monumental in its significance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"The third round of the palace trials is over! The new palace masterâ€”Ning Zhuo!" A voice declared, "All others are disqualified."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Thus, the competition for the position of the Lava Immortal Palace Master came to an end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The news spread, and Zhu Xuanji froze. "So Ning Zhuo was the true candidate for entry all along!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">At the doors of the secret pavilion, the Jindan cultivators, debating whether to storm the main hall, hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Sigh, Zhu Xuanji lost as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Who would have thought that the Lava Immortal Palace would fall into the hands of the Kongmen Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Their plans ran deep. The entire Zheng family was tricked, and that Night Rain Demon Weapon is terrifying!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The cultivators lost their will to fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The once proud Book Spirit, now reduced to just his upper body, looked toward the door in despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He had once faced such a door, only the requirement then had been to piece together the correct version of the Bloodstained Demonic Meridian Skill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"I was just one step away from escaping the Secret Pavilion!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Bloodstained Demonic Meridian Skill! Why didnâ€™t I obtain it?!" The Book Spirit was filled with regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Little Zhuo, you did it. Youâ€™ve become the palace master!" Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo, sitting on the throne, overwhelmed with joy and relief, nearly moved to tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Little Zhuo, it hasnâ€™t been easy for you to get here," Sun Lingtong sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">But Ning Zhuo shook his head. "No, I havenâ€™t succeeded yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He leaned back in the throne, his fingers caressing the armrests, lost in thought. He imagined the time when his mother, as an overseer, had sat in this same seat, taking partial control of the palace masterâ€™s duties. What was it like then? How did it feel?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Lava Immortal Palace Overview had described it many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sitting on the throne, Meng Yaoyin had been able to control many mechanical structures, including the medical hall and the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At this moment, Ning Zhuo, now the true palace master, could feel all the mechanical structures of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">But it was this deep connection that made him painfully aware of the palace's dire state. Nearly all the crucial structures were gone, leaving only the inner hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The outer and inner sections of the Lava Immortal Palace had been swallowed by the beast tide, with only the main hall still standing, where cultivators were holding onto the last line of defense, numb with despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Of the palaceâ€™s full strength, at least seventy percent had been lost!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"The damage is catastrophic!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Rather than repair, it would be better to build a new palace from scratch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Restoring the palace would be a bottomless pit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Fate had played a cruel trick on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After fourteen years of longing, fourteen years of scheming, all he had won was a pile of mechanical ruins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo let out a soft chuckle and activated his technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Funeral Pyre Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Flames erupted, quickly engulfing the throne in an intense blaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Sun Lingtong was alarmed. "Little Zhuo, what are you doing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo stood, continuing to feed the fire with his technique, dragging Meng Chongâ€™s body away from the throne.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He stared at the burning throne and explained to Sun Lingtong, "The Lava Immortal Palace is nearly destroyed. Cremating the throne is my true goal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong was puzzled. He didnâ€™t know that Meng Yaoyin had spent countless years sitting on that throne, pouring her heart and soul into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Just as Ning Xiaohuiâ€™s spirituality had grown from refining the Flowing Cloud Glyph, burning the throne would increase Meng Yaoyinâ€™s spiritual energy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Indeed." Ning Zhuo was pleased to see the throne burning, as traces of spirituality, like fireflies, floated out of the blaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could no longer stay hidden!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">It revealed its dragon-turtle form. "Ning Zhuo, stop! Please, stop!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"If you destroy the throne, your motherâ€™s recovery will only be temporary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Without the throne, the Lava Immortal Palace will fall to the beast tide, and the entire city will be slaughtered. You will be responsible for countless deaths!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"The weight of those sins will crush you, hindering your cultivation. You will be cursed with misfortune for life, despised by heaven and earth. You wonâ€™t be able to take a single step forward!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Youâ€™ve already felt the Karmic Fire burn your body! Imagine that pain multiplied by ten thousand. Can you handle it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit desperately tried to reason with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">It knew that if the Lava Immortal Palace fell and countless lives were lost, it too would share the blame!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I donâ€™t care! As long as my mother gains more spiritualityâ€¦" Ning Zhuoâ€™s face was cold and resolute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit screamed in frustration, flames bursting from its body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sun Lingtong rushed to Ning Zhuoâ€™s side, standing guard and watching the fire spirit warily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Zhu Xuanji was filled with rage, for the first time harboring a killing intent toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit pleaded, but Ning Zhuo remained unmoved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Ning Zhuo!" it roared like thunder, "Donâ€™t take this step! It will ruin your life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Causing the massacre of an entire city will make you a wanted criminal across the kingdom. The righteous cultivators will unite to hunt you down."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">It threw itself toward Ning Zhuo, even allowing the mechanical scythe to cleave into its left arm, nearly severing it, as it grabbed hold of the scythe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Meng Yaoyin's strength was clearly no match for Zhu Xuanjiâ€™s, and she struggled to break free.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Zhu Xuanji let out a long cry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Divine Abilityâ€”Golden Soldiers Retreat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Golden energy coated the mechanical scythe, freezing its surface in solid gold, sealing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Before the seal could fully take hold, Zhu Xuanji let go of the scythe, breaking free and lunging toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The underworld envoy Qi Bai, Rudi Butterfly Maiden, and the Ice Crystal Weather Sphere moved to intercept him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">But Zhu Xuanji feigned an attack and rushed toward the throne, grabbing a treasure mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Meng Yaoyin swiftly transformed the scythe back into a snake, sending it after Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The mirror he held was none other than the Golden Phoenix Mirror!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">This mirror, crafted by the Lava Immortal Palace, was perfect for controlling its mechanical creations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Meng Yaoyin, being a mechanical creation herself, was particularly vulnerable to the Golden Phoenix Mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Sure enough, when Zhu Xuanji directed the mirror at her, Meng Yaoyinâ€™s movements slowed, her actions becoming stiff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">But the mirror had no such effect on the Night Rain Demon Weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Where are Chi Dun and Zhou Nongying?!" Zhu Xuanji, entangled by the mechanical snake, was unable to stop Ning Zhuo and grew increasingly desperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit suddenly cried out, "Ning Zhuo, do you know what the Three Patriarchs said when they built the palace to guard Fire Persimmon Mountain?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"â€˜The Golden Furnaceâ€™s red flame refines souls, the Immortal Palaceâ€™s burial redeems the people.â€™"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"I urge the Southern Emperor to abandon his obsession, for old feelings are as fleeting as smoke."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"All beings are burdened by suffering and desire, yet they act as masters of their puppet bodies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"My Buddha preaches compassion, for only great love leads to the true path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"I understand now! Iâ€™ve figured it out!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Itâ€™s not just a message for the Southern Emperor of the past, itâ€™s meant for you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Let go, let go of your obsession!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"For fourteen years, hasnâ€™t this burden made your life miserable?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Let go! Just let go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"For fourteen years, the Lava Immortal Palace has been the greatest string pulling your life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Let go of your obsession, let go of your mental barriers. You must learn compassion, for compassion is great love!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
