<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Linghu Jiu liked Ning Zhuo's carefree attitude and became even more excited, taking out stone bowls, one for each of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He sat down hurriedly: "Here we go, here we go!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Seeing his behavior, Ning Zhuo silently reflected: When Ning Zhuo served tea last time, although Linghu Jiu was happy, he wasn't nearly as excited as he was now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo used the seal-breaking technique taught in Zhu Xuanji’s letter to successfully open the clay seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">At that moment, the wine's aroma filled the entire cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">As soon as Linghu Jiu smelled it, he blurted out: "Oh! It's a national treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">His eyes lit up, and his Adam's apple bobbed with excitement: "Wow, this is a hundred-year-old National Treasure National Longing Wine, quite rare indeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Brother, where did you get this? I've tried many times to acquire it through others. There are many spiritual wines on the market, but this hundred-year-old National Treasure is extremely hard to find.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Thanks to your good fortune, I truly have a treat today, haha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo smiled, pouring a full bowl for both Linghu Jiu and himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">They clinked their stone bowls and began drinking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">In the stone bowls, the National Longing Wine was crimson like jade, clear and bright, reflecting their expectant faces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Taking a gentle sip, the wine's aroma mixed with a faint scent of red beans, gentle yet distant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Upon entering the mouth, it was smooth and silky, warm like early spring dew. The subtle sweetness of red beans dissolved on the tongue, carrying traces of emotion, followed by a rich aftertaste with a hint of bitterness, like lingering lovesickness weighing heavily on one's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The two savored it slowly, neither speaking for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">After a long while, Linghu Jiu broke the silence: "Hundred-year National Treasure, truly lives up to its name! Gentle on entry, with the sweetness of red beans and the rich aroma of hundred years of brewing. The sentiment of lovesickness is endless, and the more you taste it, the more profound it feels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"A hundred years passed, yet still lovesick..." Ning Zhuo also sighed deeply, "The longer it ages, the deeper the longing - what an excellent wine, truly excellent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Recently, Ning Zhuo had tasted three kinds of wine: Ice Jade Wine, Netherworld Thought Brew, and National Longing Wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Of the first two, Ice Jade Wine could use spirit to boost qi, quickly elevating one's cultivation. Linghu Jiu had benefited greatly from this as well. As for the Netherworld Thought Brew, regardless of whether it was real or fake, it could connect yin and yang, often providing insights from ancient sages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">These two wines had powerful effects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">But National Longing Wine was different from the previous two - it seemed more luxurious, merely letting one experience the feeling of longing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">This wine was difficult to preserve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Because lovesickness is hard to maintain for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">How long can ordinary people remain lovesick? One year, two years, ten years, or twenty years?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Hearts change easily, feelings fade readily, and time's flow can wash away everything, eroding all things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">An emotion is difficult to maintain for several years or decades. As for a hundred years... that's even rarer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Because ordinary people's lives are but a fleeting hundred years. What kind of emotion could make someone yearn for an entire lifetime?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Once, the Supreme Emperor of the Southern Bean Kingdom wanted to express exactly this emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">It's said that the wine she personally designed and brewed still exists today.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">She wanted to give it to someone, but not a single jar of this fine wine was ever successfully delivered!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Making National Longing Wine is very difficult - it requires the spirit chef to harbor intense feelings of longing to even have a chance at creating it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Preserving National Longing Wine is also difficult. The lovesickness contained within needs to endure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Therefore, hundred-year-old National Longing Wine is rare in the market. Once it exceeds several decades, the wine itself spoils and becomes undrinkable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But today, Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu were drinking such wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">For a moment, both were immersed in feelings of longing, deeply affected and unable to break free.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo thought of his mother. Though she had been transformed into a mechanism accompanying him, seemingly close yet still distant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The second goal of embryonic breathing spiritual root was too distant and enormous - until now, Ning Zhuo hadn't found a feasible path to destroy this restriction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Linghu Jiu thought of his little junior sister Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The taste of National Longing Wine dissolved in his mouth, like countless threads gently wrapping around his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He had been adopted by Lin Bufan when very young, watching Lin Shanshan grow up bit by bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Those sweet but brief moments he spent with Lin Shanshan seemed to be stretched longer by time's sediment in this wine, appearing increasingly deep and lasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The National Longing Wine transformed every thought in Linghu Jiu's heart into drops within the wine, gradually spreading through his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Life is like wine, longing like a song," Linghu Jiu sighed. "Some longings eventually fade with time's passage, while others grow deeper with aging!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This drinking session had a very different atmosphere from their previous one. The last was passionate, this one was emotional.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">After several rounds, Ning Zhuo directly spoke about his situation: "Brother Linghu Jiu, I recently drank the Netherworld Contemplation Brew again, but received no guidance from ancestors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Linghu Jiu pointed at Ning Zhuo: "This situation is absolutely normal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"You must know, drinking this wine only provides us an opportunity - a chance to communicate with ancestral sages in the netherworld."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Only when the netherworld ancestors are willing, have free time, and find us agreeable will they provide some guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Most times when I drink Netherworld Contemplation Brew, nothing happens. Even when something does occur, it's usually fragmentary mumblings, hard to understand. I can only rely on my own talent to gain insights and benefits from these mumblings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Your last burst of good fortune wasn't the norm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "I see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He looked deeply at Linghu Jiu, staying silent for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Seeing his strange expression and intense stare, Linghu Jiu laughed casually: "Brother, if you have something to say, just say it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo hadn't used the Life Hanging by a Thread, so he couldn't use the Buddha's Heart Demon Seal to sense Linghu Jiu's inner thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">But based on his dozen years of life experience and ability to gauge human nature, he was certain of Linghu Jiu's sincerity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">A gleam flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he boldly spoke directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He first mentioned how he had asked the Ning family's Golden Core Elder to seek the wine recipe, but Lin Bufan had strictly refused without any room for discussion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He then told how he had given the wine to a spirit chef to taste and identify the recipe, but received unexpected feedback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Linghu Jiu found this very intriguing: "You say the Netherworld Contemplation Brew is fake... that it actually has no function of communicating with netherworld ancestors?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Impossible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Linghu Jiu shook his head firmly: "This is the wine Master personally gave me, and strictly ordered me to... keep it secret."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At this point, Linghu Jiu became somewhat uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">His nature was casual and unrestrained - to put it bluntly, when he got emotional, he often forgot about such instructions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Netherworld Contemplation Brew was the perfect example.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Although his master had required him to strictly keep it secret, Linghu Jiu felt that since the wine was mostly ineffective even for talented people like himself, it wasn't very valuable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Therefore, when he took a liking to Ning Zhuo last time, he directly brought it out for Ning Zhuo to drink freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Seeing Linghu Jiu's extreme trust in Lin Bufan, Ning Zhuo said: "Last time I heard brother mention that Lin Bufan personally went to great lengths for your sake, specifically finding a chef to design this wine recipe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I dare to make a disrespectful guess: perhaps Lin Bufan was also deceived? After all, he's not a spirit chef - being able to dabble in spirit plants, healing, and pill refining within the hundred cultivation arts is already mastering heaven and earth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Different trades are like mountains apart, each profession has its specialties, so being deceived isn't impossible, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Linghu Jiu nodded: "Indeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He then cupped his hands: "Thank you for telling me this, I will find a day to report to Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">But Ning Zhuo raised his hand: "Brother Ling Hu, I have some interesting intelligence to tell you. It's related to the Five Elements Divine Lord..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After listening, Linghu Jiu fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He raised his head, staring at Ning Zhuo: "I understand your meaning - you're saying there's something wrong here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">He pointed at this cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Exactly." Ning Zhuo clapped and smiled, "The ancient Ten Thousand Demons Mountain, today's Ten Thousand Demons Cave. The Five Elements Divine Lord fell here. Maybe he left something behind? Perhaps that’s how he can still influence the outside world today."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Last time, after I returned and the wine's effect had worn off, I still received his guidance under the Spirit Concealment Willow, receiving a terrifying boost in my Five Elements realm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Whether from the perspective of yin longevity or the Netherworld Contemplation Brew, this isn't normal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Linghu Jiu laughed heartily, standing up: "Interesting, interesting!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"I was confined here by my Master for punishment, and this is where I spend most of my time. Originally I thought that this place was ordinary, but after what you've said, I feel likethere's something mysterious about it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Why don't we take advantage of our wine-induced high spirits to explore the Ten Thousand Demons Cave together? After all, I was punished to guard this place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo was overjoyed: "That's exactly what I wanted but dared not ask! Brother, please lead the way!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The two walked side by side, deep into the Ten Thousand Demons Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The cave was pitch black, with wet and slippery stone steps underfoot. The sound of water droplets hitting rock walls echoed around, as if the cave itself was alive, silently telling secrets of the ages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Both Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu used hand seals to emit light, illuminating their surroundings and the path ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Descending the steps, the air grew heavier. The two communicated through sound transmission, with only their footsteps echoing in the quiet cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">After walking for a while, man-made traces like stone steps disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The darkness grew deeper, and even the light maintained by their spiritual power was noticeably compressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The cave path began to become steep, with some places so narrow they had to walk single file, sideways, to barely squeeze through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo could clearly feel himself constantly descending underground along a sloping direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He began to faintly hear water sounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Not the dripping of water seeping through cave walls that they'd heard along the way, but the sound of flowing river water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Linghu Jiu was quite familiar with the path, warning Ning Zhuo whenever dead ends appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Sometimes when I'm confined here, I get extremely bored and explore underground alone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Don't laugh, but I often hoped some demon beasts would appear for me to kill. Either to relieve boredom or establish merit so Master would lift my confinement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"But I always returned empty-handed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"The Ten Thousand Demons Cave used to have demon beasts, even beast tides. But for the past hundred years, all has been peaceful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"The biggest disturbance was when your Ning family suddenly came to our Ten Thousand Medicines Valley following the underground pupil river."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Linghu Jiu transmitted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo smiled and responded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The two chatted while walking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Turning a corner, Ning Zhuo's view suddenly opened up - they had entered an enormous underground dissolution cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The cave's dome hung high like a sky canopy, dotted with countless glowing stones shining like stars, illuminating the entire cave like a dream. Crystal formations hung from the cave walls like dripping icicles, flowing with faint light in their stillness and motion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but stop to admire this beautiful sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Linghu Jiu had seen it many times and found nothing new, but tactfully stopped to give Ning Zhuo time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Past here, there will gradually be signs of life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, we'll reach the dark river's edge. Can you imagine a great river flowing endlessly deep underground?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Haha, that's quite a sight too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Linghu Jiu wasn't too concerned about verifying Ning Zhuo's wild imagination. He was thinking that showing Ning Zhuo around wouldn't be a waste of effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">But in the next moment, Ning Zhuo's expression suddenly changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Because Ning Zhuo seemed to hear a voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">That voice was extremely familiar to him! It was the Five Elements Divine Lord's voice: "Boy,  you came down specially to see me?" Haha, look at that stalactite, study it carefully! That is the gateway."</paragraph><br/><br/>
