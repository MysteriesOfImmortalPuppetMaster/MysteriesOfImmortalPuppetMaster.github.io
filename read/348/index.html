<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon grunted, its fierce attacks weakening considerably after being hit by Night Shadow Mountain's onslaught.<br/>
Meng Zizhong wanted to counterattack, but after trying various methods, all failed.<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon's close combat skills were profound, clearly surpassing Meng Zizhong in martial arts.<br/>
Meng Zizhong's Golden Core remained dim and hadn't recovered even during close combat.<br/>
<br/>
After some thought, Meng Zizhong could only deliver a heavy blow, temporarily forcing back the Black Wind Tiger Demon, before quickly changing direction and leaping into the formation of cultivator troops.<br/>
<br/>
Military Strategy - Troops Value Speed!<br/>
Military Strategy - Head and Tail Respond to Each Other!<br/>
<br/>
With these two military strategies applied, the speed of the cultivator troops immediately surged, and their coordination improved more than fivefold compared to before.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivator troops had already formed a dynamic formation, and now with their speed and coordination drastically increased, the power of the dynamic formation also increased seven to eight times.<br/>
<br/>
What was previously one battle formation suddenly became equivalent to at least seven combined formations.<br/>
The battle formation flowed like a flood across the land, quickly surrounding the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong acted as the formation's core commander. This time, full of vigor and spirit greatly lifted, he actively engaged the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
<br/>
The two once again engaged in fierce combat, but the situation was completely reversed. Now Meng Zizhong firmly held the upper hand, his strength, offense, and defense all far surpassing the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
<br/>
At a disadvantage, the Black Wind Tiger Demon suffered several wounds in a short time. Fortunately, its flesh-and-blood devouring technique, combined with its demonic beast physique, gave it strong recovery abilities, preventing it from being defeated.<br/>
<br/>
However, while it could maintain its position, the other demon cultivators were not so fortunate.<br/>
The human cultivators launched a small counterattack, quickly slaughtering the demon cultivators.<br/>
"Run! Run for your lives!"<br/>
<br/>
"We can't hold them off! Everyone, take care of yourselves!"<br/>
<br/>
The demon cultivators wailed and shouted, turning tail and fleeing.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon had no military strategies to rely on, and normally didn't train or discipline the demon cultivators. Although those demon cultivators were generally stronger individually, they were essentially still a disorganized mob fighting separately.<br/>
<br/>
They could somewhat manage when things were going well, but once the tide turned, as it had now, their true nature as a motley crew was immediately exposed.<br/>
<br/>
As the demon cultivators scattered, the human cultivators gave chase. Under Meng Zizhong's orders, they surrounded the Black Wind Tiger Demon like millstones, grinding away at it relentlessly.<br/>
<br/>
The pressure on the Black Wind Tiger Demon increased several fold!<br/>
<br/>
It roared as it fought desperately, bathed in blood.<br/>
<br/>
The exchanges at the Golden Core level were not something that ordinary cultivators could withstand. Many were caught in the crossfire and died miserably in the formation.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Black Wind Tiger snorted coldly and said with displeasure: "That damned Meng Zizhong, deliberately preserving Meng family's core members and only consuming our demon cultivators, preparing to replenish his garrison troops in the future."<br/>
<br/>
On the mountainside of Cloud Concealment Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and the others didn't have Black Wind Tiger's keen eyesight to see through Meng Zizhong's Mountain's grand strategy.<br/>
Ning Zhuo secretly sighed in admiration.<br/>
<br/>
Leading troops was one of the hundred arts of cultivation, corresponding to holding official positions.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Dan had learned about the existence of military strategies from classics and books, and knew some classic strategies. Witnessing it firsthand today, comparing it with the knowledge in his mind, he gained even more insights.<br/>
<br/>
"Black Wind Tiger Demon, you've been a scourge for years. Today, Meng Zizhong' will eliminate you for the people and the country!" Meng Zizhong's imposing aura was overwhelming, his voice like spring thunder, suppressing the Black Wind Tiger Demon so it couldn't raise its head.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong used his talent to observe the battle. Now that the Black Wind Tiger Demon was extremely weak, he finally saw through its condition: "That white tiger is done for, its internal power is almost exhausted and can't sustain it anymore."<br/>
<br/>
"You should make your move now!" Ning Zhuotong reminded.<br/>
Fox God was slightly startled.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Dan nodded slightly, smiling as he looked at Fox God: "Fox God, heed my command. Quickly use your methods to assist this Black Wind Tiger Demon back to the mountain."<br/>
<br/>
Fox God was shocked, his face paling a bit: "You want me to help the Black Wind Tiger Demon?"<br/>
Sun Lingtong snorted coldly: "The Black Wind Tiger Demon is your prey, and so is Meng Zizhong."<br/>
Hearing this, Fox God's heart wavered, his lips slightly parted, his face filled with determination.<br/>
<br/>
If she were to act, he would inevitably offend Meng Zizhong slightly. The Fox God wasn't too concerned about Meng Zizhong alone, but the key was the Meng family.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s gaze was icy: "Fox God, you've received the imperial edict, do you still want to play both sides? Don't make a mistake!"<br/>
A chill ran through Fox God's heart as he realized she had already been drawn into the political struggle between the Zhu family and the Meng family.<br/>
<br/>
Even as a Golden Core level existence on Mist Concealment Mountain, she didn't dare to get involved in such a power struggle. With a bit of bad luck, she would become a sacrificial pawn, crushed to pieces in the confrontation and grinding between the two major forces.<br/>
<br/>
But as Ning Zhuo said, did he have any other choice?<br/>
<br/>
No!<br/>
<br/>
If he didn't act now, she feared she would meet her demise before the Black Wind Tiger Demon, that was for certain.<br/>
<br/>
Talent - Cloud and Mist Shroud.<br/>
<br/>
Fox God gritted his teeth, her face gloomy, and finally made her move.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, mist rose from the mountain, enveloping the entire Mist Concealment Mountain, then quickly spreading outward to cover the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The rolling mist swept up the Black Wind Tiger Demon, pulling it away from the battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong hadn't expected anyone to intervene, but the Black Wind Tiger Demon exerted all its strength, tightly entangling him, preventing him from pursuing.<br/>
<br/>
The other Foundation Establishment cultivators, though no longer empowered by the battle formation, lacked the means to resist the sweeping mist.<br/>
<br/>
Fox God easily retreated.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon was saved and dove into Mist Concealment Mountain, shouting as it went: "Fox God, many thanks for saving me. I'll surely repay this life-saving favor!"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong was still controlling the battle formation and blew away the mist around him. Looking at the cloud-shrouded Mist Concealment Mountain, he angrily shouted: "Fox God, you disgrace your title as a righteous god of the Southern Kingdom, actually assisting a demon!"<br/>
<br/>
Fox God snorted coldly, no longer caring about appearances. Without waiting for Jin Dan's order, she used the mountain mist to sweep up many human cultivators and send them into Mist Concealment Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
"General, save us!"<br/>
<br/>
The human cultivators fell into chaos. Separated from the battle formation, their strength reverted to normal, and many were killed by the fleeing demon cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Many others were caught in bitter battles, and without help, would surely lose their lives.<br/>
Meng Zizhong had originally thought of withdrawing when he saw the mountain god intervene to rescue the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
But now, faced with this situation, he had no choice but to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
If he really abandoned his subordinates and left alone, he would surely be seen as deserting in the face of the enemy. Not only would his reputation be ruined, but he would also face severe punishment from the officials. He definitely couldn't keep his position as the city lord.<br/>
<br/>
This would undoubtedly greatly damage the Meng family's interests in this area.<br/>
<br/>
And as for Meng Zizhong’s personal feelings, he was unwilling to abandon his subordinates, especially the many core members of the Meng family. He had trained these troops diligently, spending countless days together, investing much time and effort, and had developed deep feelings for them.<br/>
<br/>
There's a saying that one shouldn't pursue a fleeing enemy to the bitter end, and Meng Zizhong naturally knew this principle.<br/>
But he had no choice. He could only grab his long-handled war hammer and charge into Mist Concealment Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
To his surprise, he wasn't intercepted by Fox God when he entered the mountain, but smoothly chased to the western valley of the mountain, once again catching up to the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon had gained a chance to catch its breath and had recovered some of its battle power.<br/>
It engaged Meng Zizhong once again.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong no longer had the assistance of the battle formation and wasn't as dominant as before. But the Black Wind Tiger Demon was also quite weak, and the two fought to a standstill.<br/>
<br/>
As the feeling of exhaustion grew stronger, the Black Wind Tiger Demon finally brought out its ultimate trump card.<br/>
It threw out a divine seal, which hovered above its head.<br/>
Empowered by the divine seal, the Black Wind Tiger Demon's battle power surged, forcing Meng Zizhong to retreat step by step.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier on the battlefield outside the mountain, this divine seal had no effect. Now, with the Black Wind Tiger Demon inside Mist Concealment Mountain, it could draw on part of the seal's power through its blood lineage connection, completely gaining the upper hand.<br/>
<br/>
"I've lost!" Meng Zizhong realized the situation was irretrievable and could only drag his war hammer as he fled deeper into the mountain.<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon pursued relentlessly, catching up to Meng Zizhong and severely wounding him.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong fell to the ground but didn't panic. The distance was now sufficient, so he decisively ignited a teleportation talisman, quickly transporting himself deeper into the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon didn't dare to chase deeper into the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The divine seal wouldn't work deeper in the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Just as it was about to turn back to vent its anger by slaughtering the human cultivators trapped in the mountain, Zhu Xuanji descended from the sky.<br/>
This divine constable of the Southern Bean Kingdom pressed down with one finger, directly crushing the Black Wind Tiger Demon's skull.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon tried its best to resist, but the divine seal was ineffective, and it was extremely weak and depleted, completely unable to withstand Zhu Xuanji's immense strength.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon's head was crushed.<br/>
<br/>
The headless corpse swayed a few times before finally falling to the ground, motionless.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong, who was about to flee, saw this scene and immediately showed a look of joy.<br/>
He recognized Zhu Xuanji and called out loudly: "Divine Constable Zhu!"<br/>
<br/>
However, Zhu Xuanji didn't give him a friendly look, his gaze filled with scrutiny: "Meng Zizhong, you led troops out on your own authority, fought incompetently, caused heavy casualties among Meng Zizhong garrison, and even fled after being defeated yourself, showing no dignity as a military commander of the Southern Bean Kingdom!"<br/>
<br/>
"Do you admit your guilt?"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong's face turned very ugly. His mouth opened wide, his Adam's apple bobbing as he wanted to say something, but in the end, he only lowered his head and replied in a low voice: "This lowly official admits his guilt."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked at Fox God: "Why aren't you going yet?"<br/>
<br/>
Fox God transformed into mountain mist, disappearing from his original spot, and in the next moment, appeared before Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
She bowed deeply, taking the initiative to admit her fault.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's expression was severe as he reprimanded Fox God for his transgressions, giving her a harsh dressing down before finally letting her off.<br/>
Next, Fox God personally took action, gathering up the remaining human cultivators from the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji escorted Meng Zizhong, leading the remnants of the garrison troops back to Yu Gang Mountain to take charge of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong's offense of nurturing enemies was too severe and could easily trigger a full-scale confrontation between the Zhu family and the Meng family. But Meng Zizhong's defeat and fleeing this time was enough of an offense to disqualify him from continuing to serve as the guardian of Yu Gang Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong met privately, participating in the final division of spoils according to their previous agreement.<br/>
Because he had been responsible for negotiating with Fox God earlier and had already gained some benefits, he only took a small share in the final division of the spoils.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Ning Zhuo obtained many remnant parts from demon cultivators, including a set of tiger bones from the Black Wind Tiger Demon, which were at the Golden Core level.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from this, there was also a share of Yu Gang Mountain's output.<br/>
<br/>
He sent a letter through royal channels back to Ning Jiufan of the Ning family, explaining the situation and temporarily arranging for Ning Houfan to serve as a representative stationed at Yu Gang Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Although this old man from the Ning family was quite old in years, he was experienced and steady, making him a suitable candidate for deployment.<br/>
With this, the struggle surrounding Mist Concealment Mountain finally came to an end.<br/>
<br/>
The seven, including Sun and Ning, boarded the Ten Thousand Mile Roaming Dragon to continue their journey.<br/>
<br/>
In the dragon's head cabin, Sun Lingtong felt more and more pleased the more he thought about it. Looking at Ning Zhuo with bright eyes, he said: "The righteous path is actually quite fun to play!"<br/>
<br/>
"Your gains were the smallest, but you put in the most effort. A few more bad things like this wouldn't be too few!"<br/>
