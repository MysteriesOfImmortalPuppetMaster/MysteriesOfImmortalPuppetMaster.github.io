<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo turned back and offered a gentle smile, raising his hand in greeting. "Lord Zhu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zhu Xuanji laughed heartily. "I must congratulate you, Ning Zhuo. Your reputation has soared after the Two Note Kingdom's battle at Thousand Peaks Forest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"From your provocative prophecy at the start of the war, the invasion at Thousand Peaks Forest, repelling the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, to the recent major battle where you defeated countless foes and captured numerous enemies, your achievements are truly outstanding. Not to mention, you killed the Nascent Soul cultivator, the "Demon-Heart Cave Lord", and even angrily slapped Xiang Yue with a great blow.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"After this martial campaign, your fame will spread throughout the regions surrounding Two Note Kingdom. Your Ning family will also gain considerable attention due to your deeds."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"This time, you enlisted using your true name and identity. The fame you've garnered will surely benefit your family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo lightly furrowed his brows. "I appreciate your reminder, Lord Zhu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"However, I am merely at Foundation Establishment level. Given the recent events involving Xiang Yue and offending Du Tiechuan, rewards may be difficult to attain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Indeed, I've attracted much attention. For my future travels, I'll need to lay low for a while."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zhu Xuanji chuckled again, immediately recognizing Ning Zhuo's veiled caution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He stepped closer and warmly patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder. "Relax. Even if you've angered Du Tiechuan, your connection as the son-in-law of General Mu guarantees your achievements won't be ignored."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"You've aided me greatly, indirectly rescuing Xiang Yue. Rest assured, I will ensure you're rewarded appropriately, settling this karma completely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Now, you may leave Thousand Peaks Forest and continue your journey."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo regarded Zhu Xuanji cautiously. "Lord Zhu, are you worried about me plotting against the Six Caves Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhu Xuanji inwardly sighed, impressed by Ning Zhuo’s sharp insight. He spoke frankly, "Correct. Lu Hongtu from Six Caves Sect has longstanding secret ties with our Southern Bean Kingdom. However, he's cunning, always treating our alliance as a mere backup plan, never truly pledging loyalty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Though he is ambitious and cunning, the Six Caves Sect remains valuable to our Southern Bean Kingdom. Given your grudge against him, restraint is necessary for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo immediately frowned deeply, shaking his head resolutely. "How can I restrain from avenging a family grudge? Lord Zhu mustn't force my hand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Previously, upon leaving Southern Bean Kingdom, Ning Zhuo had received Zhu Xuanji's care. Zhu Xuanji had hinted at their involvement in Thousand Peaks Forest, but Ning Zhuo had deliberately avoided detailed inquiries, reserving flexibility - if Six Cave Sect was indeed Southern Bean’s pawn, asking too many questions would tie his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After obtaining relevant intelligence, Ning Zhuo easily deduced Lu Hongtu's likely connections with the Southern Bean Kingdom. This wasn't difficult; after all, Six Cave Sect openly interacted with external factions under Lu Hongtu's leadership while internally operating under dark, demonic methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">If Six Caves Sect could establish ties with the Ning family of the Northern Wind Kingdom, how could they lack relations with the Southern Bean Kingdom?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Although Ning Zhuo shared close ties with Zhu Xuanji, and despite the Ning family's alliance with the Zhu royal family, their interests didn't always align perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">At least in this matter, Ning Zhuo and his family leaned toward vengeance, while the Zhu family saw value in preserving Lu Hongtu and the Six Caves Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After the battle, with Two Note Kingdom withdrawing, Lu Hongtu and Six Caves Sect's influence in Thousand Peaks Forest would inevitably surge, becoming leaders among the human cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This granted Lu Hongtu immense strategic value, prompting the Southern Bean Kingdom to pursue him more vigorously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo decisively rejected Zhu Xuanji's plea, expressing his position firmly. Just as he prepared to seriously dispute this with Zhu Xuanji, the latter suddenly tilted his head back and laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Puzzled, Ning Zhuo asked, "Lord Zhu, why are you laughing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Stopping his laughter, Zhu Xuanji pointed at Ning Zhuo with a smile. "Ning Zhuo, you've truly changed - impressively so."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo paused slightly in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Zhu Xuanji turned away, standing next to Ning Zhuo, gazing into the sunset beyond the mountains. "I still vividly remember you back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Back then, you were patient yet humble, bitter yet stubborn. Deep inside, you held resentment toward fate, filled with hidden determination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"The person you were then would never have openly defied me like today."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Yet how long has it truly been?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Indeed, as the old saying goes - maturity doesn't come from age, but from experience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Without hardships, one cannot truly grow. You've endured fire and blood, and now you've truly grown."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Listening carefully to the poem you just recited- </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"In a hundred battles, why fear becoming smoke?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Unchanged through countless calamities, my spirit vast as the horizon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">A true man's blood should soak the battlefield,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sword in hand, drunk with glory beneath the blazing sun!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Your poetry brims with an undeniable yearning for war, an ambition that fears no sacrifice! This truly excites me about your future, Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo hadn't expected such praise from Zhu Xuanji, and he couldn't help but feel pleased again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Nearby, Sun Lingtong from within the Mechanical Dragon overheard this praise and smiled broadly with pride. Hearing others praise Ning Zhuo filled him with even greater joy than if they had praised himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Having practically raised Ning Zhuo himself, Sun Lingtong felt a deep, genuine sense of achievement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"I never imagined Elder Zhu would change this much," Sun Lingtong laughed heartily, "he has truly become eloquent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Since he's so pleasant, he should speak more often!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sun Lingtong wholeheartedly agreed with Zhu Xuanji's appreciation, exclaiming, "Indeed, Little Zhuo and I have always been together, yet somehow, I didn't notice these transformations. It took Elder Zhu's words to open my eyes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"He’s far more dazzling than before! His eyes are sharp, brimming with spirit, and his fighting intent soaring - such a formidable presence is truly rare, even within Fire Persimmon Immortal City!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Receiving such praise, Ning Zhuo’s gaze initially sharpened with pride, but soon softened back into calm humility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Many thanks, Elder Zhu," he responded respectfully. "I’ve just stepped off the battlefield, still overflowing with fighting spirit. Throughout the Eastern Campaign, I achieved my initial objectives, cut down many foes, and gained significant rewards - indeed, my heart is brimming with satisfaction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Yet, reflecting now, I relied heavily on luck. Killing Lord Demonheart depended almost entirely on my comrades' assistance. Moreover, without Sect Master Lin Bufan and Elder Zhu’s secret support, I wouldn't have accomplished such feats."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Truthfully, I'm merely at Foundation Establishment. Although battlefield strategy boosted my strength temporarily to match a Golden Core cultivator, these methods are only viable during large-scale battles and ineffective for individual combat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"As my reputation spreads, my weaknesses will inevitably become public knowledge, inviting targeted challenges. Once the army disbands after withdrawing from the Two Note Kingdom, I'll lose access to their national power, making it nearly impossible to gather significant military strength quickly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Building an army wasn't as simple as casually deploying mechanical puppets, something Ning Zhuo had done effortlessly by leveraging Two Note Kingdom's resources. Starting from scratch was prohibitively expensive and demanding. Given Ning Zhuo's wandering lifestyle, he wasn't currently considering such an ambitious undertaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He turned to Zhu Xuanji, asking tentatively, "Could you perhaps offer me a temporary military position, Elder Zhu?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhu Xuanji’s expression instantly grew stern, shaking his head slowly, "Military roles aren't casual gifts, Ning Zhuo. You've rendered no official service to our nation. If I offered you a role privately, how could I justify it under our laws? Being a member of the royal family, showing favoritism would severely undermine discipline."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo smiled lightly, understanding the rejection entirely within his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Inwardly, Zhu Xuanji sighed with relief, thinking, "That was close - I almost agreed on impulse."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Having witnessed Ning Zhuo's astonishing prowess firsthand, Zhu Xuanji was undeniably impressed. Ning Zhuo was indeed a rare talent, and his initial instinct was to welcome him eagerly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">However, recalling Ning Zhuo’s identity as the Child of Calamity sent shivers down Zhu Xuanji’s spine. Allowing Ning Zhuo to roam freely under the banner of Southern Bean Kingdom would only invite disaster. Zhu Xuanji vividly remembered the turmoil Ning Zhuo brought wherever he went - Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Misty Hidden Mountain, Myriad Medicines Sect, Thousand Peaks Forest - each place had faced upheaval and chaos due to Ning Zhuo’s very presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Wherever this fellow goes, calamity follows! His actions tie causes and effects everywhere! Associating him closely with our nation would surely invite disaster!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Suppressing a cold sweat, Zhu Xuanji refocused as Ning Zhuo queried, "Elder Zhu, earlier you mentioned crucial intelligence about my mother. Could you elaborate?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zhu Xuanji withdrew a sealed letter, handing it solemnly to Ning Zhuo. Quickly scanning it with his divine sense, Ning Zhuo’s expression dramatically shifted. Shocked, he murmured, "What? The true identity of Misty Hidden Mountain's Mountain Deity is actually the Cloud Fox my mother cultivated?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zhu Xuanji nodded seriously. "I stumbled upon this by chance as well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“This Cloud Beast was nurtured by your mother on her way to the Ning Family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Upon reaching Mist Concealment Mountain, your mother arranged for it to become one of the mountain gods.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo blinked rapidly, comprehension dawning upon him. "I see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"No wonder Fox God gifted me something as precious as the Spirit Concealment Willow directly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"To tell the truth, I had my doubts earlier."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Indeed, Ning Zhuo’s confusion mirrored that of Zhu Xuanji and Shen Ling. Those two had initially suspected Ning Zhuo possessed the Life Hanging Thread, controlling the Fox God to submit. Yet, after investigation, they discovered the Fox God already shared a deep history with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The Fox God received my mother’s nurturing, hence rewarding me with the Spirit Concealment Willow - perhaps intending to repay her kindness and settle past karma."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"If so, even gods have their spiritual debts to settle," Ning Zhuo mused thoughtfully, his eyes narrowing slightly as he nudged his chin in contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Observing Ning Zhuo’s expression, Zhu Xuanji gently reminded him, "Do not forget, the Fox God has already been officially appointed by the royal family as a true Mountain God of Mist Concealment Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo murmured softly, “Troublesome,” yet outwardly cupped his hands politely, "Naturally, I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Zhu Xuanji patted Ning Zhuo’s shoulder reassuringly. "If you seek your mother’s old belongings, you can head to Flying Cloud Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"According to the Fox God's revelation, your mother came from the Flying Cloud Kingdom; undoubtedly, you'll find more clues there."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo hesitated, frowning slightly. "The Cloud Kingdom is vast. I'm a stranger there; seeking clues about my mother would be like finding a needle in the ocean."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Zhu Xuanji produced a token, handing it to Ning Zhuo. "I've already arranged everything for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"This is a token for the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer. Find her and use this token to request her divination; she will undoubtedly provide crucial clues."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo carefully took the token, discovering it was a white jade candle. The candle radiated an indescribably eerie chill - not sharp as ice but enough to make Ning Zhuo’s hair stand on end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He stored the token carefully, glancing back at Zhu Xuanji. "Please forgive my ignorance, but who exactly is the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zhu Xuanji explained patiently, "It's understandable you don’t know her. She isn't alive, but rather a ghost cultivator famed in the Underworld."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"She is known as the Green Candle Cutter. With this token, head to White Paper City of Black Water Mountain, and you'll sense her presence, gaining an audience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo solemnly nodded, cupping his fists respectfully. "Many thanks, Lord Zhu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Then, Ning Zhuo gazed expectantly at Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">With a hearty laugh, Zhu Xuanji retrieved two treasured boxes. "I know you tasked Lin Bufan to find the Ten-Thousand-Year Water Essence and, if possible, the Ten-Thousand-Year Wood Essence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"These are collected treasures from the Southern Bean Kingdom, precisely what you sought, offered as repayment for your assistance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Overjoyed, Ning Zhuo accepted them immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Zhu Xuanji continued, "I'll inform Lin Bufan; there's no further need for him to act."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Leave quickly now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Remember, lingering here is pointless - the Heaven and Earth Ghost Twins are still around."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo nodded decisively. "My gratitude for your care, Lord Zhu."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"However, there are still unresolved matters in the Two Note Kingdom, like my misunderstanding with Du Tiechuan and my engagement with Mu Lan. Can the Southern Bean Kingdom assist in mediating these?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Zhu Xuanji shook his head, "Your relationship with Mu Lan is a personal affair; I shouldn't interfere."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"As for Du Tiechuan, don't worry too much. He might not resent you as deeply as you think."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Confused by Zhu Xuanji's reassurance, Ning Zhuo asked, "Why is that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Zhu Xuanji smiled mysteriously. "Do you really wish to know?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Realizing he was brushing against national secrets, Ning Zhuo quickly withdrew, shaking his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zhu Xuanji waved dismissively. "Go on, now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">With a respectful bow, Ning Zhuo swiftly activated his waist sash, diving into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, promptly leaving the area without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Watching Ning Zhuo vanish, Zhu Xuanji released a long breath, relieved. "That walking disaster is finally gone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"This time he's heading far off to Flying Cloud Kingdom - surely, his problems won’t implicate me again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Meanwhile, the Two Note Kingdom’s army traversed quietly through the mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Du Tiechuan sat alone in his war chariot. Despite his outwardly solemn demeanor, he enjoyed wine leisurely, revealing an oddly content expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Setting down his cup, he began drafting a memorial, fully accepting responsibility for the recent military failure and withdrawal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Finishing it, he placed it aside, looking towards the distant capital of the Two Note Kingdom, a chilling smile slowly spreading across his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Clearly, the hidden political intrigue surrounding the war against the Thousand Peaks Forest was far more intricate and dangerous than Ning Zhuo had imagined.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
