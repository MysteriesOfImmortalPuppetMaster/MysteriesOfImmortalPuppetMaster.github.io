<paragraph index="1">“Master? Master!” Liu Er cried out in alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He watched with his eyes wide open as the old demon cultivator transformed into a swirl of complicated, colorful smoke and vanished on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Instinctively, Liu Er reached out to grab him, but caught nothing but air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Liu Er hurriedly activated various incantations to search all around, yet found no trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Could Master have died?” Liu Er’s heart turned cold. For a moment, he remained rooted to the spot, at a loss for what to do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Before long, he shook his head and muttered to himself, “No, that can’t be it. Master’s methods are so miraculous; how could he possibly fall just from giving me a bit of guidance this once?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“But Master must have paid a tremendous price this time. That’s for sure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Sigh! He sacrificed so much. I must see my ambition through to repay him!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After consoling himself like this, Liu Er finally left this patch of woodland, albeit hesitantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Moments later, thread after thread of smoke appeared out of thin air and converged again at the same spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">At first, these wisps of smoke were gray-white, giving off a sense of age and frailty. But as the smoke gathered in greater and greater quantity, spots of color began to emerge within the pale smoke, as if it were infused with life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Before long, the colors became rich and diverse. Suddenly, they compressed and condensed, transforming once again into the old demon cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The old man’s face and exposed skin were covered in a mix of colors, all kinds of bright hues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After a few breaths, those brilliant colors quickly faded and withdrew, until his skin appeared no different from an ordinary person’s.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The demon cultivator’s body shuddered; abruptly, he opened his eyes, like a drowning man saved from the water who could finally breathe again, or as though he had broken free from a nightmarish terror and returned to the real world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Huff, huff, huff...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">His expression suddenly came to life, filled with shock and alarm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“How is that possible?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“All I did was give the lad a slight bit of guidance. How could I suffer such a terrifying backlash that triggered my life-preserving art—Smoke and Haze Escape?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“This makes no sense!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The look of dread froze on the old demon cultivator’s face for a good quarter of an hour before it slowly faded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He frowned in deep thought. “This is troublesome.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Facing someone of strange fate and destiny, using divination carries a weight that is difficult to bear.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“I only accounted for Liu Er when I calculated the price of giving him guidance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“But evidently, that guidance had broader implications and interfered with someone else of formidable power. That’s why I ran into such misfortune.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">With that in mind, the old demon cultivator’s expression grew heavier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">His first suspicion was Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“My guidance of Liu Er puts Ning Zhuo at the greatest disadvantage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Could the backlash I suffered —nearly fatal —be because of him?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Hiss...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“So Liu Er’s failure might not be primarily because of the Two Note Nation and Mu Lan’s fate, but rather because of Ning Zhuo?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">At this thought, the old demon cultivator could no longer sit still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He promptly stood, swallowed a spiritual pearl, then split open his forehead, revealing a bloody eyeball, using it to observe the fortune of the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He saw a three-eared monkey sitting calmly, eyes closed, breathing evenly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Staring at the image of the monkey, the old demon cultivator’s bloody eye at his brow glinted with mystical radiance, growing ever brighter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">His own flesh shriveled at a speed visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">In his unique field of vision, the three-eared monkey gradually enlarged, becoming more and more distinct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He perceived greater secrets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The monkey’s belly was slightly rounded, suggesting that the Three Generals Camp itself was not short of military supplies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">With every breath the three-eared monkey took, its belly sank a bit, while its overall physique swelled slightly—this represented how the Three Generals Camp was growing stronger with every passing moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">All of these were positive, upright signs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">But the old demon cultivator was not satisfied with this; he wanted to see even more of the fundamental essence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He let out a low shout, inhaled sharply, and his entire body inflated into a small giant, seated on the ground, flattening nearby mountains and vegetation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The old man shut his eyes tight, pouring out all his magical power, spiritual sense, and life essence to fuel the crimson spiritual pearl at his brow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">That eyeball-like orb seemed to convulse: at times, it stared straight ahead, other times it glanced sideways or spun in circles. Sometimes its pupil scattered into countless black dots, which twisted into smoky clouds, then suddenly gathered again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">In the old demon cultivator’s vision, the three-eared monkey magnified further, and its surface layer turned transparent, revealing deeper layers within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Inside the monkey’s body lay a very simple structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">There was a heart that was a dull yellow, shaped like a monkey’s head, with a sharp face and hairy cheeks. It wore a sullen expression and, from time to time, when the heart beat, it gave a monkey’s cry filled with anxiety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The old demon cultivator instantly understood: “That’s Liu Er’s fortune.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Then he turned to look at the lungs nearby. The lungs were blood-red, filled with veins of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Each of those veins stood rigidly straight, without any smooth curvature at their bends.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">And with each breath of the monkey, the blood-lungs pulsed in rhythm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Most of these pulses were stable, but some were disordered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Whenever one of those disordered beats occurred, the blood-lungs would spasm, and the rigid veins would emit an eerie purple glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“This is Guan Hong’s fortune.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Guan Hong practices blood-based demonic arts and is proud and upright by nature. His right arm is wounded and has not healed. That’s a hidden danger.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Inside the monkey’s body, there was also a kidney.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The kidney was plump and round, entirely pitch-black. The black color churned like a tide, rising and falling repeatedly with booming resonance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Zhang Hei practices water-based arts. He’s tough by nature and has considerable family resources; indeed, this kidney imagery suits him perfectly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“How strange!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Where is Ning Zhuo’s fortune?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Within the monkey’s body, there were only the heart, lungs, and kidney. Apart from that, there was nothing else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">As for the lack of representation for those rank-and-file soldiers, the old demon cultivator could understand—after all, the Three Generals Camp had only recently been established, and although they had achieved a victory in a surprise attack, they were being targeted lately, so morale had suffered. Furthermore, many were poached away by the Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Moreover, among those soldiers, the highest cultivation was only at the Foundation Establishment stage; none had reached the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">And there were no special Foundation Establishment experts on par with Ning Zhuo, so in terms of strength, the soldiers were negligible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Hence, those soldiers were always represented by the monkey’s fur, growing on the outside of its body, not part of the core aspects of the Three Generals Camp’s fortune—dispensable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Yet Ning Zhuo’s battle power is at the Golden Core level, and he’s become the son-in-law of the Grand Marshal’s House. He’s a son of the Ning family, a grand clan, and also serves as the camp’s military advisor. So how is there no sign of his fortune?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Where did it go?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Where is it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Come out! Come out!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The more the old demon cultivator failed to see it, the more alarmed he grew. His expression turned increasingly ferocious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">His massive body suddenly deflated like a balloon that had been punctured!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">His lifespan was burning away without pause!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Meanwhile, the bloody eyeball at his forehead seemed to swell a bit, as though it might burst its socket. Blood mixed with foul, thick yellow fluid seeped from the edges of the eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The agony in body and mind tormented the old demon cultivator, adding layers of pain to his furious countenance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Paying this excruciating price, he finally gained something.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He saw it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Vaguely, he made out the shadow of a left arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">That arm did not remain in one place but roamed freely inside the monkey’s body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sometimes it drifted near the blood-lungs, making a light scooping motion, scooping up countless veins of blood into its hand, then clenching them into a fist, and in the next moment opening its palm—now empty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sometimes it reached the black kidney and made a gentle hook, drawing out a large wave of water. The arm’s shadow seemed like a bottomless pit; the water flowed into it without so much as a sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">When it came near the yellow heart, the monkey face on the heart screeched anxiously, but that did nothing to stop the shadow arm from grabbing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Its five fingers spread wide, seizing a large handful of mysterious energy from within the yellow heart. The arm swiftly absorbed this energy, causing the monkey’s cries to weaken considerably.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Seeing this, the old demon cultivator gaped in speechless shock, his rage erupting in his mind as he roared inwardly, “Thief! This is a thief!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“So that’s it. So that’s it!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“No wonder Liu Er failed, and Ning Zhuo ended up becoming Mu Lan’s husband.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“This thieving bastard Ning Zhuo is stealing Liu Er’s fortune!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Outrageous! Absolutely outrageous!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“He must be exterminated. I have to exterminate him!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Never before had the old demon cultivator’s intent to kill surged so violently, so fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He had never hated anyone so much!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Ning Zhuo!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“You are the true culprit behind Liu Er’s failure. I must wipe you out, must extermi—”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">His roar cut off abruptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In reality, he had already shrunk from a small giant into a dwarf.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">And this dwarf looked so decrepit, pallid like paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">A gust of wind blew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The dwarf scattered into a puff of light smoke, drifting away with the breeze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">By the time the old demon cultivator gathered himself together once more, day had changed into night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“Smoke and Haze Escape has triggered again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“But it was all worth it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“I’ve seen the truth. Now, I shall set up an altar for the ritual, and I’ll use the Snatch Fortune Return Life Curse!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The old demon cultivator’s face was full of vicious fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“You dare steal Liu Er’s fortune, you little thief?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“With seven days and seven nights, I can curse you to death, so that your fortune and destiny will attach to Liu Er for at least seven years!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Burning with hatred, the old demon cultivator put word into deed. He departed Green Forest Immortal City, flew off to a deserted mountaintop, set up an illusory formation, and began his ceremony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">At that very moment, Ning Zhuo had already driven the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, slipping through a stretch of void, arriving at some valley to perform repairs on the mechanical dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was severely damaged on the outside, especially its dragon-scale armor, which had large areas of cracks and destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo stood side by side with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Sun Lingtong frowned at the large swathes of damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, looked distressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Deep in his heart, Ning Zhuo truly loved mechanical creations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">His emotions were complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">He worried about whether he could repair the Mechanical Dragon, yet he also felt excited about personally conducting the restoration, a task that promised an extremely fulfilling experience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Sun Lingtong probed with his spiritual sense, his frown deepening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He thought to himself: “Difficult, difficult, difficult!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“Undoubtedly, restoring the Mechanical Dragon’s outer shell is a massive undertaking. Not only do we need intricate materials, we need extremely advanced forging methods. Most crucially, we must ensure that the armor regains its original hardness and flexibility so it can withstand harsh conditions in the future.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“Later, we’ll be joining battles. We might again face pursuit and bombardment from the Six Caverns Sect’s Nascent Soul experts. We can’t afford the kind of loss we suffered last time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">With that in mind, Sun Lingtong looked to Ning Zhuo and said, “Little Zhuo, I’ll assist you. Just say how, and I’ll do it!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo nodded, then used his spiritual sense to scan the mechanical dragon in detail, examining each crack and damage point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The dragon’s outer armor was badly damaged. In some places, even the inner armor was missing. This became more evident in the second half of the dragon’s body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“The Mechanical Dragon was created by the Molten Lava Immortal Palace, and even the Dragon Tortoise Fire Spirit that oversees it doesn’t fully understand its underlying principles.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“Likewise, I can’t analyze the precise method used to forge its dragon-scale plates.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Although Ning Zhuo’s Five Elements cultivation was profound and his forging ability was outstanding among his peers, the Mechanical Dragon was at the Nascent Soul level and came from the Lava Immortal Palace, which far surpassed his knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Thus, merely identifying how the existing dragon-scale armor had been crafted exceeded his technical limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">“But that doesn’t stop me from repairing the inner and outer armor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">When one’s ability wasn’t enough, one could rely on external resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Pouring in high-grade materials in sufficient quantities could also accomplish wonders —using brute force to break the impasse!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">“It’s just...” Ning Zhuo hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">He had already made a major purchase of materials from Jin Li.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">With the inventory on hand, there were two paths forward:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">One was to use Dragon Scale Iron together with Dragon Soul Grass to refine them in combination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Another was to employ Spotted Star Tear, Thunder Dragon Horn, and Soaring Cloud Seal in the crafting of talismans, which would link with formations and cover the damaged parts of the dragon’s body. Once the formation was activated, the talismans would gradually melt and fuse with the dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">What made Ning Zhuo hesitate was the cost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Dragon Scale Iron complemented the Mechanical Dragon but was only a Golden Core-level material. Dragon Soul Grass reached the Nascent Soul level, but it was in short supply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Hence, the cost was relatively low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Meanwhile, Spotted Star Tear —though only half a drop —was a Soul Formation-level treasure! Thunder Dragon Horn and Soaring Cloud were both Nascent Soul-level materials, too.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">If he took the second approach, the Spotted Star Tear and Thunder Dragon Horn would be completely used up, and only about three or four ounces of Soaring Cloud would remain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">That second option was extremely expensive, perhaps a hundred times the cost of the first, even though the defense gain was merely double.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">“The first plan is already sufficient. The second plan is too extravagant, with costs a hundred times higher but only twice the defensive strength.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“However, war is unpredictable. If in the upcoming battle at the Thousand Peaks Forest we end up regretting not having that extra bit of defense, it’ll be too late.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">By nature, Ning Zhuo tended to be cautious, so he normally would favor the second choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">But the situation was complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Adopting the first plan would free up materials to use elsewhere, enhancing other capabilities. It didn’t necessarily have to go into the Mechanical Dragon; it might boost Ning Zhuo’s personal combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Stuck in indecision, Ning Zhuo avoided acting on his own authority and explained the situation to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Sun Lingtong shrugged and gave his opinion: “Little Zhuo, we’re only beginning the repairs. There’s still a lot more to do afterward. The Mechanical Dragon specializes in escaping and hiding. Improving its defenses won’t help too much.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Ning Zhuo nodded. “Then let’s go with the first—”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">He didn’t even finish his sentence before his expression shifted dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">He looked down at the mechanical ring on his finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The ring was tightening, indicating an impending crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">“What could it be?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">“Is it warning me that choosing the first option is dangerous and that I should choose the second?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Thoughts flashing through his mind, Ning Zhuo immediately made up his mind to adopt the second plan, even though the cost was enormous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Three sticks of incense later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">On a peak near Green Forest Immortal City, the old demon cultivator was already conducting his ritual!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">He chanted the Snatch Fortune Return Life Curse, now having reached its initial phase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">“Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo, you wicked thief up to no good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">“Fortune, fortune, hidden like a shadow in the dark tower.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">“You are strong, but I am stronger, stronger by a thread —yet that thread is as high as the heavens!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">On the high platform, the old demon cultivator brandished a ritual sword in one hand and shook a bell in the other, dancing around in frantic motions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">A single-thread break-fortune incantation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">His body froze abruptly. He glared fiercely, opened his mouth, and roared, “Break!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Right at that moment, Ning Zhuo’s fortune suddenly expanded by two parts, overpowering the old demon cultivator’s by a hair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">Pfft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">The old demon cultivator spewed blood, and his curse was instantly broken, leaving him in piercing pain!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
