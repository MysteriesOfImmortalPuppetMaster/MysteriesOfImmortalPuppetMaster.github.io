<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
“Master? Master!” Liu Er cried out in alarm.<br/>
<br/>
He watched with his eyes wide open as the old demon cultivator transformed into a swirl of complicated, colorful smoke and vanished on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Instinctively, Liu Er reached out to grab him, but caught nothing but air.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er hurriedly activated various incantations to search all around, yet found no trace.<br/>
<br/>
“Could Master have died?” Liu Er’s heart turned cold. For a moment, he remained rooted to the spot, at a loss for what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Before long, he shook his head and muttered to himself, “No, that can’t be it. Master’s methods are so miraculous; how could he possibly fall just from giving me a bit of guidance this once?”<br/>
<br/>
“But Master must have paid a tremendous price this time. That’s for sure.”<br/>
<br/>
“Sigh! He sacrificed so much. I must see my ambition through to repay him!”<br/>
<br/>
After consoling himself like this, Liu Er finally left this patch of woodland, albeit hesitantly.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, thread after thread of smoke appeared out of thin air and converged again at the same spot.<br/>
<br/>
At first, these wisps of smoke were gray-white, giving off a sense of age and frailty. But as the smoke gathered in greater and greater quantity, spots of color began to emerge within the pale smoke, as if it were infused with life.<br/>
<br/>
Before long, the colors became rich and diverse. Suddenly, they compressed and condensed, transforming once again into the old demon cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
The old man’s face and exposed skin were covered in a mix of colors, all kinds of bright hues.<br/>
<br/>
After a few breaths, those brilliant colors quickly faded and withdrew, until his skin appeared no different from an ordinary person’s.<br/>
<br/>
The demon cultivator’s body shuddered; abruptly, he opened his eyes, like a drowning man saved from the water who could finally breathe again, or as though he had broken free from a nightmarish terror and returned to the real world.<br/>
<br/>
“Huff, huff, huff...”<br/>
<br/>
His expression suddenly came to life, filled with shock and alarm.<br/>
<br/>
“How is that possible?!”<br/>
<br/>
“All I did was give the lad a slight bit of guidance. How could I suffer such a terrifying backlash that triggered my life-preserving art—Smoke and Haze Escape?”<br/>
<br/>
“This makes no sense!”<br/>
<br/>
The look of dread froze on the old demon cultivator’s face for a good quarter of an hour before it slowly faded.<br/>
<br/>
He frowned in deep thought. “This is troublesome.”<br/>
<br/>
“Facing someone of strange fate and destiny, using divination carries a weight that is difficult to bear.”<br/>
<br/>
“I only accounted for Liu Er when I calculated the price of giving him guidance.”<br/>
<br/>
“But evidently, that guidance had broader implications and interfered with someone else of formidable power. That’s why I ran into such misfortune.”<br/>
<br/>
With that in mind, the old demon cultivator’s expression grew heavier.<br/>
<br/>
His first suspicion was Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
“My guidance of Liu Er puts Ning Zhuo at the greatest disadvantage.”<br/>
<br/>
“Could the backlash I suffered —nearly fatal —be because of him?”<br/>
<br/>
“Hiss...”<br/>
<br/>
“So Liu Er’s failure might not be primarily because of the Twin Rivers Nation and Mu Lan’s fate, but rather because of Ning Zhuo?!”<br/>
<br/>
At this thought, the old demon cultivator could no longer sit still.<br/>
<br/>
He promptly stood, swallowed a spiritual pearl, then split open his forehead, revealing a bloody eyeball, using it to observe the fortune of the Three Generals Camp.<br/>
<br/>
He saw a three-eared monkey sitting calmly, eyes closed, breathing evenly.<br/>
<br/>
Staring at the image of the monkey, the old demon cultivator’s bloody eye at his brow glinted with mystical radiance, growing ever brighter.<br/>
<br/>
His own flesh shriveled at a speed visible to the naked eye.<br/>
<br/>
In his unique field of vision, the three-eared monkey gradually enlarged, becoming more and more distinct.<br/>
<br/>
He perceived greater secrets.<br/>
<br/>
The monkey’s belly was slightly rounded, suggesting that the Three Generals Camp itself was not short of military supplies.<br/>
<br/>
With every breath the three-eared monkey took, its belly sank a bit, while its overall physique swelled slightly—this represented how the Three Generals Camp was growing stronger with every passing moment.<br/>
<br/>
All of these were positive, upright signs.<br/>
<br/>
But the old demon cultivator was not satisfied with this; he wanted to see even more of the fundamental essence.<br/>
<br/>
He let out a low shout, inhaled sharply, and his entire body inflated into a small giant, seated on the ground, flattening nearby mountains and vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
The old man shut his eyes tight, pouring out all his magical power, spiritual sense, and life essence to fuel the crimson spiritual pearl at his brow.<br/>
<br/>
That eyeball-like orb seemed to convulse: at times, it stared straight ahead, other times it glanced sideways or spun in circles. Sometimes its pupil scattered into countless black dots, which twisted into smoky clouds, then suddenly gathered again.<br/>
<br/>
In the old demon cultivator’s vision, the three-eared monkey magnified further, and its surface layer turned transparent, revealing deeper layers within.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the monkey’s body lay a very simple structure.<br/>
<br/>
There was a heart that was a dull yellow, shaped like a monkey’s head, with a sharp face and hairy cheeks. It wore a sullen expression and, from time to time, when the heart beat, it gave a monkey’s cry filled with anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
The old demon cultivator instantly understood: “That’s Liu Er’s fortune.”<br/>
<br/>
Then he turned to look at the lungs nearby. The lungs were blood-red, filled with veins of blood.<br/>
<br/>
Each of those veins stood rigidly straight, without any smooth curvature at their bends.<br/>
<br/>
And with each breath of the monkey, the blood-lungs pulsed in rhythm.<br/>
<br/>
Most of these pulses were stable, but some were disordered.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever one of those disordered beats occurred, the blood-lungs would spasm, and the rigid veins would emit an eerie purple glow.<br/>
<br/>
“This is Guan Hong’s fortune.”<br/>
<br/>
“Guan Hong practices blood-based demonic arts and is proud and upright by nature. His right arm is wounded and has not healed. That’s a hidden danger.”<br/>
<br/>
Inside the monkey’s body, there was also a kidney.<br/>
<br/>
The kidney was plump and round, entirely pitch-black. The black color churned like a tide, rising and falling repeatedly with booming resonance.<br/>
<br/>
“Zhang Hei practices water-based arts. He’s tough by nature and has considerable family resources; indeed, this kidney imagery suits him perfectly.”<br/>
<br/>
“How strange!”<br/>
<br/>
“Where is Ning Zhuo’s fortune?”<br/>
<br/>
Within the monkey’s body, there were only the heart, lungs, and kidney. Apart from that, there was nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
As for the lack of representation for those rank-and-file soldiers, the old demon cultivator could understand—after all, the Three Generals Camp had only recently been established, and although they had achieved a victory in a surprise attack, they were being targeted lately, so morale had suffered. Furthermore, many were poached away by the Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, among those soldiers, the highest cultivation was only at the Foundation Establishment stage; none had reached the Golden Core level.<br/>
<br/>
And there were no special Foundation Establishment experts on par with Ning Zhuo, so in terms of strength, the soldiers were negligible.<br/>
<br/>
Hence, those soldiers were always represented by the monkey’s fur, growing on the outside of its body, not part of the core aspects of the Three Generals Camp’s fortune—dispensable.<br/>
<br/>
“Yet Ning Zhuo’s battle power is at the Golden Core level, and he’s become the son-in-law of the Grand Marshal’s House. He’s a son of the Ning family, a grand clan, and also serves as the camp’s military advisor. So how is there no sign of his fortune?!”<br/>
<br/>
“Where did it go?”<br/>
<br/>
“Where is it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Come out! Come out!!”<br/>
<br/>
The more the old demon cultivator failed to see it, the more alarmed he grew. His expression turned increasingly ferocious.<br/>
<br/>
His massive body suddenly deflated like a balloon that had been punctured!<br/>
<br/>
His lifespan was burning away without pause!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the bloody eyeball at his forehead seemed to swell a bit, as though it might burst its socket. Blood mixed with foul, thick yellow fluid seeped from the edges of the eye.<br/>
<br/>
The agony in body and mind tormented the old demon cultivator, adding layers of pain to his furious countenance.<br/>
<br/>
Paying this excruciating price, he finally gained something.<br/>
<br/>
He saw it!<br/>
<br/>
Vaguely, he made out the shadow of a left arm.<br/>
<br/>
That arm did not remain in one place but roamed freely inside the monkey’s body.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it drifted near the blood-lungs, making a light scooping motion, scooping up countless veins of blood into its hand, then clenching them into a fist, and in the next moment opening its palm—now empty.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it reached the black kidney and made a gentle hook, drawing out a large wave of water. The arm’s shadow seemed like a bottomless pit; the water flowed into it without so much as a sound.<br/>
<br/>
When it came near the yellow heart, the monkey face on the heart screeched anxiously, but that did nothing to stop the shadow arm from grabbing.<br/>
<br/>
Its five fingers spread wide, seizing a large handful of mysterious energy from within the yellow heart. The arm swiftly absorbed this energy, causing the monkey’s cries to weaken considerably.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, the old demon cultivator gaped in speechless shock, his rage erupting in his mind as he roared inwardly, “Thief! This is a thief!!”<br/>
<br/>
“So that’s it. So that’s it!!”<br/>
<br/>
“No wonder Liu Er failed, and Ning Zhuo ended up becoming Mu Lan’s husband.”<br/>
<br/>
“This thieving bastard Ning Zhuo is stealing Liu Er’s fortune!”<br/>
<br/>
“Outrageous! Absolutely outrageous!”<br/>
<br/>
“He must be exterminated. I have to exterminate him!!”<br/>
<br/>
Never before had the old demon cultivator’s intent to kill surged so violently, so fiercely.<br/>
<br/>
He had never hated anyone so much!<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo!”<br/>
<br/>
“You are the true culprit behind Liu Er’s failure. I must wipe you out, must extermi—”<br/>
<br/>
His roar cut off abruptly.<br/>
<br/>
In reality, he had already shrunk from a small giant into a dwarf.<br/>
<br/>
And this dwarf looked so decrepit, pallid like paper.<br/>
<br/>
A gust of wind blew.<br/>
<br/>
The dwarf scattered into a puff of light smoke, drifting away with the breeze.<br/>
<br/>
By the time the old demon cultivator gathered himself together once more, day had changed into night.<br/>
<br/>
“Smoke and Haze Escape has triggered again.”<br/>
<br/>
“But it was all worth it.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ve seen the truth. Now, I shall set up an altar for the ritual, and I’ll use the Snatch Fortune Return Life Curse!”<br/>
<br/>
The old demon cultivator’s face was full of vicious fury.<br/>
<br/>
“You dare steal Liu Er’s fortune, you little thief?”<br/>
<br/>
“With seven days and seven nights, I can curse you to death, so that your fortune and destiny will attach to Liu Er for at least seven years!”<br/>
<br/>
Burning with hatred, the old demon cultivator put word into deed. He departed Green Forest Immortal City, flew off to a deserted mountaintop, set up an illusory formation, and began his ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
At that very moment, Ning Zhuo had already driven the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, slipping through a stretch of void, arriving at some valley to perform repairs on the mechanical dragon.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was severely damaged on the outside, especially its dragon-scale armor, which had large areas of cracks and destruction.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood side by side with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong frowned at the large swathes of damage.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, looked distressed.<br/>
<br/>
Deep in his heart, Ning Zhuo truly loved mechanical creations.<br/>
<br/>
His emotions were complicated.<br/>
<br/>
He worried about whether he could repair the Mechanical Dragon, yet he also felt excited about personally conducting the restoration, a task that promised an extremely fulfilling experience.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong probed with his spiritual sense, his frown deepening.<br/>
<br/>
He thought to himself: “Difficult, difficult, difficult!”<br/>
<br/>
“Undoubtedly, restoring the Mechanical Dragon’s outer shell is a massive undertaking. Not only do we need intricate materials, we need extremely advanced forging methods. Most crucially, we must ensure that the armor regains its original hardness and flexibility so it can withstand harsh conditions in the future.”<br/>
<br/>
“Later, we’ll be joining battles. We might again face pursuit and bombardment from the Six Caverns Sect’s Nascent Soul experts. We can’t afford the kind of loss we suffered last time.”<br/>
<br/>
With that in mind, Sun Lingtong looked to Ning Zhuo and said, “Little Zhuo, I’ll assist you. Just say how, and I’ll do it!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, then used his spiritual sense to scan the mechanical dragon in detail, examining each crack and damage point.<br/>
<br/>
The dragon’s outer armor was badly damaged. In some places, even the inner armor was missing. This became more evident in the second half of the dragon’s body.<br/>
<br/>
“The Mechanical Dragon was created by the Molten Lava Immortal Palace, and even the Dragon Tortoise Fire Spirit that oversees it doesn’t fully understand its underlying principles.”<br/>
<br/>
“Likewise, I can’t analyze the precise method used to forge its dragon-scale plates.”<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo’s Five Elements cultivation was profound and his forging ability was outstanding among his peers, the Mechanical Dragon was at the Nascent Soul level and came from the Lava Immortal Palace, which far surpassed his knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, merely identifying how the existing dragon-scale armor had been crafted exceeded his technical limits.<br/>
<br/>
“But that doesn’t stop me from repairing the inner and outer armor.”<br/>
<br/>
When one’s ability wasn’t enough, one could rely on external resources.<br/>
<br/>
Pouring in high-grade materials in sufficient quantities could also accomplish wonders —using brute force to break the impasse!<br/>
<br/>
“It’s just...” Ning Zhuo hesitated.<br/>
<br/>
He had already made a major purchase of materials from Jin Li.<br/>
<br/>
With the inventory on hand, there were two paths forward:<br/>
<br/>
One was to use Dragon Scale Iron together with Dragon Soul Grass to refine them in combination.<br/>
<br/>
Another was to employ Spotted Star Tear, Thunder Dragon Horn, and Soaring Cloud Seal in the crafting of talismans, which would link with formations and cover the damaged parts of the dragon’s body. Once the formation was activated, the talismans would gradually melt and fuse with the dragon.<br/>
<br/>
What made Ning Zhuo hesitate was the cost.<br/>
<br/>
Dragon Scale Iron complemented the Mechanical Dragon but was only a Golden Core-level material. Dragon Soul Grass reached the Nascent Soul level, but it was in short supply.<br/>
<br/>
Hence, the cost was relatively low.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Spotted Star Tear —though only half a drop —was a Soul Formation-level treasure! Thunder Dragon Horn and Soaring Cloud were both Nascent Soul-level materials, too.<br/>
<br/>
If he took the second approach, the Spotted Star Tear and Thunder Dragon Horn would be completely used up, and only about three or four ounces of Soaring Cloud would remain.<br/>
<br/>
That second option was extremely expensive, perhaps a hundred times the cost of the first, even though the defense gain was merely double.<br/>
<br/>
“The first plan is already sufficient. The second plan is too extravagant, with costs a hundred times higher but only twice the defensive strength.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, war is unpredictable. If in the upcoming battle at the Thousand Peaks Forest we end up regretting not having that extra bit of defense, it’ll be too late.”<br/>
<br/>
By nature, Ning Zhuo tended to be cautious, so he normally would favor the second choice.<br/>
<br/>
But the situation was complicated.<br/>
<br/>
Adopting the first plan would free up materials to use elsewhere, enhancing other capabilities. It didn’t necessarily have to go into the Mechanical Dragon; it might boost Ning Zhuo’s personal combat power.<br/>
<br/>
Stuck in indecision, Ning Zhuo avoided acting on his own authority and explained the situation to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shrugged and gave his opinion: “Little Zhuo, we’re only beginning the repairs. There’s still a lot more to do afterward. The Mechanical Dragon specializes in escaping and hiding. Improving its defenses won’t help too much.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. “Then let’s go with the first—”<br/>
<br/>
He didn’t even finish his sentence before his expression shifted dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
He looked down at the mechanical ring on his finger.<br/>
<br/>
The ring was tightening, indicating an impending crisis.<br/>
<br/>
“What could it be?”<br/>
<br/>
“Is it warning me that choosing the first option is dangerous and that I should choose the second?”<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts flashing through his mind, Ning Zhuo immediately made up his mind to adopt the second plan, even though the cost was enormous.<br/>
<br/>
Three sticks of incense later.<br/>
<br/>
On a peak near Green Forest Immortal City, the old demon cultivator was already conducting his ritual!<br/>
<br/>
He chanted the Snatch Fortune Return Life Curse, now having reached its initial phase.<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo, you wicked thief up to no good.”<br/>
<br/>
“Fortune, fortune, hidden like a shadow in the dark tower.”<br/>
<br/>
“You are strong, but I am stronger, stronger by a thread —yet that thread is as high as the heavens!”<br/>
<br/>
On the high platform, the old demon cultivator brandished a ritual sword in one hand and shook a bell in the other, dancing around in frantic motions.<br/>
<br/>
A single-thread break-fortune incantation!<br/>
<br/>
His body froze abruptly. He glared fiercely, opened his mouth, and roared, “Break!”<br/>
<br/>
Right at that moment, Ning Zhuo’s fortune suddenly expanded by two parts, overpowering the old demon cultivator’s by a hair.<br/>
<br/>
Pfft.<br/>
<br/>
The old demon cultivator spewed blood, and his curse was instantly broken, leaving him in piercing pain!</div>
