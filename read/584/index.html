<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The paper attendant guided Yang Weida to the Pavilion of Quiet Whispers, gesturing for him to wait momentarily by the entrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Yang Weida maintained a composed facade, quickly nodding in acknowledgment, though the nervous tension within him was evident to anyone observing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He stood at the entrance, his heart barely managing a few beats before the paper attendant received further instructions. The doors opened silently, signaling for Yang Weida to enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Swallowing hard, Yang Weida adjusted his collar, steeled himself against his anxiety, and stepped lightly into the Pavilion of Quiet Whispers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Previously, when Sang Le Youling had suffered a near-fatal assassination attempt, the Pavilion had been severely damaged. However, White Paper Immortal City promptly allocated significant resources to rebuild it. Due to comprehensive upgrades, particularly the reinforcement of defensive formations, the Pavilion was now safer than ever before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sang Le Youling always summoned the male consorts undergoing evaluation individually to this pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">As Yang Weida entered, he saw Sang Le Youling seated cross-legged behind a small table. He immediately prepared to pay his respects, but Sang Le Youling didn’t even glance his way. Instead, she gently plucked the strings of the charred-tail zither resting atop the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The crystalline notes resonated deeply within Yang Weida’s heart. Through the music, a subtle message conveyed that formalities were unnecessary - he was simply to sit down and listen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Yang Weida repeatedly nodded in obedience, promptly complying with her instructions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Sang Le Youling delicately strummed the instrument with two fingers, the music stark yet clear, akin to a tranquil, depthless well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Seven yellow jade bells chimed one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The first bell sounded like ice fracturing; the second resembled autumn leaves gently decaying; the third felt like droplets from a hidden spring...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Soon, Yang Weida was completely captivated by the ethereal melody.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He "saw" the flame in the bronze lantern on the table suddenly distort into a panicked human face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He "saw" his own shadow, cast upon the blue bricks, twist grotesquely, dancing frantically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He "saw" beneath a bleak moon, countless evil spirits crawling over his body, clawing and gnawing relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">As these visions overwhelmed Yang Weida, Sang Le Youling's expression grew increasingly serious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Eventually, all hallucinations dissipated from Yang Weida’s mind, leaving behind only a pervasive sensation of helpless weakness. This overwhelming fatigue made him long to collapse onto a bed and remain motionless for days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sang Le Youling’s fingers trembled slightly as she plucked the final note.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Yang Weida received another subtle indication instructing him to leave silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He harbored numerous doubts, desperate to know whether he had passed the evaluation. Yet he dared not speak, quietly retreating from the pavilion without making the slightest noise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sang Le Youling sat alone in the Pavilion of Quiet Whispers, the gentle breeze rustling the bamboo outside and stirring her dark hair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">She sighed softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Wen Ruanyu emerged from the rear chamber. "How did it go?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Since Sang Le Youling had twice faced assassination attempts, ensuring her safety had become paramount. Concerned about potential infiltrators among the male consorts, White Paper Immortal City had assigned Wen Ruanyu to protect Sang Le Youling personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Yang Weida had been brought into the city under Wen Ruanyu’s guidance, acting on Sang Le Youling’s instructions, making Wen Ruanyu especially vigilant regarding him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">This time, Yang Weida had risen abruptly, claiming the top position among the consorts, standing out prominently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sang Le Youling sighed once more. "His background is clear. He truly is a traveling merchant from Flying Cloud Nation. This time, he volunteered to become a male consort, aiming to leverage this identity to gain favor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Wen Ruanyu nodded thoughtfully. "Friend or foe isn't crucial here. The key question is, could he be the person you foresaw - the crucial figure to help our city survive the ghost tide?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Sang Le Youling shook her head gently. "I cannot be certain yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"However," she continued, "his Yang energy is genuinely powerful, and he rightly holds first place among this batch of consorts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Wen Ruanyu queried further, "Compared to Jin Yangzi?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Jin Yangzi is a direct disciple of the Seven Feather Alliance, carrying remnants of the Three-legged Golden Crow bloodline. How could Yang Weida compare?" replied Sang Le Youling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Wen Ruanyu pondered, "If Yang Weida truly is that pivotal figure, perhaps he could become the new master of the Golden Swallow Trident. Only that artifact can produce enough Yang energy to help the City Lord dispel the accumulated Yin energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Yang Weida is merely at the Foundation stage," Sang Le Youling noted. "Your scenario seems the most feasible at present. But predictions rarely align perfectly with reality."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"I still cannot decisively confirm Yang Weida as the savior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Therefore, we must remain open to various possibilities," she concluded. "Keeping our options open ensures we do not overlook the true key individual."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Wen Ruanyu nodded, clearly agreeing with her reasoning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Back in the Hidden Yang Manor, Yang Weida was immediately bombarded with questions upon his return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Everyone wanted details of the assessment with Sang Le Youling to prepare themselves better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Uncertain of his own results yet unwilling to appear weak, Yang Weida confidently assured them he'd passed effortlessly. His words blended truth and exaggeration, emphasizing the remarkable power of his own miraculous medicines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">To glean inside information, the male consorts had to buy at least one box of miraculous medicine from Yang Weida.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Whether I pass or not, just from this one massive sale, my trip to White Paper Immortal City has been completely worth it!" Yang Weida had already recouped his costs and felt much more at ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">However, Ning Zhuo didn't follow the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">For him, ascending into the Three Courts was of no interest whatsoever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo planned to immediately reveal his true identity upon meeting Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, request her divination assistance, and then swiftly depart on his Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, leaving behind this troublesome place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">-----</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">The Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">Valley Lord Ash Bone Elder impatiently regarded his visitor: "Governor, I've already paid off my debt with the last divination."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">In the Underworld, anyone titled 'Governor' was surely the lord of an Underworld Province - a figure of immense authority, comparable to a mortal king in the human world, ruling over numerous Immortal Cities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">The Governor nodded: "Indeed. Rest assured, Ash Bone Elder, I haven't come for divination this time but for another pressing matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Ash Bone Elder was momentarily stunned, then performed a quick calculation: "You want me to disrupt someone's divination?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">The Governor openly admitted, "Precisely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Ash Bone Elder replied, "I do have one such technique called Calamity Ash Fate Confusion, capable of obscuring divination. However, its cost is steep - even more significant than repaying your previous favor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">The Governor produced an object: "Elder Grey, your greatest concern has always been your fate and longevity. I understand that confusing divinations rarely consumes lifespan directly. Could this object possibly compensate?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Ash Bone Elder’s gaze was instantly drawn to the item: "Is this the shell of a Ten-Thousand-Year Black Tortoise?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">"Exactly," the Governor confirmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">After a brief silence, Ash Bone Elder acknowledged, "This treasure is indeed sufficient. But to execute Calamity Ash Fate Confusion, I must harness Calamity Qi, transforming it into ash for the ritual."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Surprised, the Governor asked, "Do you intend to harvest Calamity Qi from the ghost tide?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Ash Bone Elder chuckled, "Governor, let's not waste each other's time with such pretenses. Others might be ignorant, but not me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">"This ghost tide resulted from your defiance of heavenly laws, attempting to refine the Heavenly Ghost Skull. The entirety of White Paper Immortal City remains oblivious, inadvertently sharing your divine punishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Hearing this, the Governor’s expression became utterly severe, eyes sharpened with menace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Undeterred, Ash Bone Elder continued, "To obscure divinations, I must directly access the source of this calamity and harvest Calamity Qi - only such potent energy can truly confuse the fate readings and deeply impact all cultivators involved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">"There’s no alternative."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">The Governor fell into profound silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">To appease Heaven's wrath, blood sacrifice was most effective, and White Paper Immortal City had long been earmarked as his sacrificial site.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">However, the city was easily defensible yet challenging to conquer, primarily because Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer stood as its defensive core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Despite multiple assassination attempts by the Governor in collaboration with the City-Overthrowing Alliance, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had thwarted every plot through her preemptive divinations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Thus, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had become an insufferable thorn in the Governor and the Alliance's side, one they wished fervently to eliminate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">Confusing divinations was exceedingly costly, yet the situation demanded the Governor take this step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">After a prolonged pause, the Governor stared firmly at Ash Bone Elder and said slowly, "Agreed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">A day later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">In the dining hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Ning Zhuo sat upright, watching as the Spirit Chef Elder cooked Underworld Cuisine before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">As usual, after consuming the dishes, Ning Zhuo felt his stomach swell, leaving him barely able to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">As he digested the food, his soul foundation decisively surpassed a thousandfold compared to ordinary cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">"Little brat, you've become a Thousand-Man Soul," the Spirit Chef Elder immediately sensed the overflowing aura from Ning Zhuo’s soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, "It's all thanks to your assistance, Senior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">The elder snorted coldly, "Stop flattering! Your achievement owes partly to your willingness to spend contributions specifically on my Underworld dishes and partly to the city's policy adjustments which granted access to abundant rare ingredients. Usually, this would never happen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Ning Zhuo nodded, "I understand. The ghost tide has besieged the city for days."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">The elder shook his head, "It's not merely that. Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer sustained injuries in the previous assassination attempt and has been consuming my Spirit Cuisine to recover. That’s why I received these precious resources. She’s the main recipient - you're merely tagging along."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">"Don't think Hidden Yang Mansion would specially allocate these precious resources for you alone. Consider yourself lucky to benefit from this favorable situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">Ning Zhuo exclaimed softly, "I see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">A thought occurred to him, "Senior, are you hinting that I should thank Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer personally later?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">This time, among the male consorts ascending into the Three Courts, Ning Zhuo was included.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">This afternoon, it was Ning Zhuo’s turn to visit Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">The Spirit Chef Elder nodded gravely. "I've been in White Paper Immortal City for many years now. Keeping this city intact has been no easy task. Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer has contributed greatly, especially now when even the City Lord is considering sealing herself away."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">Thinking back on recent battles, Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement. "That's very true."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">The Spirit Chef Elder fixed Ning Zhuo with a serious gaze. "Jiao Ma, you're the first among the male consorts to persistently eat my Underworld Cuisine for so many days. You've got grit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">"Moreover, you're from a village outside the city; White Paper Immortal City is your home."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">"Would you be interested in inheriting my skills, becoming a Spirit Chef? Then, you'd cook for yourself, stay here, and perhaps gain the favor of influential figures like the City Lord and Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, changing your fate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Surprised, Ning Zhuo responded honestly, "Actually... I'm more inclined to venture outside and see the wider world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">The Spirit Chef Elder snorted, visibly displeased, but still handed over a jade slip and a token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">"Spirit cooking is among the hundred cultivation arts, with its own traditions and rules."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">"This inheritance I give you must not be shared carelessly. Learn it or not, it’s your choice. But if you do, remember: you belong to the Dark Cuisine School, and you must carry forth this legacy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">"Within the jade slip are my cultivation methods, recipes, and insights. The token signifies your sect and your identity. When participating in the Hundred Kingdoms Culinary Competition in the future, this will be your entrance and participant credential."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Ning Zhuo hadn’t expected that simply eating Underworld Cuisine for several days would yield him an unexpected Spirit Chef inheritance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Though appearing fierce, the Spirit Chef Elder had clearly taken a liking to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Thinking it wise to have more skills at hand, the clever young man considered briefly before seriously agreeing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">Carrying the jade slip and the identity token, Ning Zhuo left the dining hall. Shortly after, he was guided by a paper attendant to a small residence, where a teleportation array took him directly to Pavillion of Quiet Whispers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Standing outside, Ning Zhuo anxiously rubbed his mechanism ring a few times. When there was no reaction, he felt reassured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">After only a brief wait, the paper attendant pushed the door open, signaling Ning Zhuo to enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Inside, Ning Zhuo saw a female cultivator seated calmly behind a desk, hands resting silently on a zither, unmoving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">The door closed softly behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">Ning Zhuo respectfully announced his identity and purpose, but Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer made no response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Puzzled, he raised his head to observe closely, when suddenly Sun Lingtong’s urgent voice rang out: "Something’s wrong! This situation isn’t right!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">"Little Zhuo, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer is dead!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">"What?!" Ning Zhuo felt his hair stand on end, dread gripping him instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">He rushed forward for a closer look. Indeed, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was lifeless!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Sun Lingtong called out urgently, "We can't linger here, let's go-"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Before he could finish, alarms blared fiercely. The defensive arrays of Pavillion of Quiet Whispers activated, sealing the space and locking both Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo firmly inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">"Intruders! Intruders!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">"Another assassination on Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">"We'll cut these murderers to pieces!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">In moments, hordes of city guards surged forward, heavily surrounding Pavillion of Quiet Whispers.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
