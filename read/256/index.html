<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 256: My Goods Have Been Stolen!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A violent explosion echoed from afar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Xiaohui instinctively looked up, gazing towards the western sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sure enough, a crack appeared in the light barrier to the west, allowing three Fire Snakes to infiltrate and crash to the ground one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The battle drills on the ground were activated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Xiaohui quickly turned her attention back to the gourd-shaped furnace before her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Recently, she had been driven to madness by Ning Zhuo's provocations, relentlessly striving for achievements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">At this moment, Ning Xiaohui was noticeably thinner, with sunken eyes and dark circles, clearly showing her extreme exhaustion both physically and mentally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Yet, her eyes sparkled with a crazed determination, bloodshot and filled with a manic energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">A sudden wave of dizziness hit her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Xiaohui sat cross-legged on the ground, her upper body swaying slightly before she steadied herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"This is the critical moment of refining, I can't slack off!" She hurriedly took out a pill bottle, uncorked it, and poured the pills into her mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">She swallowed five or six pills in one go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">As the pills entered her stomach, Ning Xiaohui felt rejuvenated, as if the medicinal power was inflating her deflated body, filling her with energy once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Just hold on a bit longer, once I refine this batch of materials, I'll earn another five achievements!" Ning Xiaohui knew her initial advantage would diminish over time, so she acted with urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">She utilized her innate talent, the Ice Jade Hand, to repair various mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The rewards for such tasks were often substantial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">However, the frequent use of her talent took a toll on Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">So, during breaks, she would come to the gourd furnace forest to take on refining tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Lava Immortal Palace had numerous furnaces, categorized into copper, iron, silver, and gold grades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The gourd-shaped furnaces were spaced apart, arranged in an orderly fashion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">From a distance, they resembled a vast gourd forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Unlike the Medical Pavilion, Five Elements Tower, or Command Platform, the furnaces were open to the public.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Even outsiders without the status of trial disciples could easily take on refining tasks here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Xiaohui sat cross-legged in front of the furnace, waves of scorching heat blowing her hair, turning it dry and yellow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">She stared intently at the furnace, not relaxing for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"My achievements have reached one hundred and twenty-seven."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Just thirty more, and I can secure a position at the Historical Records Pavilion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Ning Xiaohui, give it your all! Show Ning Zhuo and the others the might of the Ning family's main branch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"This time, I must win, I cannot lose!" Ning Xiaohui shouted in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Xiaohui was ostracized and forced into the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This situation made her feel cornered, with no retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The past humiliations, the pressure from Ning Zhuo's pursuit, the expectations of the Golden Core ancestors—all these factors piled on her, igniting the strongest fighting spirit she had ever felt!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Lava Immortal Palace, Main Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">On the throne, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was pacing anxiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Its gaze pierced through the void, watching Ning Xiaohui and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Seeing Ning Zhuo sleeping soundly, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit complained, "Stop sleeping, the situation is dire, and you still have the mind to sleep?" "Look at Ning Xiaohui, how hard she's working!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Of course, it didn't dare say these words directly to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">It was merely venting its emotions to itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was truly anxious!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Not knowing Ning Xiaohui's real progress might have been better, but the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been keeping a close eye on her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Every time it saw Ning Xiaohui making progress, inching closer to the position at the Historical Records Pavilion, it felt tormented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Zhu Xuanji, that old fellow, is also up to no good, secretly using Ning Zhuo to provoke Ning Xiaohui." After pacing around for a while, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could no longer hold back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">It took a deep breath and reached out to contact Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Young Master, Young Master..." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit called out in a weak and affectionate tone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo, who had just fallen asleep, was awakened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He opened his weary eyes and asked weakly, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, has your condition improved?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit smiled bitterly, "No, Young Master, my condition worsens by the moment, but the situation is too urgent now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"I have to muster all my strength to tell you, that Ning Xiaohui! She is a huge threat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Her achievements are just about thirty away from securing the lowest position at the Historical Records Pavilion!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Young Master, you must deal with her quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo sighed, expressing his own frustration and difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Ning Xiaohui must be stopped."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"But I have no opportunity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"The Golden Core ancestors are nearby, and Zhu Xuanji is always watching me, suspecting me." Ning Zhuo reassured the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, "With over thirty achievements left, Ning Xiaohui still has a way to go before success."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"We still have some time, it's not the final moment yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"At this time, we must remain calm and find the right opportunity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so anxious it was jumping on the throne, "Calm, how can I be calm! Oh dear, you're driving me crazy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Of course, it didn't dare say this to Ning Zhuo, only venting in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to instruct the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit to keep a close watch on NIng Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He also asked the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit about a question it hadn't answered last time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Reluctantly, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit confirmed Ning Zhuo's suspicion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">As the head of the Medical Pavilion, one could indeed earn a share of the achievements from subordinates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">However, if the subordinates failed a task, the head would also bear responsibility, resulting in a deduction of achievements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This outcome was slightly different from what Ning Zhuo had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Just as Ning Zhuo was about to continue questioning the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, it abruptly cut off the connection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">It held its head, lying on the throne's armrest, lamenting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Every communication with Ning Zhuo cost it information and losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Yet, it had to rely on Ning Zhuo to deal with Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">It was almost unbearable; these days were truly hard to endure!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo called out to the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit repeatedly, but received no response, and sighed deeply, lying motionless on the bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He stared at the ceiling, feeling heavy-hearted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo wanted to stop Ning Xiaohui and obtain information from the Historical Records Pavilion, but had no opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The protection from the Golden Core cultivators was indeed too thorough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo was also filled with anxiety and unease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">With each passing day, the pressure from Ning Xiaohui grew stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">But Ning Zhuo knew he had to be extremely cautious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Reaching this point had not been easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">As a mere Qi Refining cultivator dealing with Golden Core cultivators, he had to be vigilant at all times, keeping his nerves taut, avoiding any mistakes!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">If he couldn't withstand the pressure and rashly acted against Ning Xiaohui, he would fall into Zhu Xuanji's trap, exposing himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zhu Xuanji and the Golden Core cultivators used the reformation team as bait, trying to lure out the true culprit behind the bombardment of Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Similarly, Zhu Xuanji was using Ning Xiaohui as bait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">If Ning Zhuo took the bait in haste, Zhu Xuanji would be the happiest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Wait!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Even if it means gritting my teeth, I must wait."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Wait for the right opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"What's taking Song Fuli so long to realize he's been robbed?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The next day, at the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">After receiving permission, Song Fuli entered the study to meet Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Fei Si noticed Song Fuli's gloomy expression and felt a pang of anxiety, but maintained a smile as he inquired about Song Fuli's visit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Song Fuli's words shocked Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"What?! All the auction items prepared by your side have been stolen?" Fei Si exclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Song Fuli nodded gravely, "Such a serious matter, how could I joke with you, Lord Fei Si?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"We only just discovered it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"As soon as we found out, we sealed the scene, and I came straight to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"All along, since we settled in Lava Immortal City, we've strictly adhered to the rules, keeping our goods and magical artifacts within the prescribed limits."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"We could have set up higher-grade formations to protect our goods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"But because we were bound by your city's rules, our protection was less than sixty percent effective."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Now that this has happened, I ask for your assistance, Lord Fei Si. After all, our goods were lost within Fire Persimmon Immortal City." Though Song Fuli's words were a request, his tone was anxious, hinting at blame towards the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Fei Si dared not be careless, immediately rising to accompany Song Fuli back to inspect the scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">At the treasure vault, the shelves were filled with counterfeit goods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">If Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu were present, they would recognize these fakes as their handiwork, without exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Fei Si also examined the surrounding formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">To protect the goods of the cloud merchants, the City Lord's Mansion had made efforts, integrating the city's grand formation with the temporary formations here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Strictly speaking, the defense here was not weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Yet, the fact before Fei Si was that the cloud merchants' goods had indeed been stolen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"This is a tricky situation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Fei Si furrowed his brow deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">This incident alone was already troublesome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">If not handled properly, Fire Persimmon Immortal City would suffer a severe loss of reputation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">As a city, if it couldn't ensure the safety of the goods of visiting merchants, how could it expect them to willingly limit their strength?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">If this reputation couldn't be restored, in a vicious cycle, fewer and fewer merchant caravans would come to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">This would be extremely detrimental to the city's development.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Moreover, the City Lord's Mansion hoped to rely on the cloud merchants to help defend Fire Persimmon Immortal City and the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Who on earth dared to steal the cloud merchants' treasures at such a critical moment?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Damn it, they deserve to die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Fei Si was extremely angry, suppressing his rage to remain calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"We will certainly give Brother Song an explanation!" Fei Si immediately assured Song Fuli, doing his best to appease him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">After ordering the continued sealing of the scene, Fei Si left Cloud City, first reporting to Meng Kui, then contacting Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Divine Constable, we need your help!" Fei Si pleaded, disregarding his own dignity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Zhu Xuanji received his "call for help," sighed lightly, and wore a worried expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The cloud merchants led by Song Fuli were indeed a powerful ally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Especially the Cloud Whale beast, which was at the Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">In case several Nascent Soul-level Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts attacked together, Zhu Xuanji hoped the Cloud Whale could help Meng Xiao bear some of the pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Looks like I need to make a trip."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Investigate thoroughly, capture the culprit, and do our best to recover the stolen treasures!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"On this basis, try to win over the cloud merchants..."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
