<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
A violent explosion echoed from afar.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui instinctively looked up, gazing towards the western sky.<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, a crack appeared in the light barrier to the west, allowing three Fire Snakes to infiltrate and crash to the ground one after another.<br/>
<br/>
The battle drills on the ground were activated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui quickly turned her attention back to the gourd-shaped furnace before her.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, she had been driven to madness by Ning Zhuo's provocations, relentlessly striving for achievements.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Xiaohui was noticeably thinner, with sunken eyes and dark circles, clearly showing her extreme exhaustion both physically and mentally.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, her eyes sparkled with a crazed determination, bloodshot and filled with a manic energy.<br/>
<br/>
A sudden wave of dizziness hit her.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui sat cross-legged on the ground, her upper body swaying slightly before she steadied herself.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the critical moment of refining, I can't slack off!" She hurriedly took out a pill bottle, uncorked it, and poured the pills into her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
She swallowed five or six pills in one go.<br/>
<br/>
As the pills entered her stomach, Ning Xiaohui felt rejuvenated, as if the medicinal power was inflating her deflated body, filling her with energy once more.<br/>
<br/>
"Just hold on a bit longer, once I refine this batch of materials, I'll earn another five achievements!" Ning Xiaohui knew her initial advantage would diminish over time, so she acted with urgency.<br/>
<br/>
She utilized her innate talent, the Ice Jade Hand, to repair various mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
The rewards for such tasks were often substantial.<br/>
<br/>
However, the frequent use of her talent took a toll on Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
So, during breaks, she would come to the gourd furnace forest to take on refining tasks.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace had numerous furnaces, categorized into copper, iron, silver, and gold grades.<br/>
<br/>
The gourd-shaped furnaces were spaced apart, arranged in an orderly fashion.<br/>
<br/>
From a distance, they resembled a vast gourd forest.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the Medical Pavilion, Five Elements Tower, or Command Platform, the furnaces were open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Even outsiders without the status of trial disciples could easily take on refining tasks here.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui sat cross-legged in front of the furnace, waves of scorching heat blowing her hair, turning it dry and yellow.<br/>
<br/>
She stared intently at the furnace, not relaxing for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
"My achievements have reached one hundred and twenty-seven."<br/>
<br/>
"Just thirty more, and I can secure a position at the Historical Records Pavilion."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui, give it your all! Show Ning Zhuo and the others the might of the Ning family's main branch."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, I must win, I cannot lose!" Ning Xiaohui shouted in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui was ostracized and forced into the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
This situation made her feel cornered, with no retreat.<br/>
<br/>
The past humiliations, the pressure from Ning Zhuo's pursuit, the expectations of the Golden Core ancestors‚Äîall these factors piled on her, igniting the strongest fighting spirit she had ever felt!<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace, Main Hall.<br/>
<br/>
On the throne, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was pacing anxiously.<br/>
<br/>
Its gaze pierced through the void, watching Ning Xiaohui and Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo sleeping soundly, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit complained, "Stop sleeping, the situation is dire, and you still have the mind to sleep?" "Look at Ning Xiaohui, how hard she's working!"<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it didn't dare say these words directly to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
It was merely venting its emotions to itself.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was truly anxious!<br/>
<br/>
Not knowing Ning Xiaohui's real progress might have been better, but the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been keeping a close eye on her.<br/>
<br/>
Every time it saw Ning Xiaohui making progress, inching closer to the position at the Historical Records Pavilion, it felt tormented.<br/>
<br/>
"Zhu Xuanji, that old fellow, is also up to no good, secretly using Ning Zhuo to provoke Ning Xiaohui." After pacing around for a while, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could no longer hold back.<br/>
<br/>
It took a deep breath and reached out to contact Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master, Young Master..." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit called out in a weak and affectionate tone.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, who had just fallen asleep, was awakened.<br/>
<br/>
He opened his weary eyes and asked weakly, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, has your condition improved?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit smiled bitterly, "No, Young Master, my condition worsens by the moment, but the situation is too urgent now."<br/>
<br/>
"I have to muster all my strength to tell you, that Ning Xiaohui! She is a huge threat."<br/>
<br/>
"Her achievements are just about thirty away from securing the lowest position at the Historical Records Pavilion!"<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master, you must deal with her quickly!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed, expressing his own frustration and difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui must be stopped."<br/>
<br/>
"But I have no opportunity!"<br/>
<br/>
"The Golden Core ancestors are nearby, and Zhu Xuanji is always watching me, suspecting me." Ning Zhuo reassured the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, "With over thirty achievements left, Ning Xiaohui still has a way to go before success."<br/>
<br/>
"We still have some time, it's not the final moment yet."<br/>
<br/>
"At this time, we must remain calm and find the right opportunity!"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so anxious it was jumping on the throne, "Calm, how can I be calm! Oh dear, you're driving me crazy."<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it didn't dare say this to Ning Zhuo, only venting in secret.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to instruct the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit to keep a close watch on NIng Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
He also asked the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit about a question it hadn't answered last time.<br/>
<br/>
Reluctantly, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit confirmed Ning Zhuo's suspicion.<br/>
<br/>
As the head of the Medical Pavilion, one could indeed earn a share of the achievements from subordinates.<br/>
<br/>
However, if the subordinates failed a task, the head would also bear responsibility, resulting in a deduction of achievements.<br/>
<br/>
This outcome was slightly different from what Ning Zhuo had anticipated.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Ning Zhuo was about to continue questioning the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, it abruptly cut off the connection.<br/>
<br/>
It held its head, lying on the throne's armrest, lamenting.<br/>
<br/>
Every communication with Ning Zhuo cost it information and losses.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, it had to rely on Ning Zhuo to deal with Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
It was almost unbearable; these days were truly hard to endure!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo called out to the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit repeatedly, but received no response, and sighed deeply, lying motionless on the bed.<br/>
<br/>
He stared at the ceiling, feeling heavy-hearted.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo wanted to stop Ning Xiaohui and obtain information from the Historical Records Pavilion, but had no opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
The protection from the Golden Core cultivators was indeed too thorough.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was also filled with anxiety and unease.<br/>
<br/>
With each passing day, the pressure from Ning Xiaohui grew stronger.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo knew he had to be extremely cautious.<br/>
<br/>
Reaching this point had not been easy.<br/>
<br/>
As a mere Qi Refining cultivator dealing with Golden Core cultivators, he had to be vigilant at all times, keeping his nerves taut, avoiding any mistakes!<br/>
<br/>
If he couldn't withstand the pressure and rashly acted against Ning Xiaohui, he would fall into Zhu Xuanji's trap, exposing himself.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and the Golden Core cultivators used the reformation team as bait, trying to lure out the true culprit behind the bombardment of Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, Zhu Xuanji was using Ning Xiaohui as bait.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo took the bait in haste, Zhu Xuanji would be the happiest.<br/>
<br/>
"Wait!"<br/>
<br/>
"Even if it means gritting my teeth, I must wait."<br/>
<br/>
"Wait for the right opportunity."<br/>
<br/>
"What's taking Song Fuli so long to realize he's been robbed?"<br/>
<br/>
The next day, at the City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
After receiving permission, Song Fuli entered the study to meet Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si noticed Song Fuli's gloomy expression and felt a pang of anxiety, but maintained a smile as he inquired about Song Fuli's visit.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli's words shocked Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
"What?! All the auction items prepared by your side have been stolen?" Fei Si exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli nodded gravely, "Such a serious matter, how could I joke with you, Lord Fei Si?"<br/>
<br/>
"We only just discovered it!"<br/>
<br/>
"As soon as we found out, we sealed the scene, and I came straight to you."<br/>
<br/>
"All along, since we settled in Lava Immortal City, we've strictly adhered to the rules, keeping our goods and magical artifacts within the prescribed limits."<br/>
<br/>
"We could have set up higher-grade formations to protect our goods."<br/>
<br/>
"But because we were bound by your city's rules, our protection was less than sixty percent effective."<br/>
<br/>
"Now that this has happened, I ask for your assistance, Lord Fei Si. After all, our goods were lost within Fire Persimmon Immortal City." Though Song Fuli's words were a request, his tone was anxious, hinting at blame towards the City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si dared not be careless, immediately rising to accompany Song Fuli back to inspect the scene.<br/>
<br/>
At the treasure vault, the shelves were filled with counterfeit goods.<br/>
<br/>
If Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu were present, they would recognize these fakes as their handiwork, without exception.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si also examined the surrounding formations.<br/>
<br/>
To protect the goods of the cloud merchants, the City Lord's Mansion had made efforts, integrating the city's grand formation with the temporary formations here.<br/>
<br/>
Strictly speaking, the defense here was not weak.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, the fact before Fei Si was that the cloud merchants' goods had indeed been stolen!<br/>
<br/>
"This is a tricky situation!"<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si furrowed his brow deeply.<br/>
<br/>
This incident alone was already troublesome.<br/>
<br/>
If not handled properly, Fire Persimmon Immortal City would suffer a severe loss of reputation.<br/>
<br/>
As a city, if it couldn't ensure the safety of the goods of visiting merchants, how could it expect them to willingly limit their strength?<br/>
<br/>
If this reputation couldn't be restored, in a vicious cycle, fewer and fewer merchant caravans would come to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
This would be extremely detrimental to the city's development.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the City Lord's Mansion hoped to rely on the cloud merchants to help defend Fire Persimmon Immortal City and the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
"Who on earth dared to steal the cloud merchants' treasures at such a critical moment?"<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it, they deserve to die!"<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si was extremely angry, suppressing his rage to remain calm.<br/>
<br/>
"We will certainly give Brother Song an explanation!" Fei Si immediately assured Song Fuli, doing his best to appease him.<br/>
<br/>
After ordering the continued sealing of the scene, Fei Si left Cloud City, first reporting to Meng Kui, then contacting Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
"Divine Constable, we need your help!" Fei Si pleaded, disregarding his own dignity.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji received his "call for help," sighed lightly, and wore a worried expression.<br/>
<br/>
The cloud merchants led by Song Fuli were indeed a powerful ally.<br/>
<br/>
Especially the Cloud Whale beast, which was at the Nascent Soul level.<br/>
<br/>
In case several Nascent Soul-level Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts attacked together, Zhu Xuanji hoped the Cloud Whale could help Meng Xiao bear some of the pressure.<br/>
<br/>
"Looks like I need to make a trip."<br/>
<br/>
"Investigate thoroughly, capture the culprit, and do our best to recover the stolen treasures!"<br/>
<br/>
"On this basis, try to win over the cloud merchants..."</div>
