<paragraph index="1">Ning Ze listened quietly, his gaze flickering slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"So that's how it is." Only now did he understand part of what had transpired.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Ze slowly nodded, "Lan'er, you did well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Wang Lan said, "I'm still trembling with fear. Today was too dangerous. I never thought Little Zhuo would actually pull it off! I... I don't know how to face him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"After all, he saved you and brought down that damned Ning Xiaoren." Ning Gui sighed, "This is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. Little Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"I misjudged him before. I underestimated him too much."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"No matter if he had guidance from a higher power this time, just his demeanor and conduct at the banquet show that he is no ordinary person. From now on, we must follow closely behind him and support him as much as possible. Let Ji'er follow him. After all, they are cousins." Wang Lan was shocked, "Ah? Husband, you mean..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Ze glared, "Can't you see it? With Little Zhuo's reputation and talent, he will at least be an elder in the future. Didn't you see the elders from the other branches like Ning Houjun and Ning Youfu personally stepping in to support Little Zhuo and show goodwill?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Does Ji'er have talent? Little Zhuo's future is not something Ji'er can compare to. Let Ji'er follow Little Zhuo now, and the latter, out of past affection, will help Ji'er, saving him countless hardships." Wang Lan was worried, "But Ji'er and Little Zhuo's relationship, husband, you know it well. Although they are cousins, they have never gotten along since childhood. Their relationship is not good at all." Ning Ze shook his head, "You, you, you are just a woman after all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"You haven't seen it clearly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Let me ask you, how is Little Zhuo's relationship with us as a couple?" Wang Lan hesitated and shook her head, "Not close."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Ze snorted, "To be precise, it's very bad!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"But this time, he cleared my name and saved me. Why? Is it because he is filial to us? Because he remembers our upbringing?" Wang Lan blinked and hesitated, "Although we favored Ji'er more, we did raise Little Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Ze shook his head, "The biggest reason Little Zhuo saved me is that he could rely on me to bring down Ning Xiaoren."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Another reason is that I am his closest relative in this world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"He wants to progress and rise high, so he must be impeccable in character. Therefore, he will certainly take care of us because of this blood relationship."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"From the banquet just now, I have confirmed—Little Zhuo has this understanding and magnanimity!" Wang Lan said, "If that's the case, then why do we need to curry favor with Little Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Ze shook his head again, "Little Zhuo will treat us well because our blood relationship is extremely close."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"By the same token, the main family will also see us as being on Little Zhuo's side because of this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Especially today, we testified against Ning Xiaoren! This means that even if we don't want to, we are seen as Little Zhuo's people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"We are already tied to Little Zhuo. We share honor and disgrace together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Wang Lan's eyes widened, "So that's how it is."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Ze continued, "Since we are already deeply bound to Little Zhuo, why not go all out and support him fully?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"He has talent and such magnanimity. Relying on him is not a bad thing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Wang Lan fell into silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The boy she once looked down upon had now become the person their entire family needed to curry favor with and rely on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">This made her mindset difficult to adjust for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">After a long time, she slowly nodded, her tone desolate, "Husband, you are right. We... we will rely on Little Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Ze nodded, "Tomorrow morning, I will explain this decision to Ji'er."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The couple discussed and then went to bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In Ning Zhuo's cultivation chamber, he was still completing today's practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Amidst layers of floating clouds, his entire body was covered in a blood-red glow, forming membranes that covered his upper body, with a few covering his lower body, making him look as if he was wearing a layer of blood armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique had already reached the peak of the sixth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But the Demonic Blood Vein Technique and Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique still had plenty of room for improvement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo focused on the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Because according to his estimation, "By bringing down Ning Xiaoren, I will be a prominent figure for a while, the focus of the clan's discussions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"The main family won't be foolish enough to withhold my rewards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Ning Xiaohui's achievements are far inferior to mine. My chances of obtaining the Ice Jade Wine are very high!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo planned to use the Ice Jade Wine to boost his cultivation, so the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, which had no shortcuts, became his current focus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The arduous task of refining blood essence was over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a breath of turbid air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He began to ponder the current situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Today, I brought down Ning Xiaoren, becoming famous throughout the clan, widely known."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"In the coming period, I need to recruit as many branch family members as possible to formally rise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"I need to complete this quickly, the sooner the better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Once this favorable wind passes, it will be much harder to rise again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"As for the account with Ning Ze's family, it can be settled slowly in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Sun Lingtong had always taught him to repay kindness and avenge grievances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo had grown up in the Ning family and was very familiar with its dynamics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">It was precisely because he understood the conflicts between the main and branch families so well that he could easily exploit them to bring down Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Xiaoren's existence had already hindered Ning Zhuo's progress and had to be removed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo had never thought of leaving the family and rashly cooperating with outsiders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He was very clear about the value of his identity as a Ning family member.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The identity of a Ning family member helped him grow steadily and make progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">If he were not a Ning family member, Zheng Jian, Zhou Zesheng, and others would treat Ning Zhuo very differently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The pressure from Zhu Xuanji's investigation also made Ning Zhuo choose to continue hiding within the family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After obtaining the embryonic form of the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, Ning Zhuo was even more certain that his Ning family identity could not be easily discarded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Because once the Life Hanging by a Thread was planted, it could exist for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">It was very beneficial for fate energy, making Ning Zhuo understand that uniting more clan members around him was greatly advantageous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Speaking of the Life Hanging by a Thread... today I accidentally observed that many of my classmates' Life Hanging by a Threads have become thicker and more laborious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"I clearly haven't used the embryonic form of the divine ability on them again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Could it be that because I brought down Ning Xiaoren and my reputation increased, they are more inclined to follow me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">With a turn of thought, Ning Zhuo thought of another key point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Has my communication jade slip already been transferred from Chen Cha to Fei Si?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo had secretly used his relationship with Fei Si to deal with Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Fei Si had previously appreciated Ning Zhuo, and causing internal strife in the Ning family was beneficial to the City Lord's Mansion, so the possibility of Fei Si requesting the City Lord's Mansion to use their insider in the Ning family was high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">As a result, it worked!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">However, the City Lord's Mansion would not expose their key insider to Ning Zhuo because of this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">So, Ning Zhuo could only guess at the banquet which branch family member present might be the insider for the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The Ning family's main and branch families... and the City Lord's Mansion's insider..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"I didn't even need to use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal or the Life Hanging by a Thread, and I achieved this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Everyone's desires, the conflicts between groups, the rules of the righteous forces' operations, aren't they all strings?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"I just need to follow the trend to make them act as I wish."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Each action combined can shape the situation as I want."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Isn't this another level of 'following the spirit'?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo thought of how he had previously taken measures to strengthen his control over Yuan Dasheng during the Wisdom Spirit Stage by constantly aligning with his spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"The reason I succeeded this time was that I guided them according to their thoughts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Life Hanging by a Thread..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">As Ning Zhuo thought of this, a flash of inspiration appeared in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The inspiration flickered, and when Ning Zhuo subconsciously tried to grasp it, it disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Was it my illusion?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"I seemed to feel that the lotus bud of the embryonic form of the divine ability trembled slightly, as if it opened a petal?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
