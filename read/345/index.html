<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 345: Poisonous Little Boy</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The Fox God's face turned pale, her eyes twitching as she stared at the two people before her.<br/>
<br/>
One was a graceful young man in white, the other a delicate child, both looking harmless.<br/>
<br/>
But in stark contrast to their appearances, their hearts were too black, too filthy!<br/>
<br/>
"Meeting you two, I suppose it's my fate to endure this calamity," the Fox God said after a long silence, with a bitter smile and a heartbroken voice. "A Spirit Concealment Willow, one Golden Core level Spirit Concealment Willow!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes widened.<br/>
<br/>
Even Ning Zhuo couldn't hide his surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Spirit Concealment Willow!<br/>
<br/>
And a Golden Core level Spirit Concealment Willow at that?<br/>
<br/>
"Did I hear that correctly?!" Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo looked at each other in disbelief.<br/>
<br/>
The spirit willow hides its form and evades disaster, mysteries of enlightenment lie in the shadows of its leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Spirit Concealment Willows grew in auspicious places rich in spiritual energy, possessing the natural ability to hide themselves. This ability is even stronger than that of the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
The Myriad Li Wandering Dragon could only become invisible, not intangible. Even if you couldn‚Äôt see it, you could still touch it.<br/>
<br/>
The Spirit Concealment Willow could not only become invisible but also intangible. Even if you walked to where it's rooted and wandered back and forth repeatedly, you wouldn't be able to touch it.<br/>
<br/>
The hiding ability of the Spirit Concealment Willow was just a survival mechanism. Its true value lay in two aspects.<br/>
<br/>
One was evading disaster.<br/>
<br/>
It was said that the Spirit Concealment Willow could change fate and escape calamities.<br/>
<br/>
The other was enlightenment.<br/>
<br/>
When a cultivator cultivated beneath a Spirit Concealment Willow, their comprehension ability was enhanced significantly, making it twice as easy to understand cultivation methods and study various arts of cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Even a Qi Refining stage Spirit Concealment Willow would have Golden Core cultivators fighting over it.<br/>
<br/>
Yet the Fox God directly offered a Golden Core level one!<br/>
<br/>
This was too shocking.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong intended to extort and blackmail‚Äîno, out of kindness help the Fox God atone for her sins and save her life‚Äîthey had never imagined they would receive a Golden Core level Spirit Concealment Willow!<br/>
<br/>
This was an unimaginable stroke of good fortune.<br/>
<br/>
Unexpectedly, it happened in reality, to the two of them.<br/>
<br/>
"We've hit the jackpot! We've hit the jackpot!" Sun Lingtong cheered inwardly.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God stood straight, no longer speaking.<br/>
<br/>
By offering a Golden Core level Spirit Concealment Willow, she was certain the two would agree.<br/>
<br/>
This price was too high, too heavy!<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God said coldly: "This god has offered so much, how can you two assure me that you can atone for my sins?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo reached into his robe and, in front of the Fox God, took out an imperial decree.<br/>
<br/>
He unfolded the decree and read aloud: "By the grace of heaven, the monarch decrees: The Fox God of Fog Shrouded Mountain has shown loyalty and bravery, enduring humiliation for a greater cause, infiltrating the demonic monster‚Äôs bandit group, gathering intelligence, and exposing their plot."<br/>
<br/>
"For your meritorious service, you are hereby granted a title, appointed as the 'Official Mountain God of Fog Shrouded Mountain.' You are commanded to actively cooperate with members of the royal family, join forces to eradicate the bandits, protect the people's peace, and eternally enjoy the glory of worship."<br/>
<br/>
"So it is decreed!"<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God's face was solemn as she bowed: "This subject accepts the decree and thanks the monarch for this great honor!"<br/>
<br/>
As soon as she finished speaking, the decree burst with light, falling onto the Fox God and directly forming a contract.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God closed her eyes briefly, feeling the authenticity of the contract, then looked at Ning Zhuo with eyes full of amazement.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo directly producing an imperial decree was far beyond her expectations.<br/>
<br/>
She truly hadn't imagined that this young man before her had reached the ears of the monarch, accomplishing such a great feat in just these few days. Not only had he uncovered a major case, but he had also obtained an imperial decree!<br/>
<br/>
What she didn't know was that this decree came from Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was a Golden Core figurehead of the Zhu family, possessing multiple divine abilities and showing strong Nascent Soul potential, deeply trusted by the monarch.<br/>
<br/>
He often carried a blank imperial decree while investigating cases, filling in the content himself when necessary.<br/>
<br/>
The blank decree bore the seal of the Southern Bean Kingdom's monarch. As long as the content was filled in correctly, it would take effect!<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God received the decree from Ning Zhuo's hand, while Ning Zhuo obtained numerous cultivation treasures.<br/>
<br/>
With the contract formed, both parties made the exchange.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to carefully study them, especially the Golden Core level Spirit Concealment Willow. But the timing wasn't right, so he had to first put them all into the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon materialize, the Fox God sighed lightly: "A Myriad Li Wandering Dragon?"<br/>
<br/>
She immediately recognized this classical Nascent Soul level mechanical construct.<br/>
<br/>
Two Foundation Establishment cultivators possessing so many treasures. This further confirmed for her that Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo had extremely deep backgrounds, and she dared not offend them in the slightest.<br/>
<br/>
Even the pain of giving up her life savings was somewhat alleviated by this realization.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God respectfully asked how she should cooperate with their actions next.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo told her to wait here, and when the time came, to act on his orders.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God suppressed her doubts and obediently complied.<br/>
<br/>
Having completed this task, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but recall his previous conversation with Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had directly asked Zhu Xuanji: "How should we deal with that Fox God?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji thought for a moment and sighed: "It's better to use someone who has made mistakes than someone who has done good deeds."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately understood his meaning.<br/>
<br/>
The official Mountain God of Fog Shrouded Mountain was already in grave danger. If they also killed the deputy Mountain God, how would Fog Shrouded Mountain be governed and managed?<br/>
<br/>
Relying on those villagers?<br/>
<br/>
Rather than relying on human cultivators, it would be better to depend on divine beings.<br/>
<br/>
Although the Fox God had submitted to demons, she had ultimately exposed the plot and was still useful and meritorious.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, gods were far more adept at governing mountains, lakes, and such than human cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhu royal family was lacking in talent, struggling to govern the Southern Bean Kingdom. This was evident from the situation with the Floating Magnetic Prefecture Governor.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that the Southern Bean Monarch had to particularly value such an outsider showed how shallow the royal family's influence was in rural areas.<br/>
<br/>
Having leverage over the Fox God was exactly what the royal family would be most pleased to see.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's reaction was also within Ning Zhuo's expectations.<br/>
<br/>
Even back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had known Zhu Xuanji very well, aware that he was concerned about the country and prioritized the interests of the royal family in his considerations.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said: "Lord Zhu, Governor, you shouldn't act rashly to avoid alerting our targets. Let the two of us take action to force that Fox God to submit."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji looked deeply at Ning Zhuo: "If you voluntarily take on this order, your share of the spoils afterwards will be reduced."<br/>
<br/>
He was fully aware of Ning Zhuo's intentions.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he had seen too much while investigating cases.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, then agreed on the spot and asked for credentials.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji pondered briefly, then handed over the imperial decree and, to the surprise of the three other people present, personally wrote the content of the decree.<br/>
<br/>
At the foot of the mountain, a sudden burst of light appeared, dazzling to the eye.<br/>
<br/>
Then, a large number of cultivators appeared out of thin air.<br/>
<br/>
This scene immediately caught the Fox God's attention.<br/>
<br/>
"He actually mobilized an army to deal with the Black Wind Tiger Demon?"<br/>
<br/>
"Wait, this army's level isn't very high."<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God observed from afar, gradually realizing this was a local garrison.<br/>
<br/>
"The Black Wind Tiger Demon practices the Flesh and Blood Devouring Technique. No matter how many cannon fodder surround it, they'll just be its food, or moving pills," the Fox God couldn't help but remind them.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong giggled: "Fox God, just keep watching."<br/>
<br/>
The light of teleportation continued to surge.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators that appeared next were clearly much more elite. There were several Foundation Establishment level leaders, all exuding a fierce and imposing aura.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God evaluated: "If this army is well-versed in battle formations, they might have a fighting chance. But large formations are difficult to coordinate with increasing numbers. If a weakness is found and the formation is broken, the demonic tiger will slaughter indiscriminately, killing countless."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo remained silent.<br/>
<br/>
The final wave of transmission!<br/>
<br/>
As the light dissipated, Meng Zizhong, holding a long-handled war hammer, appeared in the Fox God's view.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God was stunned: "Meng Zizhong?!"<br/>
<br/>
Her breath caught, and for a moment she thought Meng Zizhong had brought the cultivator army to fell the mountain and destroy the temple, to eliminate her.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God's mind was quick, and after a moment's thought, she suddenly understood.<br/>
<br/>
At the foot of the mountain, the cultivator army began to quickly form their formation.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon received the battle report. It knew it couldn't let the human cultivators form their formation smoothly, so it immediately led all its forces to charge down the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
It wanted to take advantage of their unstable formation to defeat them first, then retreat!<br/>
<br/>
"It's about to begin!" Sun Lingtong giggled, watching the battle with great interest.<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God suddenly looked at Ning Zhuo: "Did you specifically dispatch Meng Zizhong to eliminate the Black Wind Tiger Demon?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo glanced at her, then turned his gaze to the battlefield at the foot of the mountain, saying flatly: "I just spread some rumors."<br/>
<br/>
The Fox God's eyes narrowed slightly. Ning Zhuo's calm and monotonous tone sent a chill down her spine.<br/>
<br/>
"What a poisonous scheme!" the Fox God inwardly exclaimed, her vigilance and wariness towards Ning Zhuo increasing several fold.<br/>
<br/>
The monsters charged down from the mountain!<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon charged at the forefront, its eyes blood-red, killing intent fierce, roaring like thunder: "Meng Zizhong, I'll chew you up and swallow you alive!"<br/>
<br/>
But Meng Zizhong had already achieved his goal, intercepting the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong snorted coldly, holding a long-handled war hammer, and stepped forward.<br/>
<br/>
He ran out of the military formation, directly confronting the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
<br/>
Bang!<br/>
<br/>
The two collided violently.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong retreated four steps, while the Black Wind Tiger Demon only stepped back once.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon shook its tiger paw, dissipating the numbness.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong gripped his war hammer even tighter.<br/>
<br/>
He thought to himself: "This demonic tiger is quite strong, I'm not its match. I'll attack from a distance with spells first to weaken it!"<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he thought this, earth-attribute magical power surged forth, turning into countless grains of sand, covering the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong shouted: "Sand, cover its eyes!"<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon's vision was obscured, its hearing disrupted.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong shouted again: "Stones, strike its waist!"<br/>
<br/>
Earth-attribute magical power condensed into stone balls, quickly rolling forward with a rumbling sound, crashing into the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Wind Tiger Demon closed its eyes and covered its ears, knocked back repeatedly by the stone balls, its form swaying, its lower back faintly aching.<br/>
<br/>
It roared, using a technique from its Blood and Flesh Demonic Technique ‚Äî<br/>
<br/>
Bloody Wind!<br/>
<br/>
A fierce wind arose, the smell of blood quickly spreading across the entire battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Clouds follow dragons, wind follows tigers. Tigers were naturally adept with wind, and the "wind" in the Black Wind Tiger Demon's nickname indirectly showcased its prowess in wind techniques.<br/>
<br/>
The fierce wind swept in all directions, blowing the yellow sand backwards, drastically reducing the speed of the rolling stones, many almost stopping in place, unable to roll.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Zizhong snorted coldly: "It's not over yet. Flying Sand, Moving Stones!"<br/>
<br/>
The techniques to move sand and stones were originally two separate spells, but now under Meng Zizhong's control, they merged into one, mutually reinforcing each other, greatly increasing their power.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, yellow sand flew wildly in the air and rolling stones charged forward, breaking through the bloody wind's obstruction and crashing into the Tiger Demon's body.<br/>
<br/>
Bang bang bang...<br/>
<br/>
The Tiger Demon was knocked down.<br/>
<br/>
The rolling stones immediately pressed down, piling on top of each other and pinning it to the ground.</div>
