<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 345: Poisonous Little Boy</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Fox God's face turned pale, her eyes twitching as she stared at the two people before her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">One was a graceful young man in white, the other a delicate child, both looking harmless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But in stark contrast to their appearances, their hearts were too black, too filthy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Meeting you two, I suppose it's my fate to endure this calamity," the Fox God said after a long silence, with a bitter smile and a heartbroken voice. "A Spirit Concealment Willow, one Golden Core level Spirit Concealment Willow!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Sun Lingtong's eyes widened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Even Ning Zhuo couldn't hide his surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Spirit Concealment Willow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">And a Golden Core level Spirit Concealment Willow at that?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Did I hear that correctly?!" Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo looked at each other in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The spirit willow hides its form and evades disaster, mysteries of enlightenment lie in the shadows of its leaves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Spirit Concealment Willows grew in auspicious places rich in spiritual energy, possessing the natural ability to hide themselves. This ability is even stronger than that of the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Myriad Li Wandering Dragon could only become invisible, not intangible. Even if you couldnâ€™t see it, you could still touch it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Spirit Concealment Willow could not only become invisible but also intangible. Even if you walked to where it's rooted and wandered back and forth repeatedly, you wouldn't be able to touch it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The hiding ability of the Spirit Concealment Willow was just a survival mechanism. Its true value lay in two aspects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">One was evading disaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It was said that the Spirit Concealment Willow could change fate and escape calamities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The other was enlightenment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">When a cultivator cultivated beneath a Spirit Concealment Willow, their comprehension ability was enhanced significantly, making it twice as easy to understand cultivation methods and study various arts of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Even a Qi Refining stage Spirit Concealment Willow would have Golden Core cultivators fighting over it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Yet the Fox God directly offered a Golden Core level one!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">This was too shocking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Even though Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong intended to extort and blackmailâ€”no, out of kindness help the Fox God atone for her sins and save her lifeâ€”they had never imagined they would receive a Golden Core level Spirit Concealment Willow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">This was an unimaginable stroke of good fortune.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Unexpectedly, it happened in reality, to the two of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"We've hit the jackpot! We've hit the jackpot!" Sun Lingtong cheered inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Fox God stood straight, no longer speaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">By offering a Golden Core level Spirit Concealment Willow, she was certain the two would agree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">This price was too high, too heavy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Fox God said coldly: "This god has offered so much, how can you two assure me that you can atone for my sins?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo reached into his robe and, in front of the Fox God, took out an imperial decree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He unfolded the decree and read aloud: "By the grace of heaven, the monarch decrees: The Fox God of Fog Shrouded Mountain has shown loyalty and bravery, enduring humiliation for a greater cause, infiltrating the demonic monsterâ€™s bandit group, gathering intelligence, and exposing their plot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"For your meritorious service, you are hereby granted a title, appointed as the 'Official Mountain God of Fog Shrouded Mountain.' You are commanded to actively cooperate with members of the royal family, join forces to eradicate the bandits, protect the people's peace, and eternally enjoy the glory of worship."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"So it is decreed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Fox God's face was solemn as she bowed: "This subject accepts the decree and thanks the monarch for this great honor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">As soon as she finished speaking, the decree burst with light, falling onto the Fox God and directly forming a contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Fox God closed her eyes briefly, feeling the authenticity of the contract, then looked at Ning Zhuo with eyes full of amazement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo directly producing an imperial decree was far beyond her expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">She truly hadn't imagined that this young man before her had reached the ears of the monarch, accomplishing such a great feat in just these few days. Not only had he uncovered a major case, but he had also obtained an imperial decree!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">What she didn't know was that this decree came from Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Xuanji was a Golden Core figurehead of the Zhu family, possessing multiple divine abilities and showing strong Nascent Soul potential, deeply trusted by the monarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He often carried a blank imperial decree while investigating cases, filling in the content himself when necessary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The blank decree bore the seal of the Southern Bean Kingdom's monarch. As long as the content was filled in correctly, it would take effect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Fox God received the decree from Ning Zhuo's hand, while Ning Zhuo obtained numerous cultivation treasures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">With the contract formed, both parties made the exchange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He wanted to carefully study them, especially the Golden Core level Spirit Concealment Willow. But the timing wasn't right, so he had to first put them all into the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Seeing the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon materialize, the Fox God sighed lightly: "A Myriad Li Wandering Dragon?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">She immediately recognized this classical Nascent Soul level mechanical construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Two Foundation Establishment cultivators possessing so many treasures. This further confirmed for her that Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo had extremely deep backgrounds, and she dared not offend them in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Even the pain of giving up her life savings was somewhat alleviated by this realization.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Fox God respectfully asked how she should cooperate with their actions next.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo told her to wait here, and when the time came, to act on his orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Fox God suppressed her doubts and obediently complied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Having completed this task, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but recall his previous conversation with Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo had directly asked Zhu Xuanji: "How should we deal with that Fox God?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Zhu Xuanji thought for a moment and sighed: "It's better to use someone who has made mistakes than someone who has done good deeds."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo immediately understood his meaning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The official Mountain God of Fog Shrouded Mountain was already in grave danger. If they also killed the deputy Mountain God, how would Fog Shrouded Mountain be governed and managed?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Relying on those villagers?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Rather than relying on human cultivators, it would be better to depend on divine beings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Although the Fox God had submitted to demons, she had ultimately exposed the plot and was still useful and meritorious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Moreover, gods were far more adept at governing mountains, lakes, and such than human cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Zhu royal family was lacking in talent, struggling to govern the Southern Bean Kingdom. This was evident from the situation with the Floating Magnetic Prefecture Governor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The fact that the Southern Bean Monarch had to particularly value such an outsider showed how shallow the royal family's influence was in rural areas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Having leverage over the Fox God was exactly what the royal family would be most pleased to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhu Xuanji's reaction was also within Ning Zhuo's expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Even back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had known Zhu Xuanji very well, aware that he was concerned about the country and prioritized the interests of the royal family in his considerations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo said: "Lord Zhu, Governor, you shouldn't act rashly to avoid alerting our targets. Let the two of us take action to force that Fox God to submit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhu Xuanji looked deeply at Ning Zhuo: "If you voluntarily take on this order, your share of the spoils afterwards will be reduced."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He was fully aware of Ning Zhuo's intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After all, he had seen too much while investigating cases.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, then agreed on the spot and asked for credentials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Zhu Xuanji pondered briefly, then handed over the imperial decree and, to the surprise of the three other people present, personally wrote the content of the decree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">At the foot of the mountain, a sudden burst of light appeared, dazzling to the eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Then, a large number of cultivators appeared out of thin air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">This scene immediately caught the Fox God's attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"He actually mobilized an army to deal with the Black Wind Tiger Demon?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Wait, this army's level isn't very high."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Fox God observed from afar, gradually realizing this was a local garrison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"The Black Wind Tiger Demon practices the Flesh and Blood Devouring Technique. No matter how many cannon fodder surround it, they'll just be its food, or moving pills," the Fox God couldn't help but remind them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong giggled: "Fox God, just keep watching."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The light of teleportation continued to surge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The cultivators that appeared next were clearly much more elite. There were several Foundation Establishment level leaders, all exuding a fierce and imposing aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Fox God evaluated: "If this army is well-versed in battle formations, they might have a fighting chance. But large formations are difficult to coordinate with increasing numbers. If a weakness is found and the formation is broken, the demonic tiger will slaughter indiscriminately, killing countless."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The final wave of transmission!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">As the light dissipated, Meng Zizhong, holding a long-handled war hammer, appeared in the Fox God's view.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Fox God was stunned: "Meng Zizhong?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Her breath caught, and for a moment she thought Meng Zizhong had brought the cultivator army to fell the mountain and destroy the temple, to eliminate her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Fox God's mind was quick, and after a moment's thought, she suddenly understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">At the foot of the mountain, the cultivator army began to quickly form their formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Black Wind Tiger Demon received the battle report. It knew it couldn't let the human cultivators form their formation smoothly, so it immediately led all its forces to charge down the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">It wanted to take advantage of their unstable formation to defeat them first, then retreat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"It's about to begin!" Sun Lingtong giggled, watching the battle with great interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Fox God suddenly looked at Ning Zhuo: "Did you specifically dispatch Meng Zizhong to eliminate the Black Wind Tiger Demon?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo glanced at her, then turned his gaze to the battlefield at the foot of the mountain, saying flatly: "I just spread some rumors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The Fox God's eyes narrowed slightly. Ning Zhuo's calm and monotonous tone sent a chill down her spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"What a poisonous scheme!" the Fox God inwardly exclaimed, her vigilance and wariness towards Ning Zhuo increasing several fold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The monsters charged down from the mountain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Black Wind Tiger Demon charged at the forefront, its eyes blood-red, killing intent fierce, roaring like thunder: "Meng Zizhong, I'll chew you up and swallow you alive!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">But Meng Zizhong had already achieved his goal, intercepting the Black Wind Tiger Demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Meng Zizhong snorted coldly, holding a long-handled war hammer, and stepped forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He ran out of the military formation, directly confronting the Black Wind Tiger Demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The two collided violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Meng Zizhong retreated four steps, while the Black Wind Tiger Demon only stepped back once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The Black Wind Tiger Demon shook its tiger paw, dissipating the numbness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Meng Zizhong gripped his war hammer even tighter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He thought to himself: "This demonic tiger is quite strong, I'm not its match. I'll attack from a distance with spells first to weaken it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">As soon as he thought this, earth-attribute magical power surged forth, turning into countless grains of sand, covering the Black Wind Tiger Demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Meng Zizhong shouted: "Sand, cover its eyes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Black Wind Tiger Demon's vision was obscured, its hearing disrupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Meng Zizhong shouted again: "Stones, strike its waist!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Earth-attribute magical power condensed into stone balls, quickly rolling forward with a rumbling sound, crashing into the Black Wind Tiger Demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Black Wind Tiger Demon closed its eyes and covered its ears, knocked back repeatedly by the stone balls, its form swaying, its lower back faintly aching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">It roared, using a technique from its Blood and Flesh Demonic Technique â€”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Bloody Wind!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">A fierce wind arose, the smell of blood quickly spreading across the entire battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Clouds follow dragons, wind follows tigers. Tigers were naturally adept with wind, and the "wind" in the Black Wind Tiger Demon's nickname indirectly showcased its prowess in wind techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The fierce wind swept in all directions, blowing the yellow sand backwards, drastically reducing the speed of the rolling stones, many almost stopping in place, unable to roll.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Meng Zizhong snorted coldly: "It's not over yet. Flying Sand, Moving Stones!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">The techniques to move sand and stones were originally two separate spells, but now under Meng Zizhong's control, they merged into one, mutually reinforcing each other, greatly increasing their power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In an instant, yellow sand flew wildly in the air and rolling stones charged forward, breaking through the bloody wind's obstruction and crashing into the Tiger Demon's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Bang bang bang...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Tiger Demon was knocked down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The rolling stones immediately pressed down, piling on top of each other and pinning it to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
