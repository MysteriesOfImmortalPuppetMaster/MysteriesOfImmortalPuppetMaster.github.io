<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 229: The Third Layer of Rumors</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo left the martial arts arena and returned to his residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">From his appearance, it was clear that his previous tension had vanished, replaced by a confident stride, head held high, and a vigorous spirit, with no trace of the previous oppression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He returned to his underground training room, took out the mechanical classics, and quickly became engrossed in them, focusing intently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He went to his workbench, picked up the scattered mechanical parts from the ground, and began disassembling and replacing them, continuing his research on mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He worked until lunchtime.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Pushing the door open, he went to the dining hall and ate several bowls of rice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">These dishes were quite luxurious, all being spirit food! Despite Ning Zhuo's current cultivation at the ninth layer peak, he still consumed a large amount of spirit food daily as a disguise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">After a hearty meal, Ning Zhuo returned to the underground training chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">This time, he activated the Floating Cloud Cloak, enveloping himself in layers of floating clouds, pretending to cultivate the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Cloud Concealment Bud under his tongue, infused with Ning Zhuo's mana, helped him disguise himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In the perception of Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan, Ning Zhuo appeared to be cultivating the fourth layer of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">After finishing his meditation, Ning Zhuo rested briefly, then closed his eyes within the floating clouds and directly entered the Immortal Palace with his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"You're here!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been silently observing Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Seeing Ning Zhuo enter the Immortal Palace again, it silently cheered for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit never imagined that one day it would secretly support Ning Zhuo, wishing he could pass the Dao Gate path in one go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit?" Ning Zhuo called out tentatively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shrank back, hearing him but not wanting to respond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">It tried to avoid communicating with Ning Zhuo as much as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Reflecting on their last conversation, it felt it had said too much, really too much!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Having learned from his previous failure in exploring the Dao Gate path, Ning Zhuo chose spirit stones as rewards from the start this time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He had already claimed the rewards from the leaderboard once, and the next claim was four days away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">But relying solely on the spirit stones from passing the stages, he had accumulated quite a number.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">When Ning Zhuo reached the final stage of the Dao Gate path again, his spirit power reserves were at least thirty percent higher than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Yet, he failed once more. "My spell proficiency still needs improvement... but this requires extensive practice and can't be rushed. If I have more spirit stones, I can still use the method of passing the stages by quantity!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo discovered the method to pass the stages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Either refine spell techniques or summarize experiences, with a comprehensive and detailed strategy, calculating every step meticulously to accumulate a quantitative advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">While Ning Zhuo was breaking through the stages, Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan kept a close watch on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"This Floating Cloud Cloak is somewhat troublesome," Ning Jiufan remarked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Most of his detection spells couldn't perfectly bypass the Floating Cloud Cloak, always causing significant consumption of the floating clouds. "This should be an inheritance from Ning Zhuo's mother. The techniques from the Flying Cloud Kingdom indeed differ greatly from those of our Southern Bean Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The layers of floating clouds enveloping Ning Zhuo made Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan less inclined to observe him closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Zhu Xuanji continued, "It seems Ning Zhuo has completely calmed down. His temperament has undergone a transformation, which is very good. He has withstood this test, proving to be a good seedling for cultivation. Brother Ning, I must congratulate you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Jiufan smiled slightly, genuinely pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He had witnessed Ning Zhuo's performance over the past couple of days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The latter had indeed made significant progress in temperament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Coupled with Ning Zhuo's innate talent, he was destined to become a pillar of the Ning family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Who's there?" Suddenly, Zhu Xuanji shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">His eyes shone brightly, emitting golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In an instant, his gaze was so sharp that Ning Jiufan had to avert his eyes to avoid direct contact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zhu Xuanji disappeared instantly, leaving only a faint golden shadow in Ning Jiufan's vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Boom! The next moment, Ning Jiufan heard a violent explosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He quickly turned his head and saw Zhu Xuanji fiercely clashing with a mysterious strong enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Jiufan hurriedly intervened, rushing over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhu Xuanji waved his hand, and a golden light wall appeared out of thin air, enveloping Ning Zhuo, giving an impression of being impregnable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The mysterious enemy, wrapped in green spell light, was rapidly retreating. "Where do you think you're going!" Zhu Xuanji pursued relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The green spell light was shattered by him, revealing the enemy's appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">She had a graceful figure and a face like a peach blossom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Void Sect, Yang Chanyu!" Instantly, the identity of the mysterious enemy flashed in Ning Jiufan's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Yang Chanyu, while retreating rapidly, smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Her eyes emitted green light, staring intently at Ning Zhuo, who was still in the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Clearly, this was a detection spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The green light retracted, and Yang Chanyu smiled lightly, "I see." After saying this, she turned, her speed increasing, leaving only a pink afterimage as she disappeared into the shadows of the street. "I'll chase! You stay here," Zhu Xuanji said, then hurriedly pursued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Jiufan concealed himself, coming directly to Ning Zhuo's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He pushed his mana to the limit but restrained his aura, not leaking a trace, standing ready.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Hearing the commotion, the Foundation Establishment guards also rushed over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">They were astonished by the golden light wall's presence, unaware of Ning Jiufan's invisible presence nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhu Xuanji and Yang Chanyu continued their chase and battle, causing explosions and the collapse of buildings, echoing like thunder throughout the night, alarming the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo's soul was still in the Lava Immortal Palace, his body surrounded by the golden light wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Outside the light wall, Foundation Establishment guards stood in heavy defense, tightly protecting him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After the disturbance, the floating clouds returned to their place, shielding Ning Zhuo securely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">However, the previous display showed that such defense was extremely fragile against a Golden Core Stage opponent, almost like a decoration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">In a certain restaurant, the continuous explosions drew the attention of the diners, who got up and went to the windows to watch the commotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Taking this opportunity, Sun Lingtong, disguised as a middle-aged man, flashed and disappeared under the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The secret monitors only had their view blocked for a moment, and when they looked again, the target had completely vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Where is he?" Feeling something was wrong, the monitors immediately ran to the scene, looking around Sun Lingtong's previous dining table, searching anxiously. "Find him quickly! He can't be far. He must be nearby!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Who is so inconsiderate?" "Using detection spells on me!" The pursuers looked grim, some directly activating detection spells, scanning all the diners on the floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Some diners immediately turned hostile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Such detection spells were quite strong and were a severe offense to those being scanned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But the next moment, the spellcasters released their auras, each showing a fierce expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">There were six of them, each with Foundation Establishment cultivation! Their combined auras immediately suppressed the entire scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The diners who had wanted to retaliate turned pale, sweating profusely, and dared not speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">This display made them realize they had offended ruthless individuals, likely from a force they couldn't provoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The pursuers searched frantically, quickly expanding their search to the entire restaurant, but they still couldn't find Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">They hurriedly left the restaurant, spreading out around it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Along the way, Sun Lingtong, disguised as an old man, brushed past the pursuers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The pursuers didn't pay attention, directly knocking Sun Lingtong to the ground, rushing forward without stopping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong immediately made groaning sounds, perfectly portraying a helpless old man knocked down by careless passersby, unable to get up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong, from the Void Sect, was adept at disguising himself as various characters! The subsequent pursuers only glanced at him before stepping over him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Each pursuer held a magical artifact, continuously infusing it with mana, causing the artifacts to emit strong fluctuations, searching the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Sun Lingtong was within the search range, even at the center, but he remained motionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">As a disciple of the Void Sect, he had the confidence to resist most detection artifacts! However, a shadow loomed in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">After spreading the second layer of rumors, Sun Lingtong found that a large number of people were searching everywhere, trying to find the source of the rumors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Sun Lingtong's detection revealed that these investigators mainly came from the four major forces of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">But it didn't stop there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">For instance, the Great Purity Palace also sent disciples to participate in the investigation. "The next moment is crucial," Sun Lingtong thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Now, all the major forces in the city were taking action, frantically searching for the mastermind behind the rumors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This made spreading rumors increasingly difficult, reducing his operational space by a hundredfold! If Sun Lingtong continued, the risk would increase tenfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">But he still held the third wave of rumors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">At this moment, Sun Lingtong, disguised as an old man, lay helplessly on the street.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He looked up at the sky, recalling his conspiracy with Ning Zhuo in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo had solemnly told him, "Brother Sun, according to my plan, the third wave of rumors is the most crucial."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
