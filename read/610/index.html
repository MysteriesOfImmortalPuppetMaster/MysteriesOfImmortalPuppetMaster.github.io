<paragraph index="1">What a strange sensation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Once Qing Chi had fully grasped her military spirit, she was able to access her faction’s military intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">And with that control came knowledge - of three distinct paths to forge her troop type.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“The first, Paper Money Spirit Envoys, requires one hundred thousand jin of century-aged green sandalwood pulp, mixed with cinnabar from Chenzhou to craft spirit coins of a green-purple hue. As the coins are burned, nine hundred jin of sunken agarwood from the South Sea must be burned alongside to temper the divine sea. Finally, endless yin energy must be infused into the body for twenty-seven days straight to complete the process.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“The second, Yin Sigil Bane Wardens, requires three thousand jin of magnetic thundersteel, paired with multicolored gallstones from Mount Taihang. Then, eight hundred strands of military balefire must be bound to the material, and finally one must enter closed-door cultivation for three days and nights.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“The third, Ghost Wail Gatebreakers, begins by drawing a Gate-Sealing Formation and gathering over ten thousand ghost spirits. These are arrayed into a Ten Thousand Ghosts Submit array. Then, oil must be refined from three millennium-old corpses to coat the emerging troops. They are cast into a surge of yin energy, where they must devour endless yin until the corpse oil transforms entirely into corpse wax. Only then can they be withdrawn and considered complete.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">When Qing Chi learned the actual costs, she stood frozen in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The price was staggering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">As a ghostman girl, she understood very well - selling herself and the entire Qing family still might not raise enough resources to afford any of these.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">She reported the details to Qing Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">His face visibly paled as he tried to offer comfort. “Don’t panic, girl. We were never going to accomplish this on our own.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“We’ll ask the City Lord for aid.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“If we succeed in raising this army, it will bring enormous benefits to White Paper Immortal City. They’ll want to support us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“In fact,” Qing Yan added, “given the current state of things, this might be the perfect time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He saw the situation clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">So Li Xiangshang and Qing Chi submitted a report together - and as expected, it caught the city’s attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">A projection of the City Lord personally handled the matter. But upon hearing the costs involved, she simply said, “That’s all?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">White Paper Immortal City had attempted to form a military many times in the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">But time and again, they had failed at the very first hurdle: condensing a military spirit. Without that, everything else was empty talk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Now, Qing Chi hadn’t just formed a military spirit - she’d advanced all the way to the troop-forging phase.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The City Lord’s projection turned to Li Xiangshang and said with genuine admiration, “Your low-tier innate talent really is useful. It doesn’t just lower the threshold for forming a military spirit - it even reduces the resource cost of raising troops. This has cut at least thirty percent off, hasn’t it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Qing Chi turned her head sharply to look at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Only now did the naive ghostman girl realize - the costs she’d just seen had already been reduced by a full thirty percent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Li Xiangshang looked back at her and said calmly, “My talent isn’t the key here. The real reason this succeeded is you, Miss Qing Chi. Not just anyone can condense a military spirit - it takes the sincere support of many.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The City Lord’s projection nodded slightly, agreeing with his assessment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">She fell silent for a moment, then spoke again. “As for the cost of forging these troops, White Paper Immortal City can shoulder it. However...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">She paused and changed her tone, raising a condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">It was simple, and very direct: the resulting troop type could be kept in Qing Chi’s care, but from that moment on, it would belong to White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Li Xiangshang looked to Qing Chi. These troops weren’t his, so it wasn’t his place to decide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Qing Chi hesitated. She didn’t like the idea. After everything she’d gone through to forge this path, why should the result belong to someone else?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The City Lord’s projection saw the hesitation and said coolly, “In the past, we’ve made many attempts to raise an army. Most failed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“And forming a military spirit? We’ve actually succeeded at that more than once.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“But forming a military unit involves many steps, and the process is time-limited. The most regrettable attempt pushed all the way to the final stage - only to fail for lack of time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Compared to the efforts of previous generations in White Paper Immortal City, your attempt this time is far more reckless.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Your only advantage lies in Young Friend Li’s innate talent.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Can you even supply a tenth of the resources needed to raise this troop? Without resources, failure is inevitable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“And even with resources, success isn’t guaranteed. If it fails, White Paper Immortal City alone will have to swallow the staggering loss.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Even if you do succeed, to be frank... this new army might not change anything for White Paper Immortal City in the grand scheme.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Every word from the City Lord was reasoned and precise, leaving Qing Chi speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">As for Li Xiangshang - he was a pure ascetic cultivator, awkward with words. At this moment, he could only stand by in silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Qing Chi furrowed her brow and said heavily, “City Lord, I can’t make this decision alone. I’d like to go back and discuss it with my father.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The City Lord nodded with a smile. “Go.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">On one hand, even if the troop’s ownership were agreed upon, Qing Chi would still be needed to lead it for quite some time. On the other, the City Lord had full confidence that Qing Chi would eventually agree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Oh, one more thing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“If our city is to provide the resources, then the troop type must be set as Ghost Wail Gatebreakers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">So not only would the troop be claimed by White Paper Immortal City, even the type had to be decided in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Qing Chi kept her head down on the way back, silent all the while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The weight of that silence became too much for Li Xiangshang, who finally spoke to comfort her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Qing Chi said, “Yeah, handing the troop over to someone else does feel pretty awful - but I trust the White Paper City Lord won’t treat us unfairly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“But what I just heard... even if we pass this troop-forging stage, there are still many hurdles ahead. In the end, we might still fail to raise an army.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“If that happens, do you think I could still use this condition... to take Jiao Ma back?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Li Xiangshang: …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He hadn’t expected that to be what was weighing on her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">But thinking it over, it actually made perfect sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The demon cultivator sighed deeply. “Then let me give you another piece of bad news. Ever since we started raising this army, I’ve been sustaining my innate gift continuously. But I won’t be able to keep it up much longer - at most, I’ve got half a month left before I have to stop.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“And once I do, failure is almost certain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Qing Chi was shocked. “Ah? How can that be?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“I told you before,” Li Xiangshang said, spreading his hands with a faintly guilty look, “this is just a temporary army we’re building. Fortunately, even if we don’t finish, this temporary force can still execute battle formations - it just won’t be nearly as effective as a true formal army.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">But Qing Chi shook her head. “That’s not what I meant. I want to know - just how much have you sacrificed to maintain your innate gift? If the price is too high, we should stop right now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“It’s true I want to win Jiao Ma back. That’s from the bottom of my heart - it’s my personal desire.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“But I don’t want to see my friends or family suffer or be harmed because of my selfishness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Li Xiangshang burst out laughing. “You silly girl.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">A warm current surged through his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He offered sincere advice. “My gift can only last for a short while - that’s something the City Lord doesn’t know. So I’d advise you: take the win while you can. Let White Paper Immortal City take the reins.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Use this chance to be honest with the City Lord. Do your best to get her to release that brat from the Jiao clan first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Qing Chi shook her head, voice uncertain. “Can I even bring it up? I don’t really dare. Wouldn’t that be like stealing the City Lord’s man? Jiao Ma’s so outstanding - I doubt she’d let him go easily!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Li Xiangshang: …</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After thinking for a moment, he said, “This kind of request - you should bring it up boldly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“We already reported the matter of morale. By now, the City Lord has definitely looked into you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“She must know you and Jiao Ma are close - and that you’ve pledged yourselves to each other.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Right now, during the troop negotiations, you’ve got a prime opportunity. If you ask, I think there’s a good chance she’ll agree.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Qing Chi’s eyes lit up. “Really?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">But then she shook her head again. “It’s a big deal. I’m worried that if I take Jiao Ma away, the City Lord might retaliate against my clan. I’d better talk to my father first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">As they talked, the two used spiritual sense to keep their voices hidden. But when they returned to their temporary lodgings in the city, they were told that Jiao Ma was already inside, paying a visit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Qing Chi instantly brightened, all her worries thrown aside. She hurried forward and stepped through the door. “What? Little Ma came on his own? Where is he - take me to him!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But Li Xiangshang’s expression darkened. “That’s not good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He reached out and stopped her. Qing Chi turned back, confused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Li Xiangshang sighed. “The City Lord’s tactics really are sharp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“She knows how much that Jiao brat affects you, so she sent him to talk you into agreeing to the deal.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Qing Chi asked, “Is that really it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Li Xiangshang nodded firmly. “Very likely!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">A moment later - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo) shook his head. “I came purely out of my own selfish reasons.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Qing Chi’s face immediately lit up. “Little Ma, you came just to see me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo nodded. “I did.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“You’re trying to raise a military unit, but that comes at a steep cost.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“If you’re seeking White Paper Immortal City’s support, you may well end up at their mercy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Tell me what you need. Maybe I can help.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Qing Chi shook her head with a sigh. “Little Ma, you don’t know how horrifying the cost of troop cultivation really is - it’s enough to scare someone senseless.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">She laid it all out: the full cost, and the terms the City Lord had offered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Qing Yan nodded. He didn’t look especially surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Raising a troop is beyond what we can do on our own.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“Handing it over to White Paper Immortal City is basically inevitable. If I were the City Lord, I’d demand the same.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“After all, we’re just ghostmen - not even human, and definitely not among her trusted followers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“If we ended up commanding our own army, then down the line, the Ghostly Black Marshlands would have a second voice.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Li Xiangshang’s eyes widened in realization. “So that’s what it means.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He was just a reclusive cultivator, not a fool - and this journey had opened his eyes many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“A second voice? What do you mean?” Qing Chi looked puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Qing Yan gave a brief explanation, and Qing Chi quickly waved her hands. “But we’re citizens of White Paper Immortal City! Our village only survives thanks to the city’s protection - we’d never go against the City Lord!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“You never know,” Li Xiangshang thought to himself. Almost reflexively, his eyes drifted to Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo), who sat quietly to the side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Qing Yan frowned slightly and gritted his teeth. “Handing the military unit over to White Paper Immortal City - we can accept that. But the troop type they’ve chosen isn’t right. We’d be better off with the Yin Sigil Bane Wardens.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Qing Chi gave a surprised “Ah?” To her, any of the three troop types seemed fine - she hadn’t expected Qing Yan to fixate on what felt like a minor detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">With a sigh, Qing Yan explained to his daughter, “The Ghost Wail Gatebreakers work by embedding arrays into the soldiers’ bodies to seal all kinds of ghost creatures within them. It’s like locking them in solitary confinement.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“On one hand, this can be used in battle to temporarily imprison troublesome ghost entities. On the other, soldiers can use formations and training techniques to tame the ghosts and form spirit contracts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“If we choose this type, White Paper Immortal City could end up with double or even triple the troop numbers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“Over the years, the city has accumulated far too many captive ghost creatures.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“But raising those ghosts takes immense resources. Maintaining a force of Ghost Wail Gatebreakers costs dozens of times more than the other two options!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“That would leave us even more at their mercy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“And there’s one more thing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Sealing a ghost into your own body - it’s an awful feeling. Sure, we ghostmen carry thick yin energy and are better suited than human cultivators for this kind of task.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“But a ghost is still a foreign entity. Cultivating with one constantly beside you is difficult and painful. Our ghostman elders would suffer greatly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Hearing this, Qing Chi decisively shook her head. “Then we won’t choose that path.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Her expression turned firm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The cultivators around her were all kin of the Qing Clan - some were uncles, others cousins. They had supported Qing Chi and helped rally the foundation of the army’s morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">As a ghostman girl, the last thing she wanted was to see her elders suffer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Li Xiangshang said, “If we’re not picking the Ghost Wail Gatebreakers, that leaves the other two.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Qing Yan nodded. “We’ll choose the Yin Sigil Bane Wardens.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“We already have Burden-Bearing Tactics. Going this route will save us resources in the long run. We can sustain the army through war itself - it has the lowest upkeep.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">“Each soldier will carry suppressive energy, making them highly effective against ghosts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">“Even if the army fails to come together in the end, the suppressive force will still remain. That, at least, is something we can give to our kin.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">“On top of that, this choice takes the least time - just three days and nights of cultivation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Qing Chi nodded. “Alright, then we’ll go with that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“Ahem, ahem, ahem.” Ning Zhuo gave three deliberate coughs, then cut in. “No. We should pick the Paper Money Spirit Envoys.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Qing Chi looked at him. “Little Ma, do you have a reason?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo turned to Qing Yan. “I was about to explain earlier, but got interrupted. I’ve come to help fund the creation of our new army.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">“One of my conditions is that we must choose the Paper Money Spirit Envoys.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Li Xiangshang frowned. “But that unit takes the longest - twenty-seven days. It uses the most resources, and its combat power is the weakest of the three. The only notable trait is that it allows all troops to move freely between the realms of yin and yang - it’s more versatile, sure, but...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Qing Yan also scowled deeply, staring at Ning Zhuo. “Our enemy is Forgetful River Prefecture Lord Meng. Are we really forming a unit like this to march into the underworld and assault the enemy’s home territory?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">“That’s suicide!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo opened his mouth to explain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Qing Chi cut in first. “Alright, Little Ma - I’ll go with your choice!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Everyone: ...</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
