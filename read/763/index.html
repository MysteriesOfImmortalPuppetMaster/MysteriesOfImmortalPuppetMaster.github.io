<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">At the edge of the cliff stood a gnarled ancient pine, a perfect spot to pause and rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ban Jie, accompanied by several maids, descended in a mechanical flying contraption and landed beneath the pine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The pine's roots coiled through the rock crevices, its branches reaching skyward like spears, its verdant canopy resembling a cloud that filtered golden sunlight into dappled patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ban Jie had come here specifically, shedding her usual opulent attire for a simple, moon-white robe draped with a translucent sharkskin gauze of the same hue, giving her an air of serene leisure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The mountain wind billowed her wide sleeves, making her appear as if she might take flight on the breeze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Gazing into the distance, Ban Jie saw a vast sea of clouds stretching endlessly, surging like waves. At times, they coalesced into snow-capped peaks, while at others, they scattered like feathers. Sunlight poured over them, creating a shimmering, molten-gold and shattered-jade luster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ban Jie's face lit up with delight. "Such a beautiful view - perfect for enjoying tea. Set up the tea service."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Her maids responded in unison with soft, obedient voices.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Working in perfect coordination, they swiftly arranged a meditation cushion, tea table, tea set, and incense burner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ban Jie settled cross-legged on the cushion, the ancient pine's canopy sheltering her overhead, while before her stretched the steaming sea of clouds, bathed in golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">She took a deep breath and began lighting the incense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Her movements were slow and deliberate, seemingly leisurely, but her mind was elsewhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">I wonder how Ban Ji is faring right now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"I came here specifically to be near Profound Armor Cave. That way, I can react swiftly and correctly to any news."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ban Jie lit the incense, watching the smoke curl upward in wisps as she waited for the latest updates. As she waited, her thoughts drifted back to a scene from before her departure, replaying vividly in her divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The Supreme Elder of the Ban Clan had summoned her to a private chamber for a solitary meeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">His face solemn, he gazed intently at Ban Jie and stated bluntly, "Your mission at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main gate is to secretly assist Ban Ji in successfully activating his Royal Mandate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Understood," Ban Jie replied, her eyes gleaming with determination and fighting spirit. She had already learned of this mission before arriving. "I will spare no effort and use every means necessary for the clan. I would even sacrifice myself to achieve this goal!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Supreme Elder's expression softened slightly. "Good, Ban Jie. You are a fine child."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"However, there is a more crucial matter I must entrust to you. You must not overexert yourself. Excessiveness can be as harmful as negligence, potentially endangering Ban Ji and our entire clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ban Jie's face immediately showed confusion, and she eagerly sought clarification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Supreme Elder sighed softly. "Activating the Royal Mandate is a complex matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"You must help Ban Ji, but not excessively. He needs to endure trials, even setbacks, for these are the flint that sparks the Royal Mandate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Only through the hammer blows of fate can the Royal Mandate be ignited, entering its burning state."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Consider the Wild Phoenix Tree, Crystal Sand Willow, Longevity Butterfly Salamander, Blade Wolf, and others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Hearing these four examples from the Supreme Elder of the Ban Clan, Ban Jie suddenly understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Wild Phoenix Tree is a tree that accidentally absorbed phoenix blood, or whose seed inherently carried dormant phoenix lineage. After enduring a great fire that burned away its old form, it awakened the regenerative power within its bloodline. Thus, it shed its former appearance, reshaped itself anew, and elevated its entire life essence, akin to a carp leaping over the Dragon Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Crystal Sand Willow is a unique variant of the sand willow. Countless sand willows gradually fell in harsh environments ravaged by sandstorms, drought, and shifting sands. Only the most resilient, those that endured to the end, developed the ability to rapidly grow new adventitious roots from their nodes while their stems pushed upward through the sand layers to form new plants. Their roots burrowed deeper, their root systems became more developed, and eventually, their root networks could even stabilize entire deserts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Longevity Butterfly Salamanders are those Butterfly Salamanders that have repeatedly severed their tails to survive calamities. Through this constant cycle of regeneration, they develop enhanced regenerative abilities, capable of precisely restoring bones, muscles, skin, and even reconstructing more complex bodily structures. With each severance and regrowth, the salamander's entire being is tempered and amplified, ultimately breaking free from its fate and extending its lifespan to tens of thousands of years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Blade Wolves are equally peculiar. This wolf species isn't naturally occurring but was deliberately bred by cultivators skilled in the Beast Taming Art. Fiercely combative, Blade Wolves originally had short lifespans, as if destined to burn themselves out from birth, constantly rushing into battle. Before dying of old age, they would devour fragments of blades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">These fragments would lacerate their mouths, tongues, throats, and even their digestive tracts, causing many Blade Wolves to cough up blood and perish. However, a small fraction endured this brutal trial, ultimately absorbing the blades into their bodies and undergoing a Body Transformation, gaining immense power and extending their lives!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Supreme Elder of the Ban Clan emphasized the crucial point to Ban Jie: "Assisting the Royal Mandate is a complex matter. You must be extremely careful with the degree of intervention. Do not shield it from all adversity. Without trials, life cannot blossom into its most brilliant form, and the Royal Mandate will never be truly awakened!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">But if the assistance provided was too meager, and Ban Ji suffered excessive losses to his Royal Mandate, the situation would be even worse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Striking the right balance was crucial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ban Jie understood now. "No wonder the clan has always offered Ban Ji only limited support. For instance, they only began divining the outcomes of this year's Myriad Phenomena Sect's Soaring Cloud Assembly a few years ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Even though the precious materials required for the divination had long been stored in the clan's treasury."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This meant that while the Ban Clan had calculated various opportunities suitable for Ban Ji - such as the Azure Reed Seed, Cart Spider Seed, Blind Foolish Old Man, and Profound Armor Cave - they had left him with only a few short years to prepare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"You've only grasped part of the truth," the Supreme Elder of the Ban Clan said, shaking his head and continuing to guide her. "Divination is an exceedingly delicate art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Among the hundred arts of cultivation, divination is the most mysterious, without equal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"On the surface, this technique appears to predict the future, allowing cultivators to make adjustments in the present. But in reality, it's a challenge to fate itself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Every living being possesses a Fate Attribute, a destiny ordained by the heavens. When cultivators repeatedly alter the future through divination, they inevitably begin to deviate from the path ordained by the heavens."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"For individual cultivators, this is a great advantage. But Heaven will not allow it. If everyone were to do this, all living beings would escape the constraints of their Fate Attributes, plunging the world into chaos. In endless turmoil, they would slaughter each other, rapidly leading to decline and destruction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Therefore, divination techniques have always been difficult to master, and most people struggle to acquire them. This is Heaven's subtle but constant interference, working to maintain stability throughout the Cultivation World."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After a pause, the Supreme Elder of the Ban Clan continued, "Our clan possesses the Clan Destiny Nexus Chain, a priceless artifact capable of detecting Fortune, managing the Qi Luck of our members, and performing divination for each clansman. It is the cornerstone of our clan's power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Decades ago, our clan received guidance from the Reclusive Immortal Dunjia, a monumental opportunity for our entire lineage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Combining these two factors allowed us to link Ban Ji to the Royal Mandate and manipulate his destiny to a certain extent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Although the Reclusive Immortal Dunjia left behind a wealth of precious materials, he specifically cautioned that Ban Ji's divination was of critical importance and should be delayed rather than rushed. Do you understand why?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Supreme Elder of the Ban Clan tested Ban Jie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ban Jie frowned deeply, her mind sharp. After a moment's reflection, she realized the Supreme Elder of the Ban Clan had already revealed the answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">She replied, "Since Heaven conceals the art of divination and prevents cultivators from inheriting it, it would naturally suppress and reshape any cultivator who uses divination to foresee the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"In Ban Ji's case, Heaven's attention is undoubtedly extremely high."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"If our clan were to divine the future in advance, that future would likely be altered by Heaven's intervention. This would not only waste our precious divination materials but also cause us to invest our efforts and time in the wrong direction, falsely believing we had made adequate preparations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Supreme Elder stroked his beard, a hint of satisfaction in his eyes. "A promising child indeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Ban Ji carries the Royal Mandate. According to Heaven's ordained path for him, he will walk alone, straying onto the Demonic Path. His conflicts with the clan will escalate step by step, ultimately turning them into bitter enemies. Through these trials, he will activate the Royal Mandate and become the new king."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Our Ban Clan will serve as fuel for his royal path, providing him with the opportunity to solidify his demonic heart and purge his weaknesses."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ban Jie immediately felt a heavy pressure from the Supreme Elder's solemn tone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Ban Clan sought to leverage the Royal Mandate for greater advancement. At the same time, they feared that Ban Ji's unchecked growth could endanger the entire clan. Combining these concerns, the clan had mobilized its full resources to execute a daring plan: tightly linking the clan's fortune to Ban Ji's fate, ensuring mutual prosperity or destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This was both self-preservation and self-strengthening, a perilous gamble with immense potential rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Supreme Elder then asked Ban Jie, "Do you know why we've chosen you to assist Ban Ji?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Before Ban Jie could answer, the Supreme Elder revealed the reason: "You grew up together, like childhood sweethearts. Firstly, your intimate knowledge of his temperament and character will allow you to support him effectively without provoking his resentment or aversion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Secondly, your fortunes are more closely intertwined with his, making you better suited to help him activate the Royal Mandate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"You are the perfect candidate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Remember, the fate of our clan rests on your shoulders."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ban Jie took a deep breath, her heart swelling with a sense of duty and honor. "Rest assured, my lord," she said, "I understand. I will devote all my energy to providing Ban Ji with the most suitable support."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">She now fully grasped the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">To help Ban Ji activate the Royal Mandate, her opponents weren't just Ning Zhuo, the Human Tribulation, but also Heaven itself, and even Ban Ji himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">A sudden gust of wind swept through the cliffside, scattering the incense smoke rising from the ground before her and interrupting Ban Jie's reverie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">As she arranged the tea set, Ban Jie analyzed the current situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Our clan had divined this years in advance, preparing renowned Martial Artists to help Ban Ji enhance his close-combat skills with blades and swords."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Yet upon entering the Profound Armor Cave, Ban Ji never even touched a single blade or sword."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"The cave's Grand Formation randomly distributes Profound Armament Armor to all participating cultivators. This fairness, disrupted by Heaven's interference, rendered our clan's meticulous preparations for Ban Ji utterly futile."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Upon learning this, Ban Jie immediately dispatched agents to implement countermeasures, successfully bribing the Void.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"However, even with this intervention, Ban Ji only managed to obtain a Bronze Blade. In the subsequent Bronze Sword duel, he was completely outmatched, failing to secure a single victory."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ban Jie now knew that Ban Ji's opponents wielding swords and sabers possessed significantly greater combat prowess than others at their level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ban Ji's poor performance was partly due to this. Another factor was the excessive energy he had expended in previous battles. Unlike Ning Zhuo, whose physical body was exceptionally robust, Ban Ji had cultivated the Greedy Mechanism Demonic Heart Art, which focused solely on refining the Upper Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Even with the countermeasures I've deployed, Heaven's intervention continues to suppress Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The third trial commenced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Though Ban Jie wasn't physically present, her operatives had already relayed multiple intelligence reports, giving her a clear understanding of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">With these thoughts in mind, Ban Jie meticulously arranged the tea tray, teapot, fairness cup, tasting cups, aroma cups, tea scoop, tea caddy, tea spoon, and other utensils on the table before her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Gazing at these tea implements, she seemed to visualize the battle unfolding in the cavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The three Golden Core cultivators are locked in a fierce struggle. They won't withdraw easily until a victor emerges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Lu Zeng is likely to be eliminated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Foundation Establishment cultivators are too fragmented to unite, and it's not the time for them to do so. This is the perfect opportunity to probe Ning Zhuo and weaken him as much as possible!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">With this plan in mind, Ban Jie launched her second wave of forces, instructing Zhang Wangxing and other familiar faces to stage a public display. The goal was to lull Ning Zhuo into a false sense of security, creating an opening for a decisive strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Zhang Wangxing's face twisted into a ferocious mask, his eyes burning with murderous intent - a stark contrast to his earlier, pitiful pleas for help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He hurled a bronze chain directly at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">But Ning Zhuo was no longer the same man. He retreated swiftly, his movements fluid and elusive, dodging the chain with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Yet the other attackers had already moved in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">A heavy bronze mountain-splitting axe, carried by a gale of malevolent wind, swept horizontally at Ning Zhuo's waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">A bronze sword and a water-parting dagger struck from behind, one aimed at his vital point between the shoulder blades, the other at his kidney.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Three bronze flying shuttles pierced the air silently, targeting Ning Zhuo's upper, middle, and lower vital points, sealing off all avenues of escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Clearly, these cultivators had practiced their coordination. Their attacks synchronized perfectly, each strike complementing the others with seamless synergy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo suddenly found himself trapped in a coordinated assault, the situation deteriorating rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">A cold glint flashed in his eyes. After a moment of shock and fury, his composure turned icy, like snow and frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He retreated steadily, his body trembling slightly as several pieces of Profound Armament Armor flew from his sleeves and other hidden pockets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The armor transformed in mid-air, morphing into a bronze spear, a bronze blade, a bronze sword, and a pair of bronze gauntlets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Clang! Clang! Clang...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">A shower of sparks erupted as Ning Zhuo's bronze weapon precisely parried the Profound Armament Armor's attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">However, this brief delay severely hampered Ning Zhuo's retreat, allowing the cultivators to surround him from all sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"You..." The outsiders who had been deceived into attacking Zhang Wangxing now wore expressions of shock and suspicion, freezing in place, unsure of what to do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Meanwhile, the second wave of attacks against Ning Zhuo began anew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">A barrage of weapons rained down upon him. Ning Zhuo parried left and right, completely on the defensive.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
