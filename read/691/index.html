<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Su Lingkou couldn't understand. She was deeply puzzled. "Cousin and Lin Jinglong were competing for the second position - a serious matter for both sides, with each taking it very seriously."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"How could Ning Zhuo's intervention turn it into a game of rock-paper-scissors? How could such a trivial matter decide the outcome?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Why had Shen Xi agreed?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Because in that instant, he had suddenly realized the situation had completely changed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He had initially believed that Ning Zhuo would form an alliance with him, supporting each other, and that at least this time, Ning Zhuo would be his key ally. But Ning Zhuo's actions had never followed his planned course.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo had directly approached Lin Jinglong, successfully hosted a banquet, and judging by the atmosphere, they might have already reached a private agreement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">In this situation, if Shen Xi maintained a rigid stance and insisted on claiming the second position, he risked provoking a joint attack from Ning Zhuo and Lin Jinglong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Therefore, he had seized the opportunity to concede, taking a step back to preserve his maneuvering space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">There was no need for a direct confrontation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Even if he lost the second position, it would only be a minor setback, far from a crippling blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo didn't just offer a casual greeting; he stood up and personally welcomed Shen Xi and Su Lingkou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Seeing this, Yu Heye immediately rose as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Lin Jinglong, born into a prominent clan, naturally possessed an air of dignity and rose almost simultaneously with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Yet Yu Heye's actions still sent a slight tremor through Lin Jinglong's heart, prompting him to subtly raise his assessment of Ning Zhuo by another level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo had arranged for Shen Xi and Su Lingkou to sit to Yu Heye's left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This seating arrangement was quite intriguing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yu Heye occupied the head seat, with Shen Xi to his left and Lin Jinglong to his right. Su Lingkou sat beside Shen Xi, while Ning Zhuo sat beside Lin Jinglong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Based solely on the seating arrangement, Ning Zhuo's status appeared to be on par with Su Lingkou's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">As for Gongsun Yan, he stood behind Ning Zhuo and Lin Jinglong, not taking a seat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Yu Heye gestured to the delicacies on the table, introducing them and initiating conversation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Following this opening, the group exchanged pleasantries and toasted each other for several rounds before finally addressing the matter at hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">When Ning Zhuo clearly stated his intentions, Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong were visibly astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Su Lingkou, thinking she had misheard, asked Ning Zhuo again, "What? You're not participating in the rock-paper-scissors game?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo smiled. "I was recommended by Brother Shen. How could I presume to surpass him? It's already an honor for me to be included at all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong exchanged glances, both seeing the same shock and suspicion in each other's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Both men couldn't help but wonder the same thing: if Ning Zhuo had never coveted the second seat, why had he gone to such lengths?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">They had severely underestimated Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">To him, this was hardly a major undertaking. Revealing his true intentions might have been hurtful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Initially, Ning Zhuo had simply wanted to test the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He had learned about Gongsun Yan's situation from Shen Xi's flying message and, on a whim, decided to treat Gongsun Yan's illness. Of course, there was also an element of intimidation involved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">But he never expected Gongsun Yan to surrender so easily!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Having already undermined Lin Jinglong's position, Ning Zhuo had no choice but to seize the opportunity and use Lin Jinglong as a test subject for the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Fan's combat prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Lin Jinglong was no match for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">To smooth things over, Ning Zhuo had Yu Heye arrange another meeting, inviting Lin Jinglong and Shen Xi. Su Lingkou was merely an afterthought, of no real importance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Shen Xi stared at Ning Zhuo, hurrying to say, "Fellow Daoist Ning, your profound understanding of the Five Elements and extraordinary strength far surpass ours. You rightfully deserve the second seat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo replied, "What? I merely relied on the advantages of my Magic Artifact. Besides, my exchange with Fellow Daoist Lin was just a friendly spar, not a life-or-death battle. He undoubtedly held back his magic treasures and trump cards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"If we were to truly clash, the outcome would be unpredictable," Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Lin Jinglong smiled slightly, acknowledging the truth in Ning Zhuo's words. He had indeed held back his trump cards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">However, Ning Zhuo's lack of ambition for second place genuinely puzzled him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Still wanting to probe Ning Zhuo's true intentions, Lin Jinglong remarked, "Fellow Daoist Ning, you're being far too modest. Setting aside everything else, this Ghost Path Golden Core alone would secure you the second position. Such a grand gesture is beyond my capabilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">As he spoke, Lin Jinglong proactively retrieved the Ghost Path Golden Core and displayed it for all to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Shen Xi looked puzzled, while Su Lingkou directly asked, "Young Master Lin, did Young Master Ning Zhuo also give you this Golden Core?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Lin Jinglong nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Yu Heye's pupils constricted involuntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Among those present, Yu Heye possessed the highest cultivation level, being a Golden Core cultivator himself. But now, upon learning that Ning Zhuo had gifted a second Golden Core to someone else, Yu Heye's psychological advantage from his cultivation level completely vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Su Lingkou frowned, recalling that her cousin had obtained the Ghost Path Golden Core only by sacrificing his beloved Array Dao Magical Treasure, the Array Rift Shuttle. What had Lin Jinglong given in exchange?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">In truth, Shen Xi and Yu Heye shared the same question.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Lin Jinglong then explained that Ning Zhuo had given him the Ghost Path Golden Core to help Gongsun Yan break free from his contract with the Lin Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The answer was truly unexpected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yu Heye, Shen Xi, and Su Lingkou all turned their gazes toward Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Gongsun Yan nodded. "It is my honor to serve Young Master Ning Zhuo. I am also grateful for his assistance in covering my expenses..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Ah, no need for such formalities," Ning Zhuo interrupted. "It is my honor to have Fellow Daoist Gongsun Yan's assistance. This isn't a matter of covering expenses; it's a response to this honor and gratitude to the Lin Clan for helping Fellow Daoist Gongsun alleviate the flaws in his Innate Talent. My connection with Fellow Daoist Gongsun is all thanks to the Lin Clan, especially Fellow Daoist Lin Jinglong's magnanimity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Though Ning Zhuo's words were elegantly phrased, Shen Xi, a shrewd observer, saw through the facade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He was inwardly astonished. He had never imagined Ning Zhuo would directly poach Lin Jinglong's most valuable asset!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Lin Jinglong isn't even angry?! Shen Xi glanced at Lin Jinglong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Noticing the gaze, Lin Jinglong offered Shen Xi a bitter smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Shen Xi was even more shocked, suddenly realizing: Gongsun Yan was Lin Jinglong's most valuable subordinate. If he defected, Lin Jinglong would never let it go quietly. But his current attitude suggests Ning Zhuo has already dealt him a crushing blow, thoroughly intimidating him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo may have given him a Ghost Path Golden Core, but Lin Jinglong would never react this way over a single Golden Core!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"The question is," someone murmured, "was Lin Jinglong intimidated by the powerful elders backing Ning Zhuo, or did Ning Zhuo simply beat him into submission?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo quickly waved his hand, his tone humble. "Fellow Daoist Lin showed great generosity in helping Fellow Daoist Gongsun and me forge our connection. We cannot act the villain and let this matter fester, allowing others to exploit it and belittle Fellow Daoist Lin and the Lin Clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Therefore, I implore you all to keep this matter confidential and remain tight-lipped."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">These words immediately earned Lin Jinglong's goodwill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Shen Xi sighed and agreed, "Of course, this is for our own good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Su Lingkou's emotions were complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">She instinctively glanced at Gongsun Yan. They had fought to a draw the previous day, though she had actually been at a disadvantage. The sheer power of his Heartfire still left her secretly shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yet only a day later, Gongsun Yan had become Ning Zhuo's subordinate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">How did he manage that?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">What price did Ning Zhuo offer?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Su Lingkou shifted her gaze back to Ning Zhuo, and in that moment, she suddenly realized: Ning Zhuo was no ordinary cultivator like herself or Gongsun Yan. His status was likely comparable to that of her own cousin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">What price did Ning Zhuo offer?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">This question also lingered in Lin Jinglong's mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Lin Jinglong secretly observed Gongsun Yan and was astonished to find him radiating vitality, his demeanor now exuding an unfamiliar confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Lin Jinglong recalled his battle with Ning Zhuo and secretly speculated, "Ning Zhuo's fan must be his Lifebound Magical Artifact, explaining its immense power. He only revealed one defensive magic treasure earlier, so he's definitely hiding other trump cards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"He likely cultivates a Five Elements-based Cultivation Art. Perhaps his other magic treasure is also Five Elements-aligned, specifically designed to counteract the flaws of his Melting Heart Talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"That's why Gongsun Yan defected to his side!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Magic treasures? I have plenty too... three in total!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"I simply didn't need to use any during our earlier sparring match."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Though Ning Zhuo had "fought him to a draw," Lin Jinglong secretly believed he could have won. His family's pragmatic approach dictated that he withdraw when he had the upper hand, avoiding unnecessary conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"As for the Golden Cores... Ning Zhuo's consecutive display of two Golden Cores was undoubtedly meant to showcase his deep reserves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Given this momentum, he likely possesses more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"But not many!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"These are Golden Cores! He couldn't possibly have ten or more, right? Hahaha."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Lin Jinglong continued to mentally assess Ning Zhuo's capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Perhaps distracted by these thoughts, he lost the next round of rock-paper-scissors to Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">With this, Shen Xi claimed the second-place seat, while Lin Jinglong settled into third. As for Ning Zhuo, he explicitly stated that he would refrain from participating in the ranking for the time being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"As long as I can interact with everyone, learn together, and improve together, I'll be content!" Ning Zhuo said with genuine humility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">There's really no need for all this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">His current priority was to wait for his true identity to be revealed. Until then, he needed to gather as much information as possible about the surrounding situation and find the most suitable entry point for himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">After the banquet concluded and he bid farewell to the others, Ning Zhuo returned to his Immortal's Cave on a cloud, his expression thoughtful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Old Chef was guarding the cave, while Qing Chi rushed out to greet him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo asked her a few concerned questions about her cultivation progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Although Qing Chi had lost her memories, her cultivation base remained intact. Having already reached the Foundation Establishment Stage, switching to a new Cultivation Art would come at a tremendous cost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Therefore, she continued practicing her original Cultivation Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Young Master, everything is going smoothly!" Qing Chi assured him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">This was to be expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Even without her memories, Qing Chi's body had practiced the Cultivation Art countless times, establishing a kind of muscle memory. Moreover, her Ghost Person physique had been gradually transformed by the art itself, adapting her form to better suit its principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thus, Qing Chi's reacquaintance with the Cultivation Art posed no real challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"This is Fellow Daoist Gongsun Yan," Ning Zhuo introduced Gongsun Yan to the pair. "He has also agreed to join us in our cultivation endeavors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Gongsun Yan followed Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, glancing up and down at Old Chef and Qing Chi before offering a perfunctory bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Both Old Chef and Qing Chi were at the Foundation Establishment Stage, which Gongsun Yan assumed meant they were Ning Zhuo's servants or subordinates, unlike Sun Lingtong's more intimate role as a book attendant. Consequently, Gongsun Yan's attitude remained indifferent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Had Qing Chi been a Human female cultivator, Gongsun Yan might have assumed she was Ning Zhuo's personal maid and treated her with greater respect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">But as a member of the Ghost-Human Clan...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Gongsun Yan instinctively regarded Qing Chi as an ordinary subordinate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo first settled Gongsun Yan into his quarters before entering the cultivation chamber to begin his practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The six stages of the Foundation Establishment Stage were: Unobstructed Field Opening, Nurturing Precious Medicines, Radiant Dantian, Phenomenal Seed Talisman, Golden Light Illumination, and Transforming Void into Reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo's cultivation had already advanced to the Phenomenal Seed Talisman stage, placing him in the late-middle to late stages of the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He had resumed cultivation at the age of sixteen, switching to the Three Sects' Supreme Methods. Since these methods involved cultivating three dantian simultaneously, his progress should have been exceptionally slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Yet at seventeen, Ning Zhuo had already reached the late-middle stages - a cultivation speed that was nothing short of astonishing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Even more terrifying was that his primary focus wasn't even on cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">His most important goal was to save Meng Yaoyin. After leaving Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he spent most of his time traveling, though he diligently continued his cultivation. However, the actual time he devoted to cultivation was remarkably scarce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo knew perfectly well that his terrifyingly efficient cultivation speed stemmed entirely from external aids. These included the Three Luminaries Intersecting Treasure Talisman, vast quantities of Spirit Stones, and, most crucially, the National Power Brick!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Cultivating with the National Power Brick was truly miraculous, granting a sensation akin to ascending to heaven!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo had been fortunate enough to experience this several times. He still possessed a National Power Brick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">However, during the Phenomenal Seed Talisman stage, brute force alone wouldn't suffice. It required cultivators to demonstrate their comprehension of the cultivation art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"My cultivation in the divine sea and Qi Sea has already reached the required level, granting me the Spirit Communication Art and Five Elements Creation and Destruction Art respectively. But the Essence Sea's corresponding cultivation art, the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art, still lags far behind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Ah... I suppose I truly belong to the Righteous Path. Demonic Path cultivation arts just aren't suited for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo had already devised a plan to accelerate his comprehension of the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He retrieved a flower bud - the Dharma Aspect's seal from the Red Flower Battle Formation - within which Lin You was imprisoned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">This person was the son of the Demon Heart Cave Master, practicing the same cultivation art as his father, which should be quite similar to the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo had originally planned to educate him in the ways of the Righteous Path, hoping to extract the cultivation art from him. This would not only help Ning Zhuo comprehend demonic techniques but also serve as atonement for the young man's sins, contributing to the Righteous Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">However, Ning Zhuo hadn't expected the flower bud to still exist after passing White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"So much time has passed... Could Lin You have already starved to death?" A sense of foreboding washed over Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Yet, faced with the red flower bud, he felt utterly helpless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">This was the power of military strategy. Had it been a Five Elements Spell, Ning Zhuo could have handled it with ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">There was another such flower bud, imprisoning Wu Hen. Similarly, though the bud appeared fragile, its resilient material continued to firmly seal the cultivator within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo stored the flower buds away and fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">He channeled his Five Elements Spiritual Power, activating his Innate Spell, the Five Elements Creation and Destruction Art, while secretly mobilizing the Wood Element Lung Temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Vast quantities of Wood Element Spiritual Power surged from his palm, swirling, growing, and continuously transforming within his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">This process continued for the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea. Suddenly, amidst the ever-shifting emerald spiritual energy, a spark of electricity crackled!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
