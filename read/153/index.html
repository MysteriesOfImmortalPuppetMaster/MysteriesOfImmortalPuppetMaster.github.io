<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo tinkered away, utilizing the facilities in the preparation room to swiftly process the previously selected mechanical components like the Hanging Loop and the Small Flying Box.<br/>
<br/>
The Hanging Loop was transformed into a Cocooning Hanging Loop.<br/>
<br/>
When thrown, upon contact with an object, it would emit countless threads, wrapping the target layer by layer into a cocoon, suspending it from the ceiling.<br/>
<br/>
The Small Box was modified into a flying shield.<br/>
<br/>
The shield would orbit around the puppet, automatically defending and absorbing various attacking spells.<br/>
<br/>
Once the spell power accumulated to its storage limit, the Small Flying Box Shield would self-destruct, with a considerable explosive force.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo named it "Honest Man."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo distributed these modified mechanical components to everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, everyone in the preparation room was testing them out, praising Ning Zhuo's craftsmanship.<br/>
<br/>
Taking advantage of everyone's immersion in practice, Ning Zhuo stood before the five stone pillars and, under the watchful gaze of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, "discovered" the trial disciple's mark.<br/>
<br/>
"Come and see, everyone, look what I found!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone gathered around.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo displayed the "newly" obtained trial disciple's mark to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone was overjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Many people said, "This discovery is too important!" "It will greatly aid our future exploration of the Immortal Palace." "Ah Zhuo, with this contribution, I believe you can get the Ice Jade Wine!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ice Jade Wine?!" Ning Zhuo immediately showed a longing expression, "I've heard about it since I was a child, I really want to taste it." "Who doesn't?!" Everyone laughed, their morale soaring.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, Ning Zhuo led everyone, relying on the modified mechanical components and his own exceptional control abilities, to successfully pass through one trial after another, all the way to the eighth trial!<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng appeared before everyone.<br/>
<br/>
"This mechanical ape has finally appeared!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ah Zhuo, this time we might only be able to stop here."<br/>
<br/>
"But it doesn't matter, this achievement is already quite remarkable, we've broken the previous record!" "That's right, when we return to the family, Ah Zhuo, you will surely receive a great reward." "Maybe there will be Ice Jade Wine, hahaha."<br/>
<br/>
Having reached this point, the Ning family members were already at their limits.<br/>
<br/>
Due to Ning Zhuo's deliberate arrangement, he had gradually "sacrificed" some companions in the previous trials.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Yuan Dasheng appeared, his giant puppet had significantly shrunk, leaving only five companions.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's battle intent was firm: "We haven't fought yet, how can we say we've lost? Let's work together and fight this mechanical ape to the end!" Everyone shouted in unison, their morale fully aroused by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
However, Yuan Dasheng's strength was indeed "formidable," and the heads on the giant puppet's body were taken down one by one.<br/>
<br/>
When only Ning Zhuo was left, Yuan Dasheng half-knelt on the ground: "Master, this subordinate has committed a grave offense by attacking you, please punish me!" Ning Zhuo coughed, trying hard to play the role of the master, first saying it was a ruse, then ordering Yuan Dasheng to atone for his sins through meritorious service.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully selected his equipment, had Yuan Dasheng clear the way, passed the ninth trial, and entered the central hall.<br/>
<br/>
He pushed open the first Buddha Gate, passed three trials in a row.<br/>
<br/>
During the reward phase, he no longer had the option of the Illusory True Lotus Seeds, so he chose a spell to enhance his simultaneous sensing of multiple mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
He entered the second central hall, activated the sixth-level peak Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, and successfully pushed open the second Buddha Gate.<br/>
<br/>
"A brand new trial, here I come!" He stepped inside.<br/>
<br/>
He returned defeated.<br/>
<br/>
In the first trial behind the Buddha Gate, he was just a bit short of passing.<br/>
<br/>
When he woke up, he was greeted with compliments and congratulations from his clan members, and Ning Xiaohui personally came to encourage him with a joyful face.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's performance this time was truly astonishing!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took the opportunity to make his request: "Uncle Xiaohui, with this merit, can I get the Ice Jade Wine?" Ning Xiaohui's eye twitched slightly, but he smiled broadly and patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder: "Alright, I'll do my best to get it for you!"<br/>
<br/>
In the capital of the Southern Bean Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
In the Golden Luan Hall.<br/>
<br/>
The King of the Southern Bean Kingdom looked at the memorial in front of him, deeply furrowing his brows.<br/>
<br/>
This memorial was jointly submitted by the Lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Meng Kui, and the Divine Constable, Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
"There are indeed problems on Fire Persimmon Mountain!" "Dispatch reinforcements..."<br/>
<br/>
The King of the Southern Bean Kingdom felt deeply troubled.<br/>
<br/>
In this world, the Southern Bean Kingdom was not the only powerful nation.<br/>
<br/>
Once the news of the Lava Immortal Palace's emergence leaked, it would inevitably attract countless covetous eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Various major forces would extend their reach.<br/>
<br/>
Unless the Southern Bean Kingdom dispatched a large army, it would be difficult to guard Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The King of the Southern Bean Kingdom was well aware that the cultivation nations had been engaged in a frantic arms race for nearly a century.<br/>
<br/>
Some large nations still had some reserves, but medium-sized nations like the Southern Bean Kingdom were already exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
As for the small nations, they had long fallen behind.<br/>
<br/>
The Southern Bean Kingdom had heavy troops and generals guarding key locations and borders, forming a balance of power with neighboring nations and forces.<br/>
<br/>
To dispatch a large army would require drawing these troops and generals, which would be a major upheaval.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there were idle military forces, namely the Southern Bean Kingdom's strongest army—the Imperial Guard.<br/>
<br/>
But this army was responsible for guarding the capital and was of great significance, not to be moved lightly.<br/>
<br/>
One couldn't just dispatch the Imperial Guard because of an incident in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, right?<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Fire Persimmon Immortal City was a relatively new city in the Southern Bean Kingdom, with relatively low cultivation resources and population.<br/>
<br/>
Dispatching a large army was impractical, so what about sending some strong cultivators?<br/>
<br/>
The King of the Southern Bean Kingdom quickly thought through the candidates, furrowing his brows even more.<br/>
<br/>
The Southern Bean Kingdom had been established for several hundred years, and the old ministers' forces were deeply entrenched.<br/>
<br/>
They were intermarried and allied, with intertwined interests.<br/>
<br/>
People from the Meng family and those close to the Meng family couldn't be chosen.<br/>
<br/>
So, could other people be chosen?<br/>
<br/>
Those qualified to contend with the Meng family, like the Su family.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing someone from the Su family would be like giving them an opportunity to compete for the Lava Immortal Palace, wouldn't it?<br/>
<br/>
Were there people without ties to these old ministerial forces?<br/>
<br/>
There were.<br/>
<br/>
But wouldn't such candidates be targeted and drawn in?<br/>
<br/>
In fact, this had happened many times before.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhu family, which held the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal power, had never been stable.<br/>
<br/>
Because fundamentally, the founding emperor had no royal mandate! It was all thanks to the divine abilities of the three sects' elders.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhu family had passed down to the third generation, still without a royal mandate, and no heirs to inherit the divine abilities.<br/>
<br/>
"Since the Zhu family can be the ruler of a nation, why can't my family?" The Ai family and the Su family, these large cultivation clans, were constantly scheming.<br/>
<br/>
The King of the Southern Bean Kingdom felt lonely and isolated, the high position was indeed cold.<br/>
<br/>
In such circumstances, only the royal family members could be considered reliable!<br/>
<br/>
However, the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family was lacking in talent, and Zhu Xuanji was already considered one of the most outstanding.<br/>
<br/>
If not, the King of the Southern Bean Kingdom wouldn't have specifically sent Zhu Xuanji to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
As the ruler of a nation, the King of the Southern Bean Kingdom thought it over and found no suitable candidate among the court officials to send as reinforcements!<br/>
<br/>
Now, with the turmoil in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and the covetous eyes of various heroes, how should it be handled?<br/>
<br/>
The dilemma was placed before the King of the Southern Bean Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Several days later.<br/>
<br/>
An imperial envoy from the Southern Bean Kingdom's capital floated high in the sky, reciting in a long, drawn-out tone: "The King has a decree, please receive it, Lord of Fire Persimmon City."<br/>
<br/>
"By the mandate of Heaven, the King declares: The Lava Immortal Palace belongs to the three sects' elders and is not the property of this nation. The three sects' elders, out of compassion for the common people, left the palace to suppress Fire Persimmon Mountain for many years. The Southern Bean Kingdom built a grand formation and established Fire Persimmon Immortal City, all thanks to the three sects' elders."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, with the emergence of the Immortal Palace and the selection of an heir, the Southern Bean Kingdom, out of gratitude for the elders' compassion, welcomes this and should not obstruct it. However, the Lava Immortal Palace suppresses the volcano, concerning the safety of hundreds of thousands of city residents, and cannot be moved. This is also the original intention of the three sects' elders."<br/>
<br/>
"Now, a Recruitment Decree is issued, widely recruiting talents regardless of background, allowing free entry and exit of the Immortal Palace to compete for the right of inheritance, with no external restrictions."<br/>
<br/>
"The person who inherits the Immortal Palace can enter the court as an official, up to the fourth rank! Those unwilling to enter the court must return the position of city lord according to the Recruitment Decree. The Southern Bean Kingdom will provide ample compensation."<br/>
<br/>
"Anyone who enters the city or the palace without signing the decree will be considered an enemy of the Southern Bean Kingdom and will be killed, with a heavy reward from the capital..."<br/>
<br/>
The envoy's words were like a great bell, clearly enunciated, spreading throughout Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The city residents looked up, listening quietly.<br/>
<br/>
After listening, the previously silent Fire Persimmon Immortal City suddenly erupted in excitement, with people cheering and spreading the news!<br/>
<br/>
"Did you hear that?"<br/>
<br/>
"The three sects' elders, they are Void Refining Stage experts."<br/>
<br/>
"He is truly great, I only now realize that the greatest contributor to Fire Persimmon Mountain is him!" "He left behind the palace, and the Lava Immortal Palace is selecting an heir?"<br/>
<br/>
"That's wonderful! What a rare opportunity."<br/>
<br/>
"I feel like I am the future master of the Immortal Palace! It turns out my life's turning point is here!"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui stood up, receiving the flying decree with both hands, his eyes flashing with thoughtful light.<br/>
<br/>
The King of the Southern Bean Kingdom's handling of the situation was somewhat unexpected for Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, spreading the news of the Lava Immortal Palace's emergence was his idea.<br/>
<br/>
The reason was that Meng Kui could no longer stop Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, along with the Golden Core ancestors of the three major families, frequently entered and exited the Immortal Palace, leaving Meng Kui's presence there only to suppress any palace riots.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, his continued presence gave Zhu Xuanji the best reason to draw in the three major families.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui was worried that Zhu Xuanji might make a breakthrough and eventually inherit the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Especially since he personally saw Zhu Xuanji present three quasi-Golden Core level mechanical beasts to the Lava Immortal Palace in exchange for contributions.<br/>
<br/>
This was a significant gesture, showing that Zhu Xuanji was well-prepared.<br/>
<br/>
Or more accurately, the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family was strongly supporting Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Meng Chong had suffered repeated setbacks.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical ape and mechanical puppets were too powerful, and Meng Kui couldn't see a short-term breakthrough.<br/>
<br/>
All these reasons prompted Meng Kui to actively spread the news, inviting wolves into the house, and forcing the royal family to respond.<br/>
<br/>
The Meng family was well aware of the internal situation of the Southern Bean Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui concluded that the Southern Bean Kingdom couldn't mobilize a large army to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, they would send strong cultivators as reinforcements.<br/>
<br/>
And the cultivators' cultivation level would be at least Nascent Soul Stage.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui thought this was the most likely scenario.<br/>
<br/>
He had already informed the Meng family that once the candidate was decided, the Meng family would make every effort to draw them in.<br/>
<br/>
But in the end, the envoy brought a decree, a Recruitment Decree!</div>
