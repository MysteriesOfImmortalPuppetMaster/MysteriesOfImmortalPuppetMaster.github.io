<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 90: Ning Zhuo, My Nephew, You've Suffered!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Ze and the others were all stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Xiaoren glared angrily at Ning Ze. ‚ÄúNot stopping yet!?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">As he spoke, he tore off the identity token hanging from his waist and hurled it forcefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The token struck Ning Ze squarely on the forehead, knocking his head back and nearly causing him to fall to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Ze staggered back a step to steady himself and quickly bowed. ‚ÄúGreetings, Sir Junior Patriarch!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">A stream of blood flowed down his forehead as he spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Once again, Ning Xiaoren had caused his head to bleed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Father-Son Bracelet‚Äôs activation was naturally interrupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After shooting Ning Ze a vicious glare, Ning Xiaoren hurried over to Ning Zhuo‚Äôs side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He swung his leg to kick away one of the Ning Clan cultivators holding down Ning Zhuo, then barked at the other, ‚ÄúGet lost!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The two burly Ning Clan cultivators quickly retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Xiaoren immediately reached out to support Ning Zhuo, his eyes red with emotion and his face full of guilt and concern. ‚ÄúNing Zhuo, little nephew, I came too late. I, your uncle, came too late, and you had to suffer such torment! To see you like this breaks my heart.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">As long as the Father-Son Bracelet didn‚Äôt activate, Ning Zhuo wouldn‚Äôt feel any pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But Ning Xiaoren still took out a high-grade medicinal pill and handed it to Ning Zhuo. ‚ÄúNephew Ning Zhuo, my magical power is different from yours, so I can‚Äôt regulate your body‚Äôs energy for you. But you can take this medicinal pill. Its restorative powers are top of the line!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo‚Äôs face was pale, and he panted heavily. He weakly pushed the medicinal pill away, showing the fear and confusion of a young boy. ‚ÄúSir Junior Patriarch Sir, I, I‚Ä¶ why are you‚Ä¶‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo had been on the verge of success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The arrival of the Ning Clan investigation team was one of the outcomes he had foreseen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He had made a splash at the joint test of the three clans and had long anticipated that various factions would secretly investigate and look into him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">That didn‚Äôt matter!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">If they didn‚Äôt investigate, Fei Si and Zhu Xuanji definitely would. Even if they weren‚Äôt doing it now, they would in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Being investigated now was actually to Ning Zhuo‚Äôs advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">It was a unique kind of opportunity. If he used it well, he could ‚Äúexplain‚Äù himself to the outside world. In truth, it was a way to further conceal himself, as well as a chance for him to display his own value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Ze had been influenced by the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. Of course, this was based on his own existing fear and anxiety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">By now, Ning Zhuo had reached the third layer of Qi Refining, the third layer of Essence Refining, and the third layer of Spirit Refining. He was far stronger than before. Although he would still suffer a nosebleed from slight usage of the treasure seal, the backlash would be delayed a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Father-Son Bracelet forcibly extracted thoughts, so the nosebleed wouldn‚Äôt seem out of place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo needed to explain to the outside world why his cultivation base had progressed so quickly. Being compatible with the technique wasn‚Äôt enough; he also needed to show off his wealth of spirit stones and signal that he had plentiful cultivation resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">At this moment, he had to ‚Äúpublicly use‚Äù this wealth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Fei Si, Chi Dun, and Zhu Xuanji all knew that he was the true creator of the mechanism explosive fire monkey, and had obtained a huge sum of money through the sales.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Logically speaking, any normal young cultivator who came into possession of such wealth would absolutely spend it. If he didn‚Äôt buy resources to advance his cultivation base, that would be completely unreasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Over his sixteen years of life, his public persona had never displayed any inclination of being a stingy miser.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">As long as he successfully provided an explanation, Ning Zhuo would then be able to openly spend his money. He could go to pill pavilions or pharmacies and bulk purchase cultivation resources, allowing him to advance his cultivation base with full effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This would bring him great benefits, especially since he needed a spot in the upcoming joint recultivation team that the three clans would be forming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">With the arrival of Ning Ze and the others, Ning Zhuo was all set for his performance. An artifact like the Father-Son Bracelet had long been recorded in his information archive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He had prepared some thoughts in his divine sea; as long as they were captured by the bracelet, Ning Ze would receive the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">But just as he was about to succeed, Ning Xiaoren appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo really wanted to know why Ning Xiaoren had suddenly barged in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">In Ning Xiaoren‚Äôs heart, there was only relief. ‚ÄúI made it in time. Thank the heavens I made it in time!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">As it turned out, while the three patriarchs were negotiating, Zhu Xuanji had suddenly come to request records. Before leaving, he took the initiative to reveal the secret of Ning Zhuo and the explosive fire monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">All three patriarchs were high-level figures. They believed Zhu Xuanji‚Äôs words immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Xuanji was a divine investigator and a man of the royal family. His words carried great weight and were almost certainly correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Recently, explosive fire monkeys had been selling like hotcakes. The three clans had each sent many Foundation Establishment cultivators to participate in the Fire Persimmon Festival. The patriarchs were already well-informed about the mechanical monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Combined with Zhu Xuanji‚Äôs revelation, it only took a short while to deduce the truth. Fei Si had presented the treasure and claimed credit, while Chen Cha had secretly purchased the creator‚Äôs rights and falsely claimed to have invented the monkey. The real inventor was actually the Ning Clan‚Äôs Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Zhou and Zheng Clan patriarchs had immediately offered their congratulations to the Ning Clan patriarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Ning Clan patriarch was elated inside but maintained a modest exterior, saying the matter still needed investigation to be confirmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He then immediately summoned a Ning Clan attendant, ordering them to return to the clan and instruct the junior patriarch to quickly investigate and then properly reward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The attendant rushed back to the clan and met with Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Upon hearing the instructions, Ning Xiaoren had nearly jumped out of his skin. He immediately understood the source of Ning Zhuo‚Äôs wealth and recalled the investigation team he had personally dispatched. How could he dare remain idle at the clan estate?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Though it was already deep into the night, he had dashed out of his residence with all his might and sprinted like a madman to Ning Zhuo‚Äôs home.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">That was how the earlier scene came to be.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Xiaoren‚Äôs eyes reddened again, and he sighed bitterly. ‚ÄúNing Zhuo, my nephew, I‚Äôve really made you suffer! Uncle knows you‚Äôve been wronged, and you have your reasons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">‚ÄúDid you know? Over the past sixteen years, I have always been watching over you from the shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">‚ÄúI know your nature. I know you‚Äôre not a bad child. You wouldn‚Äôt do anything truly wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">‚ÄúI‚Äôll get to the bottom of what happened with this investigation team. I‚Äôll definitely give you an explanation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">‚ÄúBut after this incident, you must have realized that your situation is very complicated and full of hidden dangers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just too outstanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">‚ÄúSigh, the tall tree is the first to be blown down by the wind, the mound that rises above the shore will bear the brunt of the current. So many people are jealous of you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">‚ÄúI, your uncle, truly cannot stop worrying about you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">‚ÄúJust look, this investigation team showed up out of nowhere, and even your father‚Äôs brother got dragged into it.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Ze watched Ning Xiaoren‚Äôs performance with a heart full of disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you the one who personally ordered me to do all this?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre washing your hands of it completely?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Although Ning Ze was cursing furiously in his heart, he also knew he absolutely couldn‚Äôt expose his superior at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After all, a subordinate had to shoulder the blame for their boss when needed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Thus, Ning Ze stayed silent and quietly treated the wound on his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo looked at Ning Xiaoren, then at Ning Ze, then again at Ning Fan and the others. His youthful face showed fear and confusion, clearly at a loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">‚ÄúTh-then what should I do?‚Äù He cast a pleading look toward Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">At that moment, Ning Xiaoren did his best to show a gentle smile and spoke in the kindest, most sincere voice he could. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs easy. Nephew Ning Zhuo, come stay at my residence. I am the junior patriarch. I‚Äôll personally protect you.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo looked hesitant and lowered his head slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Xiaoren once again handed over the medicinal pill, his voice gentle as ever. ‚ÄúTake it.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo shook his head. ‚ÄúMy injuries aren‚Äôt serious. Using such a valuable medicinal pill would be a waste.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">‚ÄúHehehe.‚Äù Ning Xiaoren patted Ning Zhuo on the shoulder. ‚ÄúGood child, just take it. Consider it your uncle‚Äôs welcome gift. Come, let‚Äôs head home. You might not know this, but your father once saved my life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">‚ÄúIn the past, I had many difficulties and worries, and I couldn‚Äôt openly look after you. But now that you‚Äôre in danger, I must step forward personally. I‚Äôll protect you with everything I have.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo slowly raised his head, his face full of emotion. ‚ÄúTh-thank you, Sir Junior Patriar‚Äî‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt call me junior patriarch. Just call me Uncle Ning.‚Äù Ning Xiaoren once again extended the medicinal pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Only then did Ning Zhuo accept it, slightly embarrassed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">‚ÄúCome, let Uncle take you home!‚Äù Ning Xiaoren wrapped an arm around Ning Zhuo‚Äôs shoulder, helped him up, and prepared to lead him away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">After a few steps, Ning Zhuo paused. ‚ÄúWhat about the investigation into the spirit stones...?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Xiaoren said, ‚ÄúI, your uncle, swear that I will never use such cruel means on you. Let‚Äôs think about this and see if we can find a way around the contract. Even if we can‚Äôt, I will guarantee your safety with my position as junior patriarch on the line. You just need to cultivate without worry.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Upon hearing this, Ning Zhuo‚Äôs suspicions were nearly confirmed. ‚ÄúIt seems Ning Xiaoren has learned the secret of the explosive fire monkey from another source. It must be either Chi Dun or Zhu Xuanji.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Chi Dun and Fei Si were at odds, and Zhu Xuanji was backed by the royal family. Either one was possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo was perfectly happy to see this development.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Releasing the explosive fire monkey was partly to obscure the truth behind the bombing of the immortal palace and partly to reveal some mechanical arts talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo no longer resisted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Xiaoren was deliberately hiding the fact that he had discovered the truth, using this to express sincerity and draw Ning Zhuo to his side. But Ning Zhuo, too, wanted to get closer to Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">For the foreseeable future, taking shelter with this junior patriarch would allow him to conceal himself more effectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Xiaoren accompanied him the entire way, speaking warmly and reassuringly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Once they reached the residence, he shouted loudly, ‚ÄúClear out my bedroom and prepare it for my good nephew!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo quickly tried to stop him, but Ning Xiaoren‚Äôs eyes reddened again and he pleaded for Ning Zhuo to stay, to let him atone for his failure to properly care for his benefactor‚Äôs son.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">In the end, Ning Zhuo‚Äôs eyes also turned red. Looking deeply moved, he finally nodded and agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">As Ning Zhuo was about to go to sleep, Ning Xiaoren took out a talisman. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve only just reached the peak of the third layer. You haven‚Äôt experienced your soul being drawn into the palace yet, have you?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo nodded, and also expressed great curiosity about the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Xiaoren explained gently, ‚ÄúThe Lava Immortal Palace requires you to work together with others, or else you won‚Äôt be able to pass the tests. There‚Äôs no rush for now. Entering recklessly would only damage your soul and hinder your cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">‚ÄúStick this talisman to your body. It will slightly weaken your soul, just enough to prevent you from being pulled into the immortal palace. There‚Äôs only benefits and no harm to it.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">‚ÄúThank you, Uncle Ning!‚Äù Ning Zhuo quickly expressed his gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Xiaoren laughed heartily. After patting Ning Zhuo on the shoulder and reminding him to rest well, he took his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Once he returned to his study and was alone, Ning Xiaoren‚Äôs gentle expression immediately vanished. He called over a trusted attendant and said with a cold face, ‚ÄúBring a team of our people and search Ning Zhuo‚Äôs entire residence. Don‚Äôt leave any trace of disturbance, and make sure to gather all the information you can.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">‚ÄúYes, Sir!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
