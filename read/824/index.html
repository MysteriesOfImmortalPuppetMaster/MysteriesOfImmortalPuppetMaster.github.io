<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Alchemy, artifact refining, formation arrangement, and talisman crafting are known as the Four Great Arts of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Why are they called the "Four Great Arts"?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">On one hand, it is because these four crafts cover an extremely broad range of applications. Any cultivator, regardless of their path, will inevitably and frequently come into contact with them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">On the other hand, if a cultivator masters even one of these arts to a profound level, they can use it to earn resources and support their own cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Even if they do not specifically dedicate time and energy to studying them, as a cultivator grows older, they naturally accumulate significant knowledge in these four areas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The reason for this is simple - the longer one lives, the more one experiences the Four Great Arts, naturally increasing one's understanding of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">For example, if a cultivator buys a fake medicinal pill and suffers for it, the experience will leave a deep impression. Even if they do not study alchemy diligently, they will certainly pay close attention to it in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo felt this very deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Up to this day, he had absorbed three waves of demonic souls, internalizing the life experiences of many cultivators. These individuals all possessed varying degrees of understanding regarding the Four Great Arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">However, since they were demonic cultivators, most were better at fighting and killing; few had spent their time on meticulous research.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Of course, this was also related to the fact that the quality of the demonic souls Ning Zhuo had purchased was insufficient. Most of their understandings were shallow and repetitive, which resulted in Ning Zhuo’s attainment in these four arts not being particularly outstanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"In alchemy, formations, and talismans, I am only at the Artisan level. Only in artifact refining have I reached the level of a Renowned Artisan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">In that regard, he had the true intent of the Azure Martial Lord to thank for the infusion of knowledge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Next, if I want to deal with the Luo Shu Water Formation, I must boost my strength in formations!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo calmed his mind and analyzed the intelligence in his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The Rising Cloud Minor Trials had progressed to the point where countless tests regarding formations had emerged. This was a testament to the grand scale of the Four Great Arts in the cultivation world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="33"/>
<paragraph index="35">Silent Peak Abyssal Pond Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The location was by the edge of the Thousand-Year Ancient Pond, the [Abyssal Pond]. Cultivators participating in the trial had to use the pond water as a mirror and their own state of mind as the formation core to arrange a simplified version of the "Silent Peak Abyssal Pond Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">As long as the Nascent Soul cultivator Zheng Yue approved, the cultivator would pass the trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Years ago, when Zheng Yue had fallen into a low point in his life, he lived in seclusion near the [Abyssal Pond], building a simple hut. The Abyssal Pond was bottomless, and its water remained as still as a mirror year-round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zheng Yue meditated by the pond for seven years. His divine sense drifted, eventually communicating with the remains of an ancient Black Tortoise at the bottom of the pond. Through this, he attained enlightenment and created the Silent Peak Abyssal Pond Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The formation used stillness to control motion, meeting all changes with constancy, highlighting the advantages of a static formation to the extreme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">However, to arrange this formation, one had to use their own state of mind as the formation core. This requirement was extraordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">It was said that when Zheng Yue was seeking enlightenment by the pond, he sat still for three consecutive years without moving. When he finally opened his eyes, a phantom of the Black Tortoise flew out of the pond; upon entering the formation, it instantly transformed into a formation spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"I have the Innate Talent of the True Self and the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. Can I guarantee a stable state of mind? Would I have a unique advantage in this trial?" Ning Zhuo fell into thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Wind and Thunder Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">This formation was arranged at the summit of Soaring Peak. There, fierce winds howled all day, and thunderclouds swirled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Wind and Thunder Formation combined ever-changing celestial phenomena and was jointly arranged by two Nascent Soul cultivators, Lei Dongtian and Feng Jingyun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Cultivators participating in the trial had to persist within the formation for the duration of one stick of incense. During this time, the wind and thunder would constantly change - sometimes fierce winds, sometimes startling thunder, and sometimes both at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Because it was a dynamic formation, it was almost untraceable, and even the formation eyes moved randomly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo pondered: "My attainment in Wind and Lightning elements is very low. To succeed in persisting, I would have to use my divine sense to explore the formation and try my best to lock onto the formation eye. That’s my only hope."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Better forget it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo continued reading.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Five Elements Rotation Grand Formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Five Elements Peak specialized in the Dao of the Five Elements. Within the peak was a "Rotation Hall," which housed the "Five Elements Rotation Grand Formation." This formation was based on the five elements, following the cycle of mutual generation and overcoming, rotating without end. It was said that this formation was left behind by the founding ancestor of the Five Elements Peak and had been running for three thousand years without stopping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Participants had to enter the Rotation Hall and comprehend the "Five Elements Rotation Grand Formation" for one hour. Then, they had to answer questions in the examination area next to the hall. Answering ten questions correctly would pass the trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo had long kept this trial in mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Based on my Five Elements attainment, taking first place would be as easy as taking something from my own pocket."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The reason he hadn't chosen it was mainly that the rewards were quite low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The cultivator who took first place would receive a [Five Elements Rotation Token]. Holders of this token could enter the Five Elements Peak’s Library Pavilion to borrow and read all five-element cultivation arts and manuals. If they joined the Five Elements Peak, they would start with a mid-level position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="83"/>
<paragraph index="85">Five-Fold Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This was one of the trials opened by the Heavy Formation Peak, a classic manifestation of the technique of stacking multiple layers of formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Once, a Golden Core cultivator of the Myriad Manifestations Sect had single-handedly laid down the "Five-Fold Gate Grand Formation," trapping a peak Nascent Soul demonic cultivator for an entire month.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The brilliance of this formation lay in the five layers of formations being stacked upon each other; breaking one layer revealed another, and each layer would borrow the power used to break the previous layer, becoming stronger the more it was attacked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo thought: "This formation involves the skill of stacking formations, which is not my specialty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Map of Mountains, Rivers, and the State.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Strictly speaking, this was also a trial related to the Dao of Formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Map of Mountains, Rivers, and the State was kept in the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s Library Pavilion. It was left behind by an ancient powerhouse, and within the map was sealed a complete "World Formation." This formation used the mountains and rivers as its foundation and the state as its heart, capable of forming its own world, isolated from the outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Participants had to enter the formation physically, survive within the map’s "World Formation," and try their best to refine it, exerting all effort to master the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The higher the degree of mastery, the higher the cultivator’s ranking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Because the Map of Mountains, Rivers, and the State was at the Void Refinement grade and utilized ancient methods and ancient formations, cultivators participating in the trial almost never exceeded ten percent mastery during their survival time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">As for the reward, it was also minuscule. There was only one: the chance to become a Map Master of the Map of Mountains, Rivers, and the State in the future!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This was a regular Rising Cloud Minor Trial hosted by the Myriad Manifestations Sect. The goal was to screen as many suitable cultivators for the map as possible, selecting the best to be trained as Map Masters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">There wasn't just one Map Master, but over a hundred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Map of Mountains, Rivers, and the State was part of the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s hidden foundation; it was impossible for a single cultivator to control it. Usually, to bring out the map's full power, the collective strength of a group was required to drive and host it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Earth Fire Harvest Field Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ten Thousand Miles Ice Sealed Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ten Thousand Swords Returning to the Ancestor Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Illusion Sea Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Heavenly Dipper Big Dipper Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Universe Shift Formation...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The sheer variety of trials made Ning Zhuo feel increasingly dazzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"To bring out the Daoist Tool, the Luo Shu, I must break its formation. To practice the skill of breaking formations, this trial is currently the best choice." Ning Zhuo picked and chose, finally selecting his next target.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="131"/>
<paragraph index="133">Nine-Bend Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A crowd of cultivators had gathered here, waiting for today's trial to begin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"I heard that once you enter this formation, you can't walk out?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Isn't that right? Nine bends and eighteen turns; every bend is a loop. You think you're walking forward, but you're actually just spinning in place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Trying to break the formation is extremely difficult. Any delay, and the formation changes, making all previous scouting efforts useless. Let’s make a bet - bet on who lasts the longest!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This was the Nine-Bend Gallery Formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Another fixed Rising Cloud Minor Trial of the Heavy Formation Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo arrived on a cloud, instantly causing a small stir.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Look! It's actually Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"It really is him! He’s going to attempt the Nine-Bend Gallery?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"He just exchanged for a golden token; he really is at the peak of his fame."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Could it be that he has attainments in formations as well? Hiss... isn't his foundation a bit too deep?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Amidst the divine sense exchanges, Ning Zhuo walked slowly toward the entrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The cultivator on duty at the entrance saw Ning Zhuo and did not dare to be negligent. He stepped forward to welcome him, publicly stating that it was an honor for a genius like Ning Zhuo to participate in this trial and that he looked forward to a stunning performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo waved his hand. "I am not proficient in formations. I only want to use this rare opportunity to gain more exposure and broaden my horizons."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The crowd took his words as mere modesty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Many cultivators waiting to participate grew nervous, believing Ning Zhuo would be their greatest rival today.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">One person stepped out from the crowd and walked toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He was slender, his face like cold jade, and his eyes were as gentle as a light ink painting. A black wooden hairpin bound his hair, the tip embedded with a Sumeru Mustard Stone, emitting the aura of a magic treasure. He wore a plain green robe under a black silk cloud-patterned cloak, with Dual Polarity Glazed Buckles at the corners, naturally generating a protective light of purity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">It was none other than Ning Zhuo’s friend - Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Shen Xi gave a bitter smile. "I didn't expect to run into Brother Ning at this trial. It seems the top spot belongs to you this time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo quickly shook his head. "Brother Shen, you know my level in formations. I’m truly here just to broaden my experience and increase my knowledge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"But why is Brother Shen participating in this trial?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Shen Xi informed Ning Zhuo that the Nine-Bend Gallery used the Nine Palaces Formation in an extremely clever way, something highly respected by the Shen family. Shen Xi had been carefully groomed by his clan since childhood and had long heard of the Nine-Bend Gallery’s fame, always yearning to see it. Thus, he took this chance during the Flying Cloud Assembly to experience it firsthand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"I see." Ning Zhuo nodded, then asked, "Where is Fellow Daoist Su Lingkou?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Oh, she is currently putting all her effort into a weaving-related trial," Shen Xi replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The two exchanged a few more words before the Nine-Bend Gallery slowly opened its entrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The crowd filed in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo bid farewell to Shen Xi and stepped inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">In an instant, his vision changed abruptly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The corridor was wide, with vermillion pillars on both sides carved with exquisite patterns. Sunlight slanted in from outside the gallery, casting mottled shadows on the ground. Everything looked normal and peaceful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo first took a few steps forward, walking normally. After thirty steps, he stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He was clearly walking forward, but the patterns on the pillars on both sides were exactly the same as they were at the starting point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Behind him was an endless corridor, and before him was also an endless corridor. Ning Zhuo felt as if he were standing on a line with no beginning and no end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo closed his eyes, and his divine sense spread out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">As his divine sense expanded further, the consumption also grew more intense. The divine sense cultivated by the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Manual was not known for its volume or range. However, Ning Zhuo had supporting methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Immediately, he flew out a large number of mechanical mirrors, sending them flying rapidly in both directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">His divine sense reflected continuously between the mirrors, and his detection range underwent a qualitative change, beginning to soar at a terrifying rate. More importantly, while the range increased, the consumption of divine sense dropped drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Soon, Ning Zhuo discovered a clue - the spiritual energy around him was flowing slowly, forming a massive circle. His current position was a point on this circle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">He no longer walked forward blindly but stood in place, waiting quietly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">After the time it took for a stick of incense to burn, he had completely mastered the patterns of the spiritual energy flow. He discovered that this circle had nine nodes, corresponding to the nine bends. He was currently at the starting point of the first bend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">To walk out of the first bend, he needed to find the end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"That should be where the spiritual energy flows most slowly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">With this hypothesis, Ning Zhuo began to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He followed the flow of spiritual energy. To an outside observer, the big-headed youth was no longer walking straight forward; instead, he moved forward and backward. Sometimes he would take two or three steps forward, only to retreat five or six steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">What seemed like foolish behavior successfully allowed him to walk out of the first gallery bend and smoothly step into the second.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Even though the surrounding gallery was identical to the first bend, with no apparent difference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The cultivators presiding over the formation exchanged messages in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Ning Zhuo walked out of the first bend! So fast!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"He really does have some study in formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"But he’s not the fastest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The fastest was indeed Shen Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"The first bend of the gallery is the simplest. It’s not surprising for a genius like Ning Zhuo to break through it. Let’s keep watching."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">At this point, Ning Zhuo’s attempt at divine sense scouting failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The second bend of the gallery severely suppressed divine sense, so much so that even with his various mechanical mirrors, he could only scout a range of about three feet around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">And...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo stopped, staring quietly at the fork in the road before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">A fork had appeared in the second bend, something that had never happened in the first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The difficulty of cracking it had surged. Based on Ning Zhuo’s current perception, it was at least ten times harder!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, pondered for a moment, and suddenly broke into a wild sprint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">His physical foundation was massive, now capable of carrying the souls of a million people. With the addition of spells to boost himself, his speed became extremely fast. The pillars on both sides flew past him toward his rear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Consequently, forks in the road began to appear one after another in Ning Zhuo’s vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">He picked directions at random; the choice between the left or right fork didn't matter at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">What mattered was that every time he entered a fork, the formation in his perception would produce a very subtle fluctuation. These fluctuations were the echoes of the formation’s operation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo sprinted for the time it took to drink a cup of tea, finally using these echoes to accumulate enough data to reach a breakthrough in his calculations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Without hesitation, he began choosing the forks: left, right, left, left, right, right, left, right, right...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">After a dozen or so forks, his body felt light as he stepped out from the second bend into the third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The cultivators presiding over the formation looked at each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"Ning Zhuo has fallen far behind now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"It seems he was telling the truth; he really is just here to gain experience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"With this level of formation attainment, I’m afraid it will be very hard for him to pass the third bend."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo had used a "brute force" method, which took a long time. At this moment, many formation cultivators had already surpassed him.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
