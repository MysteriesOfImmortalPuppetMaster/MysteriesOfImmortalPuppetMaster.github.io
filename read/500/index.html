<paragraph index="1">Two days later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo was hiding inside the Mechanical Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">At this moment, the exterior of the Mechanical Dragon had undergone a dramatic change. Its entire body was covered with thick new decking, resembling layers of blood scabs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This was because Ning Zhuo used python-patterned blood cedar and dragon-scale stone as the primary materials—spending lavishly and re-enacting past work—to restore the Mechanical Dragon to its former state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">In fact, Ning Zhuo had taken only a day and a half to completely repair the Ten-Thousand-Li Traveling Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">After that, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to forging the mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He set up the Xuanyuan Nine Palaces Platform, the Xuan Palace Gear Platform, and the Giant Spirit Shaping Platform in three different cabins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">A Giant Spirit was brought out and sat on the floor, surrounding the base of the Shaping Platform, bowing its head and hunching its back while shaping the materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">It picked up a python-patterned blood cedar, extended its large hand, and stripped from the roots all the way to the treetop. With its immense strength, combined with the wondrous function of the Shaping Platform, a single pull produced a straight and smooth trunk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Giant Spirit also handled metal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">First, it gathered a large amount of metal and placed it in the palm of its hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Then its arm muscles bulged; using both hands, it forcefully compressed the metal into a sphere. Both palms pressed from various angles, making the metal ball smaller and smaller.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">During this process, a large amount of impurities turned into molten metal, flowed out, and became waste discarded to the side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After some compression, the Giant Spirit would pull the metal ball apart again, crumble it, and then compress it into a ball once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After several rounds of this, it obtained a shiny alloy sphere of pure color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It formed a hollow ring with its thumb and index finger, leaving its middle, ring, and pinky fingers to press and compress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Right away, the metal ball was squeezed so that a small lump emerged. The Giant Spirit used the thumb and index finger of its right hand to pinch off that small lump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">It placed the tiny lump of metal onto the surface of the Giant Spirit Shaping Platform, and with a quick rub of its palm, turned it into a perfect little sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">By repeating this method, a large number of small metal balls were produced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">After this rudimentary processing, the many materials were sent into the Xuan Palace Gear Platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">This palace-like mechanical platform rotated slowly. Inside, countless precise gears and mechanisms also rotated closely in sync, coordinating tightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Mechanic Art—Gear Deployment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo activated this mechanist art, using his divine sense to control and process all the materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">As Ning Zhuo operated the platform with full force, the gears and other mechanisms within emitted a subtle hum, as if some mysterious power was awakening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">All sorts of materials rapidly combined, and a large number of talismans were inserted. With many gears added, these mechanical puppet prototypes gained their initial ability to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo exhaled a turbid breath and opened the Xuan Palace Gear Platform. One after another, mechanical puppets flew out—there were forty-eight in a single batch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">These forty-eight mechanical puppet prototypes were finally sent to the third cabin of the Mechanical Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Xuanyuan Nine Palaces Platform was responsible for the final stage of the process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">One by one, the mechanical puppets lay on a simple, smooth tabletop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Below the tabletop, numerous talismans kept changing, flickering in and out of sight, combining with each other, coalescing into various talisman formations to produce different manufacturing processes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Heavenly Fire Smelting!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Inside and outside the mechanical puppets, countless flaws were burned and refined away by points of heavenly fire. Some heavenly flames were as large as fire tongues, some were mere sparks, and some were just tiny dots of flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Every speck of heavenly fire had exactly the necessary strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Stacked Forging!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">An invisible forging force, like waves of water, crashed against the mechanical puppets over and over from all directions. The puppets floated in midair, three feet above the table below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The forging force worked the puppets from every angle, leaving layered forging patterns on their surfaces, which looked quite striking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Refining and Finishing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The rough surfaces of the mechanical puppets grew smooth as flowing water. The impurities left behind by the heavenly fire smelting were precisely removed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Within the mechanical puppets, gears, grooves, and other structural parts were carved even more smoothly, fitting together flawlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">And so, the three mechanical platforms worked together in coordination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">A large number of mechanical puppets were created, saving Ning Zhuo an enormous amount of time and effort!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo had used up more than two hundred mechanical puppets in the previous battle. Now he replenished that number —and even exceeded it by over thirty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Clang, clang, clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Suddenly, an alarm resounded from the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Enemy attack!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“The enemy is coming!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo’s heart tightened. He immediately left the Ten-Thousand-Li Traveling Dragon and returned to the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The alarm rang throughout the entire army camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo activated a spell to bolster himself, then quickly stimulated several artifacts for protection and ran out of the military advisor’s tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang had already taken their positions, deploying soldiers to reinforce the defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">This time, the battle would be different from before. It was a defensive engagement around the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Where is the enemy?” Ning Zhuo climbed the watchtower, came to Liu Er’s side, and cast a spell to observe from a distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Soon, he saw a huge mass of purple-black poisonous miasma slowly rising at the foot of Dice-Bone Giant Wood Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Inside that poisonous fog, there was no telling what lay hidden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Three Generals’ Camp was currently situated on the mountainside. Though there was some distance from the poisonous fog, from the way it was moving, it was only a matter of time before the poison spread here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Liu Er’s brow was furrowed, his face worried. “Military Advisor, you’re here!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“You know our situation. If the enemy launches a frontal assault, even if we can’t beat them outright, we can at least make them pay. But now, they’re simply deploying poison fog, and none of our battle formations apply in a situation like this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Alas!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“The enemy has come prepared, specifically using methods that restrain our forces.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo withdrew his gaze and divine sense. “More importantly, we don’t know if there’s an ambush hidden within that poison fog.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Fortunately, we do have a camp to rely on, giving us some advantage of the terrain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“In my view, we should try to hold our ground for now, and if the situation looks dire, we should plan to retreat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Liu Er nodded. “That’s our only choice.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Right now, the enemy’s intentions were unclear, and the Three Generals’ Camp was in a reactive position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Building this camp had not been easy, and it contained many defensive powers —this was one of the strong points of the Three Generals’ Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Under these circumstances, staying put for defense was the best option.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">If the enemy had set an ambush around them, and they hastily abandoned their camp, it would be tantamount to discarding their advantage and throwing themselves straight into the ambush. The Three Generals’ Camp would inevitably suffer a massive blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“All forces, heed my order: hold your positions!” Liu Er commanded loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Then he used his divine sense to inquire, “Who can go out and probe the nature of this poison fog for us?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Zhang Hei immediately responded in a loud voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Right after that, Guan Hong also indicated he could head out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Liu Er hesitated in silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and said at once, “General, I have mechanical soldiers who do not fear sacrifice. Allow me to dispatch a squad of mechanical units to charge into the fog first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“If that doesn’t work, it won’t be too late for Generals Guan and Zhang to go.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Liu Er agreed immediately, approving and looking forward to Ning Zhuo’s plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo acted at once, taking a pair of mechanical puppets from his storage belt and tossing them out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The squad of mechanical puppets charged out from the Three Generals’ Camp, rushing all the way to the foot of the mountain and plunging straight into the poisonous fog.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Within that fog, there was no large enemy force —only a single Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">It was the Corrupt Poison General, Diao Ye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Diao Ye’s entire skin was a dark red, his face like an evil ghost. Seeing the mechanical puppets rush in, he immediately activated his magic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The poison fog wrapped itself around the mechanical puppets, seeping inside through every gap, attacking from both within and without with intense corrosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Very soon, these mechanical puppets were like candles burning vigorously. As they pressed forward, they grew shorter and moved more and more slowly, until they came to a standstill halfway, completely unable to continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo sensed the result and reported to Liu Er, “No large enemy army was encountered, but this poison fog is extremely corrosive. Once it drifts into our camp, I’m afraid our casualties will be severe.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Liu Er nodded. “We need to use some means to block this poison fog.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo spoke again. “We must conserve our fighting strength if we expect a battle. I can set up an altar and cast a spell, or I can lay down a stationary formation specially to guard against the poison fog.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Because the Three Generals’ Camp was in defensive posture and staying put, its formations could be expanded. It wasn’t just limited to moving formations; stationary formations were also an option.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">When it came down to it, there were far more types and variations of stationary formations than mobile ones!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Liu Er considered. “Your spiritual energy should also be conserved. Setting a stationary formation is the best plan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">So Ning Zhuo then led some cultivators in urgent preparations around the camp, starting to set up the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Thump, thump.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">A series of flying spears were suddenly launched, piercing many of the cultivators who were out setting up the formation for the Three Generals’ Camp, killing them on the spot!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Hahaha.” An arrogant male voice rang out. “You’re too naive! Setting up a formation under my nose? All of you can just die!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo’s pupils contracted. He instantly recognized the owner of the voice. “It’s the Venom Barbarian, Wu Lan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The soldiers of the Three Generals’ Camp stirred uneasily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">They couldn’t detect Wu Lan’s presence, yet he was killing them one by one. This was a hard blow to their morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Liu Er immediately issued words of encouragement to the troops, while sending more men to continue setting up the stationary formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Wu Lan, get out here!” Guan Hong, having received Liu Er’s order, charged out of the camp alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He held a Blood Dragon Saber in one hand, scanning the surroundings, feigning ignorance until suddenly he twisted his wrist and slashed with the blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">A dragon’s roar resounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Blood splattered everywhere!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Wu Lan let out a cold snort, nearly being cleaved in half. At the critical moment, he raised the poison-sting spear in his hand with great effort, managing to block the heavy, deadly edge of the saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Guan Hong lashed out with a kick, knocking Wu Lan straight into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Seeing Wu Lan’s embarrassing state, the soldiers of the Three Generals’ Camp let out a rousing cheer, and their morale took a clear upward turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“Hurry, follow my instructions to set up the formation,” Ning Zhuo urged, seizing the moment to guide soldiers in various positions for the stationary formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Wu Lan was pursued by Guan Hong, while Diao Ye seized the opportunity to use toxic magic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">One blob of poison fog after another, like huge rolling balls, advanced from the foot of the mountain up toward the mountainside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Liu Er and Zhang Hei struck one after another, detonating many of the giant poison spheres halfway up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Prepare the ballistae—fire!” Ning Zhuo, multitasking, commanded his fellow cultivators to operate the numerous ballistae in the Three Generals’ Camp, launching massive bolts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Those bolts also burst open quite a few of the rolling poison clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Just as the stationary formation was about to be completed, a foul wind sprang up. Thick black clouds materialized out of nowhere, rapidly shrouding the summit of the mountain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Poisonous water descended from the black clouds, drizzling down to form a toxic rain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The poison rain soaked the mountain terrain, corroding large puddles of poisonous liquid. Then, from those puddles crawled out pitch-black poison serpents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Initially, these poison snakes were only at the Qi Refining level, but quickly, Foundation Establishment-level serpents appeared, as large as galloping horses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Within several of the largest pools of poison, a Golden Core-level aura was brewing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning all turned grim at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">They recognized it immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">A divine ability —“Ten Thousand Serpents of Toxic Flow!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">This was the trump card of the Hundred Venoms Tribe’s Poison-Belly High Priest, Tu Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Once this technique was employed, it signified that the enemy had at least one Nascent Soul True Lord in play.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Only a little more effort was needed to finish the stationary formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Yet the toxic rain poured right on them, and poisonous snakes attacked in every direction, creating enormous pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">While Ning Zhuo hesitated, Liu Er decisively ordered that the formation be abandoned. “Clearly, this is Tu Ming’s plan. He’s using the lure of a completed formation to tempt us into continuing to send out our men.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo obeyed the order, withdrawing his soldiers with a sigh. “Alas, if only my mechanical puppets could be directed to set up the formation, that would be ideal!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">He spoke hurriedly, “Tu Ming once faced the White Jade Camp, and his poison magic is formidable. We don’t have the White Jade Camp’s resources, so our military equipment can’t defend against him. General, I propose that we attack at once and fight as we withdraw. At the very least, we can’t allow the poison fog to envelop us!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Liu Er nodded again and again. In this, he and Ning Zhuo were of the same mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Though the camp was valuable, it offered no real protection against such potent poison spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Clearly, the enemy had planned for this assault, sending Tu Ming, Diao Ye, and Wu Lan specifically to deal with the Three Generals’ Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">There was no doubt that the Three Generals’ Camp was at a huge disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Liu Er began to direct the troops, forming a battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">In this situation, Ning Zhuo’s Light Body Swift Wind Formation would have been ideal. Unfortunately, in daily drills, Ning Zhuo rarely participated, and the Three Generals’ Camp hadn’t practiced it much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Hence, Liu Er chose the Triangular Arrow Formation, leaving Generals Guan and Zhang to occupy Wu Lan and Diao Ye for a moment while he stood at the heart of the formation, with Ning Zhuo at the formation’s pivot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The Triangular Arrow Formation took shape. Outside the camp, the trenches had already been filled with toxic sludge, and even the chevaux-de-frise were entirely corroded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">With a single whistle, Liu Er signaled. Guan and Zhang both struck their opponents hard, then quickly withdrew into the army formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo immediately retreated to the center of the formation, letting Guan and Zhang take over the two formation pivots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Unlike Ning Zhuo, who was a novice at formation work, once Guan and Zhang joined the formation, the entire army felt its power surge, and the battle formation became much more fluid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Seeing the Three Generals’ Camp breaking out from their station, Wu Lan and Diao Ye did not dare to get close.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">At that moment, the might of the army formation was concentrated on Liu, Guan, and Zhang, making the three of them extremely powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Whereas earlier, Wu Lan had dared to fight Guan Hong in close quarters, now, at any sign that one of the generals might charge forward, he immediately backed far away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">This was not a time to take chances!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">A bit of carelessness, and one would lose his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">After the earlier ambush, both the Two Noted Kingdom and the Thousand Peaks Forest sides had gained insight into each other’s methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The Thousand Peaks Forest experts had a deep respect for the power of a military formation, so now they fought with utmost caution!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">The Three Generals’ Camp reached the foot of the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Liu Er lifted the Xuanhuang Sword high, using military tactics to grant the whole army a protective boost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Ning Zhuo cast a spell to stir up a strong wind, blocking the advance of the poisonous fog.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
