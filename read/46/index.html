<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The rewards for Room 2 were: two spirit stones, glass throwing knives, and the Fiery Grasp Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo chose the spirit stones without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In Room 3, he encountered the kung fu puppet again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The moment he saw it, Ning Zhuo leaped forward to hug the kung fu puppet, letting it beat down on him as he activated the Icy Embrace Art with all his strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">A while later, the kung fu puppet turned into a block of ice again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Its large eyes were glowing yellow, as if glaring at Ning Zhuo and lamenting his lack of martial ethics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo apologized internally. “I know that this level is to train my puppet body’s close combat skills. Unfortunately, I just don’t have the time. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll come practice here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The rewards for Room 3 were ten spirit stones, a little flying box, and the Wood Grafting Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo still chose the spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Finally, he arrived at the maintenance room once again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo felt a little excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Seeing that the ground was clean, he thought, “The puppet body from my second exploration has been cleared away.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He ran over to the rotating five-sided stone pillar and touched it with his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“I want my name off the ranking!” Full of determination, Ning Zhuo simultaneously mobilized his spirit and soul power to activate the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">And the treasure seal did not disappoint him. Soon, Ning Zhuo saw his name slowly sink into the pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">However, after his name completely disappeared, it gradually floated back up!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“What’s going on?!” Ning Zhuo was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit happily raised its head, opening its mouth and spewing out a ball of flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">It had a gloating expression on its face, as if saying, “Serves you right! That’s what you get for cheating with the Buddha Heart Demon Seal!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">If it weren’t for his puppet body, Ning Zhuo would have been covered in cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“I can’t hide my name?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“In other words, I have to leave my name here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Wait a moment, let’s think about it again. Maybe I can change the name on the pillar?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo tried it out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Surprisingly, he succeeded on the first attempt. Looking up, his name on the pillar had changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">It was no longer Ning Zhuo, but Ning Ji!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Roar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, which had just been so happy, was now utterly incensed to the point that it lifted its head and roared. Once again, the entire immortal palace quaked violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">High above Fire Persimmon Mountain, the Fire Persimmon City Lord immediately opened his eyes and stared vigilantly at the immortal palace inside the crater.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He watched for a while, and after confirming that the immortal palace wasn’t making any further movements, he slowly closed his eyes to resume meditation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo looked up at the ranking list and shook his head slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“I can’t change it to Ning Ji. It’d be exposed too easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“What if I change it to Meng Chong?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“No, that’s even worse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“When Meng Chong arrives at the maintenance room in the future, he’ll find himself occupying both first and second. That would give me away instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“What name should I change it to?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo was in a dilemma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Even if he used a completely unfamiliar name, there would still be flaws.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">After thinking for a while, Ning Zhuo suddenly came up with a good idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Soon, he looked at the changed name on the ranking list and muttered to himself, “This should be able to fool people for a while.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">In the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit rammed its head into the pillars again and again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Although it was the palace spirit, it was heavily restricted in what it could do. Watching someone cheat but being unable to stop them made it feel extremely pained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Each time it collided with a pillar, the entire Lava Immortal Palace trembled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Deep in the clouds, the City Lord suddenly woke up again. His brows furrowed as his eyes started shining. “Another eruption?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ready for battle, he waited for a long time, but he only saw the Lava Immortal Palace continuously shaking, stirring up waves in the lava below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ripples spread in a constant rhythm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The City Lord gradually relaxed. However, he was still puzzled. “Has the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gone crazy? What’s going on?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo was pleasantly surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He discovered that the moment he changed the name on one ranking list, it would also change on the other ranking lists.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He didn’t need to use up his spirit and soul power to change the names one by one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“The real situation was much simpler than expected!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“This is why you shouldn’t be afraid of difficulties. Sometimes, these difficulties are all in your own imagination.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo gave himself some encouragement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">At this point, he still had a lot of spirit power left. He also had some soul power remaining, so he could continue exploring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo didn’t hurry to move on to the next level and instead searched around in the maintenance room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He reached up to take a welding torch from the wall, receiving a prompt for payment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo didn’t plan to pay, instead activating the Buddha Heart Demon Seal again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Seeing this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit lashed its dragon tail and snorted disdainfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Soon afterward, Ning Zhuo sighed in disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Buddha Heart Demon Seal couldn’t allow him to use these tools for free. It couldn’t even get him a discount.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo realized that he needed to explore further to understand just what his treasure seal could do.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He walked over to the stone pillar again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The five-sided stone pillar would rotate every once in a while to display its five rankings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo touched the stone pillar and used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. In an instant, the stone pillar stopped rotating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Just as Ning Zhuo was feeling happy about this minor success, a thought flashed through his mind like a bolt of lightning!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">He abruptly raised his head and looked at the door of the maintenance room in excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo immediately ran to the door and was about to push it open to enter the next room, but suddenly retracted his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He then turned around and ran in the opposite direction, arriving in front of the door that he had entered from.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">At that moment, in the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had its front legs against the floor, and was staring tensely at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and tried opening the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The next moment, the door really opened!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Seeing this, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit suddenly raised its head and roared. It slammed a clawed hand on the floor, giving rise to countless sparks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo opened the door to see the scenery of Room 3 once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The kung fu doll was still frozen in an ice block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Suppressing his excitement, Ning Zhuo walked into Room 3 and closed the door. Then, he placed his palm against the door once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The reward list appeared again - ten spirit stones, a little flying box, and the Wood Grafting Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo chose the spirit stones, but although the circle of light appeared, it was empty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Then, he chose the little flying box. He received a wooden box that could hover in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Lastly, he chose the Wood Grafting Art, thereby obtaining another spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">In the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit rammed into the pillars again, roaring continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Its roars shook all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">But unlike before, the roars were mixed with strong emotions; for example, powerlessness, helplessness, and frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Lava Immortal Palace erupted again, causing countless treasure lights to pierce the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Again?!” The Fire Persimmon City Lord’s meditation was interrupted, causing him to puff his beard and shoot the immortal palace a glare. He had no choice but to activate the immortal city’s grand formation again to suppress the eruption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
