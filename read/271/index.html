<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 271: The Great Crisis of the Ning Family's Main Lineage</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Jiufan brought Ning Zhuo back to his residence. "You can stay in the side room," Ning Jiufan arranged for Ning Zhuo to be placed very close, right next to his study.<br/>
<br/>
After settling in, Ning Zhuo was summoned to the study by Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan assessed Ning Zhuo, asking him to create a few talismans in his presence.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo finished drawing them, Ning Jiufan scanned them with his divine sense, first nodding slightly, then shaking his head at the last two.<br/>
<br/>
"Your talisman-making skills are quite decent, your fundamentals are solid, but there's still a distance to the top level," Ning Jiufan commented. "Ancestor, talisman-making has never been my passion. What I love most is mechanical constructs," Ning Zhuo replied. "Your expectations of me are quite high. Reaching the top level you mentioned is not easy; it's rarely seen even among the top students."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan glared at Ning Zhuo, sternly saying, "The foundation of our Ning family lies in talisman-making. No matter how profound your mechanical skills are, you cannot neglect talisman-making!" "Firstly, it's our Ning family's specialty. Secondly, mechanical constructs encompass a hundred arts of cultivation, and talisman-making is one of them."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately bowed, "Ancestor, your teachings are correct. I will remember them well." Ning Jiufan continued, "The insights on talisman-making I gave you before, you must study them carefully." Ning Zhuo quickly assured him that he would read them whenever he had time.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan glared at him again.<br/>
<br/>
This junior Ning Zhuo was indeed smooth, and his attitude towards him was quite different from others! Even the head of the Ning family would be respectful and cautious in front of Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, did not have this attitude and was quite unruly.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Jiufan did not reprimand him too much.<br/>
<br/>
This was because very few people dared to treat him with such an attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was well aware of Ning Zhuo's growth and knew that, to some extent, Ning Zhuo had not been valued by the family since childhood and was like a wild child raised freely.<br/>
<br/>
The wild child Ning Zhuo's attitude towards him was understandable.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Ning Jiufan was also deeply aware of Ning Zhuo's talent and skills in mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
For this rising star among the younger generation, he felt a sense of fondness deep down.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Ning Jiufan not only tolerated Ning Zhuo's unruly attitude but also found him quite straightforward.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan had Ning Zhuo tidy up the study desk and then deliberately asked, "This time, City Lord Meng and Divine Constable Zhu have jointly set a contract, agreeing that no matter what position we obtain in the Lava Immortal Palace, it will be retained afterward. In the future, no matter who becomes the palace master, they will not arbitrarily revoke the positions of others."<br/>
<br/>
"What do you think of this? How do you think our Ning family should act?" Ning Zhuo immediately looked up at Ning Jiufan beside him and said without hesitation, "This is a great opportunity for our Ning family!" "If I were the head of the Ning family, upon hearing this news, I would immediately gather the entire clan and mobilize them to strive for more positions with all their might."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan remained expressionless and continued to ask, "Why do you think we should do this?" Ning Zhuo continued, "It's simple. The more positions our Ning family holds, the higher our control over the Lava Immortal Palace will be. No matter who becomes the palace master, the future Lava Immortal Palace will still be the core of Fire Persimmon Mountain."<br/>
<br/>
"The main role of the Lava Immortal Palace is to suppress Fire Persimmon Mountain, preventing it from erupting, continuously absorbing the earth flames from Fire Persimmon Mountain, and eliminating the proliferating scarlet flame demon beasts. These earth flames, scarlet flame demon beasts, and other underground resources are extremely abundant and are a huge natural treasure."<br/>
<br/>
"The more positions we hold in the Lava Immortal Palace, the more cultivation resources we can obtain from it. In fact, it's not just these tangible resources but also merits. Suppressing Fire Persimmon Mountain with the Lava Immortal Palace benefits Fire Persimmon Immortal City and contributes to the Southern Bean Kingdom. These merits are also intangible resources."<br/>
<br/>
"Our Ning family's situation is somewhat awkward. We wandered from the Northern Wind Kingdom to here, and although we've taken root in Fire Persimmon Immortal City for over a decade, in terms of overall strength and status, we are at the bottom among the four major forces. This opportunity is extremely rare, and we may not encounter another one for decades."<br/>
<br/>
"If our Ning family can seize this opportunity, we will surely be able to change the entire situation through the Lava Immortal Palace, enhancing our overall strength, foundation, and status in the Southern Bean Kingdom." Ning Jiufan stroked his beard, "If, according to you, this is a great opportunity, then do you intend to mobilize the entire family to change their cultivation?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head, "Of course not! Our Ning family's specialty lies in cultivating ice and frost-type techniques. This advantage cannot be lost and cannot be changed. In my view, most ordinary cultivators without this ice and frost talent should switch to cultivating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique. In this way, through sheer numbers, we can strive for positions in the Immortal Palace ahead of the Zhou family, Zheng family, and the City Lord's Mansion!"<br/>
<br/>
"As for the future talents of the Ning family, let them continue cultivating their original techniques." Ning Jiufan did not comment.<br/>
<br/>
In his heart, however, he was quite satisfied with Ning Zhuo's response.<br/>
<br/>
Considering that Ning Zhuo was only sixteen years old, this made the Ning family's golden core ancestor even more hopeful for Ning Zhuo's future!<br/>
<br/>
He glanced at Ning Zhuo and said, "I will write to the current family head. Do you think his thoughts will align with yours?" Ning Zhuo immediately exclaimed, "Ancestor, do you still have hope in the main lineage of the Ning family? His answer is predictable; he will surely prioritize the main lineage."<br/>
<br/>
"In my opinion, if we truly want the Ning family to develop better, we must find a new path and establish a new faction. The people of the main lineage have now become a stumbling block for our Ning family to make significant progress. If I could split the family and become the head of a branch, I would surely lead the entire Ning family to new heights!"<br/>
<br/>
This statement earned Ning Zhuo another flick on the forehead from Ning Jiufan. "Always talking about splitting the family. Can you not live without splitting the family? Stop mentioning it!"<br/>
<br/>
In the Ning family estate, within the Ning family's council hall, the head of the Ning family sat in the main seat, with the family elders seated on either side.<br/>
<br/>
The head of the Ning family handed Ning Jiufan's letter to the others.<br/>
<br/>
The elders quickly read it and fell into silence, not saying a word.<br/>
<br/>
The atmosphere in the council hall was quite heavy.<br/>
<br/>
The head of the Ning family sighed deeply and said, "Everyone, share your thoughts." The elder of the War Hall spoke first, "The current situation is quite dire! If we allow the reformation team to secure positions in the Lava Immortal Palace, our family's branch will inevitably receive significant support, making it extremely difficult to control."<br/>
<br/>
"In the future, who will be the branch and who will be the main lineage in our Ning family will be uncertain." The elder of the School Hall agreed, "We rely on controlling techniques to manage the entire clan. But if the cultivators all switch to the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, controlling them through techniques will be impossible."<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he finished speaking, the elder of the Talisman Hall sneered, "You old fools, can't you see the situation clearly?" "On the surface, this is the ancestor asking for our opinion. But in reality, it's just a politely worded letter of persuasion. Can we really refuse?"<br/>
<br/>
"This strategy was discussed by Zhu Xuanji and Meng. It's clear they want to encourage us to compete for positions in the Lava Immortal Palace with all our might, even at the cost of future interests. Our family has no choice but to go all out; there is no second option!"<br/>
<br/>
"The Zhou family and Zheng family will do the same. Whoever holds more positions in the Lava Immortal Palace will have more power on Fire Persimmon Mountain in the future. This is an open strategy! We cannot stop it."<br/>
<br/>
The elder of the School Hall shouted, "But our Ning family's strength lies in ice and frost-type techniques, determined by our innate talent. Now, asking most of our clan to switch to the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique to crazily compete for positions in the Lava Immortal Palace... Isn't this a waste of talent?"<br/>
<br/>
The elder of the Talisman Hall sneered repeatedly, "Our family's specialty is indeed in ice and frost-type techniques, but there's no obstacle to cultivating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique. Moreover, most of our clan members don't have talents like the Ice Jade Hand. The difference between cultivating ice techniques or the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique isn't significant."<br/>
<br/>
"The issue now is not about choosing but about accepting. However, if this trend continues, it will be hard to say who will be the main and who will be secondary in our Ning family in the future!" With these words, the head of the Ning family and the elders fell into silence.<br/>
<br/>
The situation was quite severe for the main lineage of the Ning family! Previously, Ning Zhuo had ousted Ning Xiaohui, uniting a group of former stewards and taking control of the black market overnight.<br/>
<br/>
This heavy blow left the main lineage of the Ning family still reeling.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, Ning Zhuo had already caused a split in the Ning family, with some branch members establishing a new faction in the black market.<br/>
<br/>
The main lineage of the Ning family had not found a way to counter this and had once hoped for support from the City Lord's Mansion and other parties.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo's subsequent handling was excellent, earning praise even from Fei Si, who said he was more sensible than Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
The main lineage of the Ning family could only hope for the future.<br/>
<br/>
After all, it was a consensus among the higher-ups that the black market could not become one of the three controlled by the family.<br/>
<br/>
It was just a special situation at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, the main lineage of the Ning family first encountered this strategy!<br/>
<br/>
This would greatly boost the development of Ning Zhuo's faction! Initially, Ning Zhuo and his group's foundation was in the black market, earning resources for cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Now, because the positions would be retained, the Lava Immortal Palace was likely to become another source of resources for Ning Zhuo's group.<br/>
<br/>
And this time, the strategy of retaining positions in the Lava Immortal Palace had been confirmed by the highest authorities, unlike the black market, which was an unsustainable foundation.<br/>
<br/>
The high-level members of the Ning family had already foreseen this grim future.<br/>
<br/>
However, what left them utterly disheartened was that they were powerless to stop it!</div>
