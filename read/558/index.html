<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">As expected, in the very next moment, Du Tiechuan’s voice thundered across the battlefield:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“All soldiers, heed my command - counterattack with full force! Battle merits will be duly rewarded!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Instantly, a resounding roar echoed from all the troops of Two Note Nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">In contrast, morale on the side of the Thousand Peaks Forest had plummeted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The enemy’s Soul Formation-level expert had already taken action - where was Thousand Peaks Forest’s own?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Countless eyes searched the skies, hoping for the appearance of the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King. But not even a single ginseng whisker was seen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Lu Hongtu shouted loudly:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Do not fear! The enemy is bluffing - Du Tiechuan hasn’t shown up himself!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Uncertainty clouded the soldiers’ expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After a few breaths of time passed with no developments, the fighting across the battlefield slowed. Everyone was waiting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Du Tiechuan’s expression darkened, a hint of wariness flashing through his eyes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Are they trying to bait me into revealing myself first by setting a trap?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Where exactly are you hiding?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Du Tiechuan was already injured. Seizing and sealing Xiang Yue had cost him dearly - his breathing was unsteady, and exerting any further effort was clearly a strain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">No matter how hard he searched, he couldn’t find the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King’s aura or presence. That only made him more apprehensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Under such uncertainty, he dared not risk revealing himself first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Thus, across the entire battlefield - neither side saw any sign of Du Tiechuan appearing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The morale on the side of Thousand Peaks Forest began to stabilize!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“The Grand Cave Lord of Six Caverns Sect sure thinks fast,” Elder Long muttered with admiration as he glanced at Lu Hongtu. As the chief military strategist of the alliance, Lu Hongtu had once again lived up to his title.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Within just a few breaths, Lu Hongtu had already devised a counter-strategy, stabilizing morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Even though Elder Long’s combat power was greater than Lu Hongtu’s, he couldn’t have thought of such a plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">That’s the power of strategy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Suddenly, Shuang Ling threw her head back and burst into sharp laughter. Her piercing voice rang across the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Pointing toward Elder Long, she sneered:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Your so-called Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King still hasn’t appeared! Could it be that he's already succumbed to his injuries and died in secret?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Worthy of the title “Princess of Ingenuity,” she instantly turned the enemy’s tactic back on them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Elder Long’s expression changed drastically. His voice was cold and furious:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Wretched wench! Your vile tongue dares insult our divine lord?! Today I’ll flay your soul and skin, and annihilate you by body and spirit!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Roaring with rage, Elder Long launched a fierce assault on Shuang Ling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Their verbal clash shook both armies, heavily impacting morale on both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Shuang Ling, piloting her Flexible-Bone Mystic Maiden, fought back tenaciously against Elder Long’s furious onslaught. Blow after blow came raining down, and she was steadily pushed back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Yet despite her retreat, Shuang Ling felt a rush of relief. The pressure on her heart lifted by at least half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Previously, she’d been forced to split her focus - fending off Elder Long while also looking for chances to suppress Xiang Yue. The strain had left her physically and mentally exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Although she was one of her nation’s peak Nascent Soul cultivators, handling both Elder Long and Xiang Yue at once had been simply too much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">But now, things had changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">With Du Tiechuan personally taking action, suppressing Xiang Yue on the spot and removing him from the battlefield’s power balance, he freed Shuang Ling to go all-in against Elder Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In truth, it wasn’t just her - the entire army of the Two Note Nation was surging with renewed morale!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The reason was simple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Soul formation-level expert from their side, Du Tiechuan, had finally taken action - and with just one move, he directly suppressed Xiang Yue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">All the damage and pressure Xiang Yue had previously inflicted on the Two Note Nation’s army - this one decisive action instantly restored their morale by just as much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">As a result, a wave of all-out counterattack surged forth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Aaaah!" Xu Dali, bathed in blood, roared wildly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He charged forward with all his might, relying on his powerful Nascent Soul foundation. Applying military tactics, he barreled through all barbarian cultivators in his path - unstoppable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ding Pi’s chef's knife danced in his hands. In an instant, its light glimmered like snow as he executed a pangolin demon cultivator on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The demon’s meat slices flew into a pot and were quickly boiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ding Pi’s apprentice, Jia Wan, pranced around the large pot, expertly adjusting the flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The cooked meat emitted a rich aroma, which Ding Pi then used his spiritual sense to levitate into his mouth. He chewed, swallowed, and transformed it into vast magical power, rapidly replenishing himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Mo Yecheng took a deep breath and activated the formation array on his robes, staining the sky and turning it into a night-like darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The darkness fell like ink, and chains of black rained from the sky, locking down large swathes of enemy troops, rendering them immobile - only to be easily slain by the enemy right before them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Scenes like these erupted all across the battlefield almost simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The rising morale led the soldiers of the Two Note Nation - who had previously been fighting in scattered chaos - to instinctively choose to attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The joint offensive, while not without its failures, largely managed to suppress the Thousand Peaks Forest for the time being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In the past, the troops’ choices weren’t unified. Even when the Thousand Peaks Forest’s forces were pushed back or at a disadvantage, they often managed to quickly counterattack, regaining the upper hand or at least bringing the fight back to even ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">But now, things were different.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Thousand Peaks Forest’s falling morale made their soldiers instinctively uneasy, pushing them into a defensive posture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">One person or even a zone going defensive isn’t enough to change the war. But when everyone collectively chooses defense, the entire battlefield dynamic shifts dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">In almost an instant, the tide clearly turned - the Two Note Nation gained the upper hand, while The Thousand Peaks Forest was forced into retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">And this shift only further amplified the psychological changes happening on both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Two Note Nation soldiers, initially just riding a wave of momentum, now found their attacks landing with ease, realizing, “They really are weaker than before!” Their morale soared even higher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Meanwhile, on The Thousand Peaks Forest’s side, their initial unease and decision to defend seemed validated by the enemy’s sudden ferocity. Their common thought: “See? I was right to play it safe.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">And so, this confirmed the growing belief that the Two Note Nation was strong and The Thousand Peaks Forest was faltering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The army’s will was shaken!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">As one side’s morale rose and the other’s fell, their battle strength shifted too. For solo Nascent Soul cultivators, it didn’t matter much - but the vast majority of troops were only at Foundation Establishment or Golden Core levels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">They made up the bulk of the forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The more The Thousand Peaks Forest fought, the weaker they became. Meanwhile, the Two Note Nation’s troops grew fiercer and more energetic, riding the wave of rising morale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"The human heart is unpredictable," Ning Zhuo murmured at that moment, just having broken away from Xiang Yue. His eyes flashed with understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Our strength hasn't really changed... yet everything changed because of perception. This is the Art of War. Boss, I've got it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Morale, army spirit- </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">For those who follow the path of warfare, for large-scale battles like this, these are such critical factors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Just this one change alone led to a complete reversal of the battle situation! And this change happened almost instantaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Just a moment before, both sides had been evenly matched - even favoring The Thousand Peaks Forest’s side, who were still pressing forward aggressively. But in the very next moment, the counterattack erupted, and The Thousand Peaks Forest’s suddenly found themselves at a clear defensive disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Inside the dragon-head command cabin, Sun Lingtong wore a look of sudden realization and murmured to himself, “Little Thief's Light Breeze Formation… So that’s how it is.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Triggered by this moment, and relying on his extraordinary perception, he instantly grasped the full essence of the battle formation he had previously comprehended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">From this moment on, he had fully understood the Little Thief's Light Breeze Formation - he had completely mastered the core and essence of this formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">He could now once again activate Gao Sheng's Writings and the Shared Helm of Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo, unaware of Sun Lingtong’s state, sent a message via divine sense to him and to the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“This is the perfect chance to launch a counterattack! Let’s go!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Although Liu, Guan, and Zhang had lost their main weapons, they still had their older arms as backups - weapons they were very proficient with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">They led the Three Generals Battalion, forming a triangular arrowhead formation, and charged into the fray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo also deployed his mechanical puppets, reorganizing the army ranks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Sweeping his divine sense over his storage pouch, he discovered he had only a few puppets remaining - so he released them all, slightly surpassing his previous records in troop numbers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He was still under the enhancement of Hero’s Return Technique, which leveraged his strength tremendously. His combat power had risen to a nearly exaggerated level. As such, even though his forces exceeded what he would normally be able to command, he still felt completely at ease managing them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He attempted to deploy the Golden Swallow Mechanisms as well, but quickly retracted them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Controlling two different kinds of mechanical constructs simultaneously was simply too mentally taxing for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Especially for the Golden Swallows - their combat impact was minor, but they dramatically increased the burden on his concentration. The tradeoff just wasn’t worth it, so Ning Zhuo decisively gave up on them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Charge!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He led his mechanical army, flanked by the Three Generals Battalion on both sides, coordinating in an all-out charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Any enemy unit along their path was utterly crushed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sometimes, when Ning Zhuo’s puppet army’s charge was blocked, the Three Generals Battalion would flank the enemy and break through them quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">At other times, Ning Zhuo would support the Three Generals Battalion, throwing his puppets into the fray without regard for losses to break through enemy lines. Once the formation was broken, the three generals would charge at the forefront, leading their battalion in a relentless push, swiftly routing the enemy forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">They rotated through various battle tactics, and the three generals carefully selected their charge targets, avoiding the main forces of The Thousand Peaks Forest. The other factions simply couldn’t compete with their well-organized military structure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">And what Ning Zhuo felt most as he charged through the battlefield was- </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ease!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Yes, ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">With Hero’s Return Technique still empowering him and his final batch of puppets deployed, he was receiving an immense power boost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">From the moment he entered the battlefield until now, he had faced truly formidable opponents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Chen Lingfeng had pushed his innate talent to the limit, reaching peak Golden Core combat strength. Xiang Yue was even a True Lord - a top-tier Nascent Soul powerhouse! In the whole The Thousand Peaks Forest region, he ranked among the top five without a doubt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Fighting such strong opponents, Ning Zhuo had felt heavily pressured, even as his strength continued to rise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">But now, suddenly facing more standard opponents, it was only natural that he felt much more relaxed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Not just relaxed - increasingly relaxed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Once the offensive tide was fully unleashed, it became an overwhelming wave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">And just like a wave, if not suppressed in time, it would continue to roll forward without end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">People like Elder Long and Lu Hongtu understood this perfectly well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">No communication was needed - they all unleashed their strongest combat forms!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Divine Ability - Essence Rejuvenation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The immense life force within Elder Long exploded into furious energy at this very moment, empowering him dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">His height surged to sixteen feet. His entire body bulged with muscle, appearing as if it might burst or tear apart at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Divine Ability - Divine Dragon Body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Semi-transparent dragon scale armor enveloped him from head to toe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ordinary attacks merely caused the dragon scales to vibrate with resonant metallic clangs, incapable of damaging Elder Long's physical form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Spiritual Treasure - Purple Coral Scarlet-Gold Dragon Armor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Elder Long's right shoulder armor was a spiritual treasure, shaped like an open dragon's head, wrapping around his shoulder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Colored in intertwined gold and scarlet, its surface was mirror-smooth, radiating a metallic sheen. The dragon’s eyes sparkled brilliantly, like diamonds or stars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Fine cloud patterns etched upon the armor moved slowly, layer upon layer, shifting endlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">As the spiritual treasure activated, it merged seamlessly with the Divine Dragon Body bestowed by the gods. Instantly, the semi-transparent dragon scale armor solidified, acquiring vibrant scarlet-gold hues, sharply enhancing its defensive capabilities!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">“What?!” Shuang Ling’s expression changed drastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Mystic Bone Maiden’s attack landed on Elder Long, creating only a shower of dazzling sparks. Elder Long himself didn't even sway from the impact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Elder Long’s next words made her heart sink even deeper: “Your true body is hidden over there, isn’t it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">His gaze shifted toward the White Jade Camp, and he charged forward directly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Mystic Bone Lady desperately tried to block him but achieved little.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Elder Long crashed directly into the ranks of the White Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Magical Artifact - Light Mountain, Heavy Mist Painting!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">This was the signature treasure of the Six Caverns Sect, now activated by Lu Hongtu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Mist rapidly emanated from Lu Hongtu’s body, swirling outward to form an ethereal landscape resembling an ink painting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Strangely, the scenery within this ink painting was inverted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Mountains floated upside-down, with ancient, sturdy trees and rugged rocks. Dense mist gathered beneath, exuding an oppressive heaviness, like the weight of mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">“Human and array merged as one?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">“Who knew the master of the Six Caverns Sect possessed such formidable array expertise!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">“Ah-!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Two cultivators of the Two Note Nation that enveloped by the mist were instantly drawn into the ink landscape, hung upside down and torn apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Their lower halves flew skyward, smashed into pulp on the rocky peaks. Their upper halves plummeted into the clouds below, ground into powder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Jin Tunhe, a demon cultivator clad in loose robes decorated with coin symbols, revealed his true form - a massive, three-legged golden toad towering forty feet high, his back piled with coins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Jin Tunhe opened his mouth wide, inhaling vast quantities of nearby objects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">“My flying sword!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">“Damn it! Return my artifact!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Everyone exclaimed in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">“My clothes! Give me back my clothes!!” Some had it even worse, instantly stripped bare, desperately covering their lower bodies. The smarter ones covered their faces directly, fleeing in embarrassment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Jin Tunhe blocked Ning Zhuo and the Three Generals Battalion's path of charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ning Zhuo's mechanical puppets were swept up by a fierce wind and sucked into the mouth of the Three-legged Golden Toad, instantly losing their connection with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Ning Zhuo's expression changed abruptly, a faint fear gripping his heart. He realized that losing these mechanical puppets hadn’t given him any boost whatsoever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“This method precisely counters my Hero's Return Technique!” Ning Zhuo exclaimed in astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">There were no strongest spells, only strongest cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Everything in the world had mutual reinforcement and restraint; this was the principle of natural balance. Ning Zhuo’s Hero's Return Technique, which he had always relied on, naturally had its moment of being countered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">That moment, however, had come sooner than expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Not only Ning Zhuo, but even many soldiers from the Three Generals Battalion saw their weapons and armor sucked into the belly of the Three-legged Golden Toad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">“I’ll crush it with my bare hands!” Zhang Hei roared furiously, having lost his magical treasure and even the armor covering his upper body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">“No!” Ning Zhuo immediately discouraged him. “Jin Tunhe is at the Nascent Soul stage, at his strongest right now. There's no need to clash head-on. No matter how much he absorbs, his belly space is limited.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">“We’ll detour first, killing as many enemy cultivators as possible!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Liu Er promptly responded, “The strategist is right!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Zhang Hei and Guan Hong readily obeyed.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
