<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 558: The Counterattack Surges</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
As expected, in the very next moment, Du Tiechuan’s voice thundered across the battlefield:<br/>
<br/>
“All soldiers, heed my command - counterattack with full force! Battle merits will be duly rewarded!”<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, a resounding roar echoed from all the troops of Twin Rivers Nation.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, morale on the side of the Thousand Peaks Forest had plummeted.<br/>
<br/>
The enemy’s Soul Formation-level expert had already taken action - where was Thousand Peaks Forest’s own?<br/>
<br/>
Countless eyes searched the skies, hoping for the appearance of the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King. But not even a single ginseng whisker was seen.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu shouted loudly:<br/>
<br/>
“Do not fear! The enemy is bluffing - Du Tiechuan hasn’t shown up himself!”<br/>
<br/>
Uncertainty clouded the soldiers’ expressions.<br/>
<br/>
After a few breaths of time passed with no developments, the fighting across the battlefield slowed. Everyone was waiting.<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan’s expression darkened, a hint of wariness flashing through his eyes:<br/>
<br/>
“Are they trying to bait me into revealing myself first by setting a trap?”<br/>
<br/>
“Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King…”<br/>
<br/>
“Where exactly are you hiding?”<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan was already injured. Seizing and sealing Xiang Yue had cost him dearly - his breathing was unsteady, and exerting any further effort was clearly a strain.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how hard he searched, he couldn’t find the Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King’s aura or presence. That only made him more apprehensive.<br/>
<br/>
Under such uncertainty, he dared not risk revealing himself first.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, across the entire battlefield - neither side saw any sign of Du Tiechuan appearing.<br/>
<br/>
The morale on the side of Thousand Peaks Forest began to stabilize!<br/>
<br/>
“The Grand Cave Lord of Six Caverns Sect sure thinks fast,” Elder Long muttered with admiration as he glanced at Lu Hongtu. As the chief military strategist of the alliance, Lu Hongtu had once again lived up to his title.<br/>
<br/>
Within just a few breaths, Lu Hongtu had already devised a counter-strategy, stabilizing morale.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Elder Long’s combat power was greater than Lu Hongtu’s, he couldn’t have thought of such a plan.<br/>
<br/>
That’s the power of strategy!<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Shuang Ling threw her head back and burst into sharp laughter. Her piercing voice rang across the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Pointing toward Elder Long, she sneered:<br/>
<br/>
“Your so-called Ginseng-Whiskered Dragon King still hasn’t appeared! Could it be that he's already succumbed to his injuries and died in secret?”<br/>
<br/>
Worthy of the title “Princess of Ingenuity,” she instantly turned the enemy’s tactic back on them.<br/>
<br/>
Elder Long’s expression changed drastically. His voice was cold and furious:<br/>
<br/>
“Wretched wench! Your vile tongue dares insult our divine lord?! Today I’ll flay your soul and skin, and annihilate you by body and spirit!”<br/>
<br/>
Roaring with rage, Elder Long launched a fierce assault on Shuang Ling.<br/>
<br/>
Their verbal clash shook both armies, heavily impacting morale on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling, piloting her Flexible-Bone Mystic Maiden, fought back tenaciously against Elder Long’s furious onslaught. Blow after blow came raining down, and she was steadily pushed back.<br/>
<br/>
Yet despite her retreat, Shuang Ling felt a rush of relief. The pressure on her heart lifted by at least half.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, she’d been forced to split her focus - fending off Elder Long while also looking for chances to suppress Xiang Yue. The strain had left her physically and mentally exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Although she was one of her nation’s peak Nascent Soul cultivators, handling both Elder Long and Xiang Yue at once had been simply too much.<br/>
<br/>
But now, things had changed.<br/>
<br/>
With Du Tiechuan personally taking action, suppressing Xiang Yue on the spot and removing him from the battlefield’s power balance, he freed Shuang Ling to go all-in against Elder Long.<br/>
<br/>
In truth, it wasn’t just her - the entire army of the Twin Rivers Nation was surging with renewed morale!<br/>
<br/>
The reason was simple.<br/>
<br/>
The Soul formation-level expert from their side, Du Tiechuan, had finally taken action - and with just one move, he directly suppressed Xiang Yue.<br/>
<br/>
All the damage and pressure Xiang Yue had previously inflicted on the Twin Rivers Nation’s army - this one decisive action instantly restored their morale by just as much.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, a wave of all-out counterattack surged forth!<br/>
<br/>
"Aaaah!" Xu Dali, bathed in blood, roared wildly.<br/>
<br/>
He charged forward with all his might, relying on his powerful Nascent Soul foundation. Applying military tactics, he barreled through all barbarian cultivators in his path - unstoppable!<br/>
<br/>
Ding Pi’s chef's knife danced in his hands. In an instant, its light glimmered like snow as he executed a pangolin demon cultivator on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
The demon’s meat slices flew into a pot and were quickly boiled.<br/>
<br/>
Ding Pi’s apprentice, Jia Wan, pranced around the large pot, expertly adjusting the flame.<br/>
<br/>
The cooked meat emitted a rich aroma, which Ding Pi then used his spiritual sense to levitate into his mouth. He chewed, swallowed, and transformed it into vast magical power, rapidly replenishing himself.<br/>
<br/>
Mo Yecheng took a deep breath and activated the formation array on his robes, staining the sky and turning it into a night-like darkness.<br/>
<br/>
The darkness fell like ink, and chains of black rained from the sky, locking down large swathes of enemy troops, rendering them immobile - only to be easily slain by the enemy right before them.<br/>
<br/>
Scenes like these erupted all across the battlefield almost simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
The rising morale led the soldiers of the Twin Rivers Nation - who had previously been fighting in scattered chaos - to instinctively choose to attack.<br/>
<br/>
The joint offensive, while not without its failures, largely managed to suppress the Thousand Peaks Forest for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, the troops’ choices weren’t unified. Even when the Thousand Peaks Forest’s forces were pushed back or at a disadvantage, they often managed to quickly counterattack, regaining the upper hand or at least bringing the fight back to even ground.<br/>
<br/>
But now, things were different.<br/>
<br/>
The Thousand Peaks Forest’s falling morale made their soldiers instinctively uneasy, pushing them into a defensive posture.<br/>
<br/>
One person or even a zone going defensive isn’t enough to change the war. But when everyone collectively chooses defense, the entire battlefield dynamic shifts dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
In almost an instant, the tide clearly turned - the Twin Rivers Nation gained the upper hand, while The Thousand Peaks Forest was forced into retreat.<br/>
<br/>
And this shift only further amplified the psychological changes happening on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
The Twin Rivers Nation soldiers, initially just riding a wave of momentum, now found their attacks landing with ease, realizing, “They really are weaker than before!” Their morale soared even higher.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, on The Thousand Peaks Forest’s side, their initial unease and decision to defend seemed validated by the enemy’s sudden ferocity. Their common thought: “See? I was right to play it safe.”<br/>
<br/>
And so, this confirmed the growing belief that the Twin Rivers Nation was strong and The Thousand Peaks Forest was faltering.<br/>
<br/>
The army’s will was shaken!<br/>
<br/>
As one side’s morale rose and the other’s fell, their battle strength shifted too. For solo Nascent Soul cultivators, it didn’t matter much - but the vast majority of troops were only at Foundation Establishment or Golden Core levels.<br/>
<br/>
They made up the bulk of the forces.<br/>
<br/>
The more The Thousand Peaks Forest fought, the weaker they became. Meanwhile, the Twin Rivers Nation’s troops grew fiercer and more energetic, riding the wave of rising morale.<br/>
<br/>
"The human heart is unpredictable," Ning Zhuo murmured at that moment, just having broken away from Xiang Yue. His eyes flashed with understanding.<br/>
<br/>
"Our strength hasn't really changed... yet everything changed because of perception. This is the Art of War. Boss, I've got it!"<br/>
<br/>
Morale, army spirit- <br/>
<br/>
For those who follow the path of warfare, for large-scale battles like this, these are such critical factors.<br/>
<br/>
Just this one change alone led to a complete reversal of the battle situation! And this change happened almost instantaneously.<br/>
<br/>
Just a moment before, both sides had been evenly matched - even favoring The Thousand Peaks Forest’s side, who were still pressing forward aggressively. But in the very next moment, the counterattack erupted, and The Thousand Peaks Forest’s suddenly found themselves at a clear defensive disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the dragon-head command cabin, Sun Lingtong wore a look of sudden realization and murmured to himself, “Thief's Gentle Breeze Formation… So that’s how it is.”<br/>
<br/>
Triggered by this moment, and relying on his extraordinary perception, he instantly grasped the full essence of the battle formation he had previously comprehended.<br/>
<br/>
From this moment on, he had fully understood the Thief’s Gentle Breeze Formation - he had completely mastered the core and essence of this formation.<br/>
<br/>
He could now once again activate Gao Sheng's Writings and the Shared Helm of Generals.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, unaware of Sun Lingtong’s state, sent a message via divine sense to him and to the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang:<br/>
<br/>
“This is the perfect chance to launch a counterattack! Let’s go!”<br/>
<br/>
Although Liu, Guan, and Zhang had lost their main weapons, they still had their older arms as backups - weapons they were very proficient with.<br/>
<br/>
They led the Three Generals Battalion, forming a triangular arrowhead formation, and charged into the fray.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also deployed his mechanical puppets, reorganizing the army ranks.<br/>
<br/>
Sweeping his divine sense over his storage pouch, he discovered he had only a few puppets remaining - so he released them all, slightly surpassing his previous records in troop numbers.<br/>
<br/>
He was still under the enhancement of Hero’s Return Technique, which leveraged his strength tremendously. His combat power had risen to a nearly exaggerated level. As such, even though his forces exceeded what he would normally be able to command, he still felt completely at ease managing them.<br/>
<br/>
He attempted to deploy the Golden Swallow Mechanisms as well, but quickly retracted them.<br/>
<br/>
Controlling two different kinds of mechanical constructs simultaneously was simply too mentally taxing for him.<br/>
<br/>
Especially for the Golden Swallows - their combat impact was minor, but they dramatically increased the burden on his concentration. The tradeoff just wasn’t worth it, so Ning Zhuo decisively gave up on them.<br/>
<br/>
“Charge!”<br/>
<br/>
He led his mechanical army, flanked by the Three Generals Battalion on both sides, coordinating in an all-out charge.<br/>
<br/>
Any enemy unit along their path was utterly crushed.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when Ning Zhuo’s puppet army’s charge was blocked, the Three Generals Battalion would flank the enemy and break through them quickly.<br/>
<br/>
At other times, Ning Zhuo would support the Three Generals Battalion, throwing his puppets into the fray without regard for losses to break through enemy lines. Once the formation was broken, the three generals would charge at the forefront, leading their battalion in a relentless push, swiftly routing the enemy forces.<br/>
<br/>
They rotated through various battle tactics, and the three generals carefully selected their charge targets, avoiding the main forces of The Thousand Peaks Forest. The other factions simply couldn’t compete with their well-organized military structure.<br/>
<br/>
And what Ning Zhuo felt most as he charged through the battlefield was- <br/>
<br/>
Ease!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, ease.<br/>
<br/>
With Hero’s Return Technique still empowering him and his final batch of puppets deployed, he was receiving an immense power boost.<br/>
<br/>
From the moment he entered the battlefield until now, he had faced truly formidable opponents.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng had pushed his innate talent to the limit, reaching peak Golden Core combat strength. Xiang Yue was even a True Lord - a top-tier Nascent Soul powerhouse! In the whole The Thousand Peaks Forest region, he ranked among the top five without a doubt.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting such strong opponents, Ning Zhuo had felt heavily pressured, even as his strength continued to rise.<br/>
<br/>
But now, suddenly facing more standard opponents, it was only natural that he felt much more relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
Not just relaxed - increasingly relaxed!<br/>
<br/>
Once the offensive tide was fully unleashed, it became an overwhelming wave.<br/>
<br/>
And just like a wave, if not suppressed in time, it would continue to roll forward without end.<br/>
<br/>
People like Elder Long and Lu Hongtu understood this perfectly well.<br/>
<br/>
No communication was needed - they all unleashed their strongest combat forms!<br/>
<br/>
Divine Ability - Essence Rejuvenation!<br/>
<br/>
The immense life force within Elder Long exploded into furious energy at this very moment, empowering him dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
His height surged to sixteen feet. His entire body bulged with muscle, appearing as if it might burst or tear apart at any moment.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Ability - Divine Dragon Body!<br/>
<br/>
Semi-transparent dragon scale armor enveloped him from head to toe.<br/>
<br/>
Ordinary attacks merely caused the dragon scales to vibrate with resonant metallic clangs, incapable of damaging Elder Long's physical form.<br/>
<br/>
Spiritual Treasure - Purple Coral Scarlet-Gold Dragon Armor!<br/>
<br/>
Elder Long's right shoulder armor was a spiritual treasure, shaped like an open dragon's head, wrapping around his shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
Colored in intertwined gold and scarlet, its surface was mirror-smooth, radiating a metallic sheen. The dragon’s eyes sparkled brilliantly, like diamonds or stars.<br/>
<br/>
Fine cloud patterns etched upon the armor moved slowly, layer upon layer, shifting endlessly.<br/>
<br/>
As the spiritual treasure activated, it merged seamlessly with the Divine Dragon Body bestowed by the gods. Instantly, the semi-transparent dragon scale armor solidified, acquiring vibrant scarlet-gold hues, sharply enhancing its defensive capabilities!<br/>
<br/>
“What?!” Shuang Ling’s expression changed drastically.<br/>
<br/>
Mystic Bone Maiden’s attack landed on Elder Long, creating only a shower of dazzling sparks. Elder Long himself didn't even sway from the impact.<br/>
<br/>
Elder Long’s next words made her heart sink even deeper: “Your true body is hidden over there, isn’t it?”<br/>
<br/>
His gaze shifted toward the White Jade Camp, and he charged forward directly!<br/>
<br/>
Mystic Bone Lady desperately tried to block him but achieved little.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Elder Long crashed directly into the ranks of the White Jade Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Magical Artifact - Light Mountain, Heavy Mist Painting!<br/>
<br/>
This was the signature treasure of the Six Caverns Sect, now activated by Lu Hongtu.<br/>
<br/>
Mist rapidly emanated from Lu Hongtu’s body, swirling outward to form an ethereal landscape resembling an ink painting.<br/>
<br/>
Strangely, the scenery within this ink painting was inverted.<br/>
<br/>
Mountains floated upside-down, with ancient, sturdy trees and rugged rocks. Dense mist gathered beneath, exuding an oppressive heaviness, like the weight of mountains.<br/>
<br/>
“Human and array merged as one?!”<br/>
<br/>
“Who knew the master of the Six Caverns Sect possessed such formidable array expertise!”<br/>
<br/>
“Ah-!”<br/>
<br/>
Two cultivators of the Twin Rivers Nation that enveloped by the mist were instantly drawn into the ink landscape, hung upside down and torn apart.<br/>
<br/>
Their lower halves flew skyward, smashed into pulp on the rocky peaks. Their upper halves plummeted into the clouds below, ground into powder.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Tunhe, a demon cultivator clad in loose robes decorated with coin symbols, revealed his true form - a massive, three-legged golden toad towering forty feet high, his back piled with coins.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Tunhe opened his mouth wide, inhaling vast quantities of nearby objects.<br/>
<br/>
“My flying sword!”<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it! Return my artifact!”<br/>
<br/>
Everyone exclaimed in shock.<br/>
<br/>
“My clothes! Give me back my clothes!!” Some had it even worse, instantly stripped bare, desperately covering their lower bodies. The smarter ones covered their faces directly, fleeing in embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Tunhe blocked Ning Zhuo and the Three Generals Battalion's path of charge.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's mechanical puppets were swept up by a fierce wind and sucked into the mouth of the Three-legged Golden Toad, instantly losing their connection with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's expression changed abruptly, a faint fear gripping his heart. He realized that losing these mechanical puppets hadn’t given him any boost whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
“This method precisely counters my Warrior's Return Technique!” Ning Zhuo exclaimed in astonishment.<br/>
<br/>
There were no strongest spells, only strongest cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Everything in the world had mutual reinforcement and restraint; this was the principle of natural balance. Ning Zhuo’s Warrior’s Return Technique, which he had always relied on, naturally had its moment of being countered.<br/>
<br/>
That moment, however, had come sooner than expected.<br/>
<br/>
Not only Ning Zhuo, but even many soldiers from the Three Generals Battalion saw their weapons and armor sucked into the belly of the Three-legged Golden Toad.<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll crush it with my bare hands!” Zhang Hei roared furiously, having lost his magical treasure and even the armor covering his upper body.<br/>
<br/>
“No!” Ning Zhuo immediately discouraged him. “Jin Tunhe is at the Nascent Soul stage, at his strongest right now. There's no need to clash head-on. No matter how much he absorbs, his belly space is limited.”<br/>
<br/>
“We’ll detour first, killing as many enemy cultivators as possible!”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er promptly responded, “The strategist is right!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei and Guan Hong readily obeyed.</div>
