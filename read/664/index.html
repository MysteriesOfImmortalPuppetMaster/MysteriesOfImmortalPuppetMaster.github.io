<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Die, you wretch!" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's face twitched, his murderous intent almost solidifying into a tangible force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Splash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In that critical moment, Qing Chi, without hesitation, plunged into the Wangchuan River like a moth drawn to a flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The instant she touched the water, vibrant, multicolored smoke erupted from her body, as if a dye vat had overturned or a glazed dreamscape had shattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Each wisp of smoke that rose and shifted reflected vivid, warm memories of her past. Yet these radiant moments of her life were mercilessly dispersed and extinguished by the icy river water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Unlike Ning Zhuo, Qing Chi possessed no protective treasures and stood no chance against the Wangchuan River's relentless currents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Qing Chi!" Ning Zhuo's heart jolted at the sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"No matter who you are, I'll save you!" Qing Chi had completely forgotten Ning Zhuo's identity, but the intense emotions burning within her, deep in her bones, as scorching as molten lava, drove her to risk her life for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">She dove deeper, swimming toward Ning Zhuo with all her might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Nether Dragon Scissors, encased in a thin Ice Coffin, hurtled toward Ning Zhuo, but Qing Chi intercepted them at the last possible moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The massive impact forced Qing Chi's mouth open, and she spat out a mouthful of scalding blood that stained the icy river water a ghastly scarlet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">As the river water flooded her mouth and body, it seemed to unlock the floodgates of her memories. Vast plumes of colorful mist erupted from her entire body, dissipating wildly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Ice Coffin, still bearing the injured Qing Chi, slammed into Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Driven by the ferocious force of the Nether Dragon Scissors, the two figures and the coffin were violently propelled through the depths of the Wangchuan River's branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Wherever they went, trails of five-colored mist and blood streamed behind them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Damn it," Luo Si thought, his heart sinking. He was completely immobilized, only his eyes visible through the clay covering his face. He could only watch helplessly as everything spiraled toward the abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Qing Chi!" Ning Zhuo cried out inwardly, pressing his hand firmly against her back to share the power of the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Buddhist Light enveloped Qing Chi's body and soul, abruptly slowing the torrent of memories and emotions being washed away. But it wasn't enough!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Is it because she opened her mouth earlier, and Forgetful River Water is still inside her?" Ning Zhuo thought frantically, desperate for a solution. He was already straining to maintain the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, pushing himself to his absolute limit. Now, diverting his energy to save her was pushing him beyond his capabilities!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Heh, a desperate struggle," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord sneered, his murderous intent blazing. "Nether Dragon Scissors, pierce them through!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Nether Dragon Scissors trembled violently, its razor-sharp tips piercing through the final layer of thin ice and plunging directly into Qing Chi's abdomen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Blood gushed forth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Ugh... ah...!" Qing Chi gasped, a broken whimper escaping her lips from the searing pain. Driven by instinct, she instinctively clasped her hands together, gripping the cold scissor blades that had pierced her body with a death grip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Blood spurted between her fingers, seeping through the gaps and sliding down the scissor blades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Qing Chi felt only pain, her mind consumed by the safety of the person behind her. She was determined to use every last ounce of strength to prevent this deadly weapon from harming him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Under the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's distant command, the Nether Dragon Scissors cruelly advanced again, plunging deeper into Qing Chi's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Qing Chi strained against the scissors' relentless thrust, but how could her strength possibly match that of a National Artifact?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo pressed tightly against Qing Chi's back, feeling the flame of her life rapidly flickering out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Ghost Clan Girl was sacrificing her life to create a fragile shield for him. She was willingly acting as a human shield, dying for him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"No, Qing Chi! Wait for me!!" Ning Zhuo's eyes were bloodshot, his face contorted with rage. He frantically squeezed every last ounce of potential from his dantian, Sea of Consciousness, and Soul, channeling it into activating...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Divine Art: Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">An invisible thread had already connected them. Through this lifeline, he transmitted his message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But Qing Chi showed no reaction whatsoever. Her expression was blank, her eyes hollow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The loss of so many memories and emotions had rendered her unresponsive. She had even forgotten the dire straits they were in, driven solely by her fierce love for Ning Zhuo, determined to protect him at all costs, even if it meant sacrificing herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo nearly ground his teeth to dust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Since Qing Chi couldn't cooperate actively, he steeled his resolve and decided to use Life Hanging by a Thread to try and manipulate her movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">At least to shift her position. Otherwise, Ning Zhuo wouldn't even be able to reach the Nether Dragon Scissors' True Form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Nether Dragon Scissors had nearly breached the Ice Coffin. Thirty percent of the blades had already pierced Qing Chi's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Forcing its way through her, the scissors plunged deeper with each thrust, moving as swiftly as a shooting star through the raging currents of the Branch of the Wangchuan River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Branch of the Wangchuan River coiled in a loop, trapping the trio, the coffin, and the scissors in an endless cycle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo clung to Qing Chi's back, desperately maintaining the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. He could only muster a sliver of strength to attempt adjustments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">As the arrowhead, positioned at the very front, Ning Zhuo bore the full brunt of the water's crushing pressure. He felt as if a mountain were pressing down on him, making even the slightest movement feel like scaling the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He tried repeatedly, but his strength proved insufficient to activate his Divine Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">One of Luo Si's eyes had already been obscured by clay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Qing Chi's body grew increasingly cold. The excessive blood loss and severe injuries had disrupted her internal balance, allowing Death Qi to permeate her, suffocating her life force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Ghost Clan Girl's life flickered like a candle in the wind, threatening to extinguish at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"No, Qing Chi, hold on! Wait for me! Wait for me!" Ning Zhuo's eyes burned crimson, his expression twisted in anguish, yet his attempts continued to fail. A crushing sense of helplessness threatened to overwhelm him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Little Ma... Little Ma..." Qing Chi's face was numb, her lips moving slightly as she whispered weakly, her voice as faint as a mosquito's buzz, yet each syllable tore at Ning Zhuo's heart. With each repetition, another precious fragment of memory was stripped from the depths of her soul, dissolving into colorful smoke and vanishing into the current.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo, standing behind her, quickly warned, "Don't speak! We're in the Forgetful River!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But Qing Chi seemed not to hear him, or perhaps she was reminding herself not to forget: "Little Ma, Little Ma..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Her voice grew fainter and more ethereal, as if coming from the distant heavens. Her eyes rolled back, and her consciousness sank completely into the chaotic darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In the final moments of her life, an indescribable power suddenly erupted from her broken body!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">It was her Innate Talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Azure Flame!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">A cyan flame burst forth from her body, instantly engulfing her entirely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Her blood, stained by the Azure Flame, ignited with a whoosh, burning fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The azure flames defied the Forgetful River Water, not only refusing to be extinguished but burning even more intensely!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo, pressed close behind her, was also enveloped by the Azure Flame. His face and form seemed to melt away as his disguise dissolved, revealing his true appearance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Luo Si, with his remaining eye, witnessed this scene, his pupil shrinking violently. The immense mystery that had haunted his mind suddenly unraveled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He finally understood the misunderstanding. His lord had merely been disguised as another person - the very reason the Fishing Technique had failed to work!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The person Qing Chi had risked her life to save was not the "Little Ma" who haunted her dreams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">From the beginning, this had been a futile endeavor, a misplaced devotion, a tragedy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">It was like Yunxiao trying to reclaim Yueyi, with only the Forgetful Crossing and an empty boat left behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"General Qing..." Even Luo Si couldn't help but let out a heavy sigh from the depths of his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Whoosh!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Azure Flame blazed fiercely, engulfing the entire branch of the Wangchuan River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The Nether Dragon Scissors, carrying Qing Chi, sped through the water, circling countless times. The branch of the Wangchuan River was already stained crimson with Qing Chi's blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Her blood was burning!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This was the final cry of her life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Little Ma... Little Ma... Little..." Her voice rapidly weakened until she no longer called out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">She had forgotten the name etched into her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Yet the love within her still surged, driving her to protect the person behind her at all costs!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">As if in response, azure flames flowed across the Nether Dragon Scissors, etching blood-stained patterns into their surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was aghast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"What... what kind of fire is this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Forgetful River Water couldn't extinguish it; the flames burned freely beneath the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Even more baffling and terrifying was the rapidly diminishing connection between him and the Nether Dragon Scissors - Qing Chi was forcibly blood-refining them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The azure flames surged, scorching the Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Snap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">With a faint sound, the Divine Technique: Life Hanging by a Thread was severed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Pfft!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"The Divine Art has been broken?!" Ning Zhuo's heart convulsed violently. Struck by the backlash, he coughed up a mouthful of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Damn it!!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This was the first time he had suffered the backlash from a failed Divine Art, and the force was overwhelming. Caught off guard, Ning Zhuo's body and soul were severely injured, his three seas trembled, and he instantly collapsed into darkness, losing consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Without his control over the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, the Precious Seal became like water without a source, its Buddhist Light rapidly dimming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Once the protective Buddhist Light barrier collapsed, Ning Zhuo, submerged in the river, would be washed away, inevitably losing all his memories and emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Don't forget, his physical body is submerged in the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">When the time comes, he will undoubtedly die!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Yet even unconscious, his hand remained clenched tightly around the Heavenly Ghost Skull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Under the searing Azure Flame, the skull began to melt in an impossible manner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Heavenly Ghost Skull gradually dissolved into a pool of deep blue liquid, as profound as the night sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This liquid was absorbed by Ning Zhuo's palm, seeping into his body, permeating his bones and sinews, until it reached his divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Innate Talent - True Self!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">A brilliant azure light erupted from Ning Zhuo's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Though the Azure Flame continued to burn, it couldn't contain this soaring blue radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Simultaneously, the Nether Dragon Scissors, covered in blood-refining runes, completely severed its connection to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. The scissors transformed into a streak of light, willingly merging into Qing Chi's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Pfft - !!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">At that moment, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord threw his head back and violently spat out a mouthful of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Blood splattered five feet!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">His hair snapped apart inch by inch, his Qi plummeted to its lowest point, as if his spine had been ripped out. He fell backward stiffly, collapsing into unconsciousness on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Luo Si's vision gradually filled with yellow earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">In the last sliver of fading light, he faintly saw a white-robed youth emerge from the branch of the river, cradling a Ghost Clan Girl in his arms. Behind the youth, the Branch of the Wangchuan River was being relentlessly scorched by Azure Flames, nearly dried up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Luo Si felt as though he had sunk into the Forgetful River himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Wake up! Wake up now!" His resolute consciousness urged him relentlessly, feeling like a grain of sand at the riverbed, struggling upward bit by bit, with agonizing effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Hah... hah..." He finally managed a faint, gasping breath, forcing his eyes open with immense difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">His eyelids felt as heavy as if they had been welded shut, and his narrow field of vision was blurred and gloomy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Clop... clop...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The clear, forceful, and coldly rhythmic sound of horseshoes striking the ground reached his ears, mingled with the creaking of cartwheels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Luo Si is awake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Lord Ningzhuo, Luo Si is awake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Luo Si immediately heard someone shouting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Soon, a white-robed figure rushed into his field of vision and helped him sit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The white-robed figure cast a spell on Luo Si, clearing his vision and accelerating the restoration of his physical senses. A warm current flowed through his body, transforming into strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">He slowly turned his head, shifting his gaze to survey his surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He was lying on a crude mechanical cart with two massive wooden wheels spinning wildly. The cart was being pulled by two Black Blood Paper Horses, galloping at full speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Resting on Luo Si's abdomen was an octagonal palace lantern, the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">It was this lantern, by regulating and channeling Earth Qi, that had gradually freed Luo Si from the heavy clay seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo smiled. "It's good you're awake. You can now circulate your spiritual energy to accelerate your recovery. I'll lend you this lantern for now; it will greatly help you expel the Earth Qi from your body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Young Master," Luo Si rasped, his throat parched. He managed to utter only those two words before his strength failed him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo nodded. "I know what you want to ask."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Using his divine sense, he transmitted to Luo Si what had transpired after he lost consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The Azure Flame had melted the Heavenly Ghost Skull, allowing Ning Zhuo to absorb its Acquired Talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">This Innate Talent of Self ensured Ning Zhuo's constant awareness of his true self, perfectly countering the effects of the Forgetful River Water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">No longer needing to fully maintain the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Ning Zhuo remained unharmed even as the river's branch surged around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">This newfound power enabled him to escape the Forgetful River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Qing Chi had unexpectedly refined the Nether Dragon Scissors, then collapsed unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo carried Qing Chi out of the river's branch to rescue Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Though he couldn't immediately free Luo Si, he had done his utmost to protect his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">After hastily clearing the battlefield, fearing the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord might personally lead reinforcements, Ning Zhuo fled the Altar Battlefield with Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">After descending to the ground, Ning Zhuo revealed his true appearance and summoned the Qing-Jiao Army. He informed them of his true identity and provided a general overview of the battle, omitting the fact that he had absorbed the Innate Talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Upon learning of their victory and the disruption of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme, the Qing-Jiao Army's morale soared, and they erupted in cheers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Jiao Ma's biological father, however, felt endless regret. He had long suspected that the person claiming to be his son was an imposter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo's voluntary confession left the Jiao Clan in shock and suspicion. Qing Chi's comatose state also weighed heavily on the Qing Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Jiao Ma's biological father stepped forward first, immediately declaring his support for Ning Zhuo. His decision quickly garnered the unanimous backing of the entire Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">With the Qing-Jiao Army under his command, Ning Zhuo led them toward their agreed-upon rendezvous point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Upon arriving, Ning Zhuo found neither Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin nor Sun Lingtong, though Luo Si was now able to walk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">There, he discovered a Flying Letter delivered by Meng Yaoyin. The letter instructed Ning Zhuo that if she hadn't arrived after an extended period, he should lead the army to Water Burial Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Reading the letter, Luo Si felt a sudden sense of foreboding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The Ash Bone Elder had shown him great kindness, and he had always yearned to repay him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ning Zhuo and Luo Si, carrying the still-unconscious Qing Chi, immediately set off for Water Burial Valley without stopping.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
