<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">This premonition was baseless, and Ning Zhuo himself found it quite strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Undoubtedly, this heightened his vigilance toward Ban Ji. After some deliberation, he first drafted a polite but firm reply, subtly declining Ban Ji's invitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Then, he summoned Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"At your command, Young Master," Gongsun Yan said, cupping his hands in a respectful bow. "What are your orders?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Investigate someone for me," Ning Zhuo instructed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He handed Gongsun Yan Ban Ji's invitation letter, his own reply, and a pouch of Spirit Stones to cover expenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Carrying Ning Zhuo's reply, Gongsun Yan followed the path of the Flying Message until he reached a mountain peak. There, he stood before a cave dwelling, presenting Ning Zhuo's reply as a request to be admitted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The cave dwelling opened, and Gongsun Yan was ushered inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Within the cave, a small banquet was in progress. Music, dance, fine cuisine, and exquisite wines filled the air with a lively atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The hosts of the banquet were Pi Fujie and Ban Ji, the guest of honor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Pi Fujie, his hair as gray as ash and his eyes sunken deep like a skull's, still wore his wide, leather-stitched robe. Yet his expression was no longer arrogant; instead, he wore a forced smile as he whispered to Ban Ji beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Gongsun Yan knew of Pi Fujie - Ning Zhuo made sure his subordinates were aware of his enemies. Understanding the man’s hostility, he remained expressionless and unafraid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">When the Flying Message, guided by Qi, flew directly to Ban Ji, Gongsun Yan scrutinized the man closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ban Ji appeared youthful, with a sallow complexion, slightly prominent cheekbones, a hooked nose like an eagle's beak, and thin, tightly pursed lips that conveyed both harshness and greed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Lean and wiry, neither tall nor short, he had unusually long arms and a neck that jutted forward sharply. Seated, he resembled a vulture poised to strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Gongsun Yan bowed respectfully to Pi Fujie and Ban Ji in turn, conveying Ning Zhuo's intentions with neither arrogance nor subservience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ban Ji sat cross-legged, one hand gripping a wine cup and the other resting on his knee. He didn't look up until Gongsun Yan finished speaking, finally shifting his gaze from the cup to the visitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Only then did Gongsun Yan notice Ban Ji's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The whites were unusually prominent, and the pupils were murky amber, like two pieces of aged amber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ban Ji chuckled, a hint of arrogance in his tone. "You’re quite attendant. How long have you been following Ning Zhuo? Were you assigned to him because he’s joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Gongsun Yan clasped his hands in a respectful bow and explained the truth: he had originally been a guest elder of the Lin Clan, assisting Lin Jinglong in joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect, and had only recently sworn allegiance to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ban Ji's expression remained impassive as he rotated his wine cup between his fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Though inwardly surprised, he maintained a calm demeanor. "Oh? The Lin Clan is quite reputable. How much did Ning Zhuo offer to make you abandon Lin Jinglong?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Gongsun Yan shook his head slightly. "That is not for outsiders to know."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ban Ji chuckled softly. Just moments earlier, his divine sense had scanned Ning Zhuo's reply, confirming his refusal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">With a wave of his arm, Ban Ji declared, "Very well, I've received the message. Since Ning Zhuo is unavailable, we'll wait for a more opportune time to schedule our spar."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Pi Fujie, standing nearby, frowned slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He had deliberately cultivated a relationship with Ban Ji, presenting him with lavish gifts. Though Ban Ji had accepted and sent the spar invitation, he immediately withdrew after Ning Zhuo's refusal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Pi Fujie took a sullen sip of wine, watching Gongsun Yan depart. Just as he was about to speak to Ban Ji, the latter preemptively said, "Fellow Daoist Pi, please remain calm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"As the saying goes, 'One doesn't strike a smiling face.' Ning Zhuo's reply was tactful and courteous, not a complete rejection, merely claiming he was currently occupied."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"With this letter in hand, I can't publicly accuse Ning Zhuo of cowardice or tarnishing his reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Pi Fujie shook his head, his expression turning frosty. "Fellow Daoist Ban Ji, why try to deceive me with such words? When have you ever shown such tolerance toward your enemies?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Besides, this is clearly a stalling tactic by Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Uncertain of your intentions, he sent a subordinate to deliver this reply. He'll likely now focus all his efforts on gathering intelligence about you, hoping to gain a decisive advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Seeing Pi Fujie's darkening expression, Ban Ji's own face immediately turned grim. "Of course I know that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Ever since your last letter mentioned Ning Zhuo, I've been investigating him myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Did you know he participated in Chu Xuangui's Flying Cloud Minor Trial this morning and claimed first place?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Pi Fujie's brow furrowed in confusion. "Chu Xuangui?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He pondered for a moment, recalling Chu Xuangui's intelligence report, and his confusion deepened. "This is a Confucian cultivator, Golden Core-level, and one of the pillars of the Confucian cultivator faction within the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"What's going on? Was this year's Confucian Minor Trial unusually easy? How could an outsider like Ning Zhuo possibly win?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Pi Fujie was genuinely puzzled by this information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ban Ji sneered. "If the trial's difficulty had merely plummeted, that would be the best-case scenario. But I fear... heh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Let me tell you this: Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran also participated in the trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Pi Fujie shook his head. "I'm not familiar with Liu Fushu, but I've heard of Bai Jiyun and Kong Ran for ages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Kong Ran is the son of the current Prime Minister, and Bai Jiyun is on par with cultivators like us, Situ Xing, and Lin Jinglong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"They're genuine Confucian cultivators! How could they possibly lose to Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Pi Fujie grew increasingly bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ban Ji had been observing Pi Fujie's expression closely. Seeing no flaws in his reaction, he raised his chin slightly. "Investigate the details yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"This man is more complex than he appears."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Therefore, I must gather as much intelligence as possible and postpone confronting him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">As Ban Ji spoke, he recalled the words his grandfather had personally imparted to him when he set out from their clan: "My dear great-grandson, I have used the clan's Mechanism to calculate your journey to the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"This journey will be fraught with peril, yet it also holds immense opportunities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Your cultivation of Demonic Arts has severely depleted your Yang Virtue. Now, seeking to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect and advance further has triggered your Human Tribulation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ban Ji felt troubled. "Ancestor, the Myriad Manifestations Sect is a gathering of heroes, filled with countless geniuses and powerful cultivators. How am I supposed to identify which one is my Human Tribulation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">His grandfather stroked his beard and smiled faintly. "I have already marked it for you using the clan's Mechanism."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"When you encounter it, you will naturally feel a spiritual resonance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"However, the moment this Method is activated, your opponent will also sense it. You must exercise extreme caution - even more than usual!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ban Ji nodded solemnly. "Ancestor, I will remember your words."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Since I chose to cultivate Demonic Arts, frequent encounters with calamities are inevitable. I have never regretted my decision!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"In the past, you helped me avoid such calamities in advance. But this time, there is no escape!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"I must join the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Only then can I secure a brighter future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Heh, I'll see what kind of Human Tribulation dares to obstruct my Dao Path!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The moment Ban Ji received Pi Fujie's Flying Message inviting him to deal with Ning Zhuo, a deep tremor stirred within his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Is he my Human Tribulation this time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ban Ji forcibly suppressed the unease in his heart. His regard for Ning Zhuo far exceeded Pi Fujie's expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Therefore, he approached Ning Zhuo with extreme caution, immediately launching a covert and thorough investigation into his background.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">When Ban Ji learned the results of Chu Xuangui's Flying Cloud Minor Trial at noon, his apprehension toward Ning Zhuo deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Pi Fujie urged Ban Ji to act swiftly, but Ban Ji feared that a rash move would prematurely trigger his tribulation, leading to a disastrous defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Thus, he decided to postpone action and conduct a more thorough investigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Remember, I've successfully avoided my previous tribulations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"This calamity is likely far more formidable than any before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Anyone who can become my Human Tribulation must be extraordinary!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"I must proceed with utmost caution!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Fortunately, he's only a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Based on current intelligence, the real challenge in overcoming this tribulation lies in the powerful forces backing him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"If I defeat Ning Zhuo, I risk provoking unforeseen and overwhelming retaliation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
