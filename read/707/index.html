<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">This premonition was baseless, and Ning Zhuo himself found it quite strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Undoubtedly, this heightened his vigilance toward Ban Ji. After some deliberation, he first drafted a polite but firm reply, subtly declining Ban Ji's invitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Then, he summoned Gongsun Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"At your command, Young Master," Gongsun Yan said, cupping his hands in a respectful bow. "What are your orders?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Investigate someone for me," Ning Zhuo instructed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He handed Gongsun Yan Ban Ji's invitation letter, his own reply, and a pouch of Spirit Stones to cover expenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Carrying Ning Zhuo's reply, Gongsun Yan followed the path of the Flying Message until he reached a mountain peak. There, he stood before a cave dwelling, presenting Ning Zhuo's reply as a request to be admitted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The cave dwelling opened, and Gongsun Yan was ushered inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Within the cave, a small banquet was in progress. Music, dance, fine cuisine, and exquisite wines filled the air with a lively atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The hosts of the banquet were Pi Fujie and Ban Ji, the guest of honor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Pi Fujie, his hair as gray as ash and his eyes sunken deep like a skull's, still wore his wide, leather-stitched robe. Yet his expression was no longer arrogant; instead, he wore a forced smile as he whispered to Ban Ji beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Knowing Pi Fujie and Ning Zhuo's history of enmity, Gongsun Yan naturally instructed his subordinates to be vigilant. Sensing Ban Ji's intense hostility, he remained expressionless, showing no fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">When the Flying Message, guided by Qi, flew directly to Ban Ji, Gongsun Yan scrutinized the man closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ban Ji appeared youthful, with a sallow complexion, slightly prominent cheekbones, a hooked nose like an eagle's beak, and thin, tightly pursed lips that conveyed both harshness and greed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Lean and wiry, neither tall nor short, he had unusually long arms and a neck that jutted forward sharply. Seated, he resembled a vulture poised to strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Gongsun Yan bowed respectfully to Pi Fujie and Ban Ji in turn, conveying Ning Zhuo's intentions with neither arrogance nor subservience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ban Ji sat cross-legged, one hand gripping a wine cup and the other resting on his knee. He didn't look up until Gongsun Yan finished speaking, finally shifting his gaze from the cup to the visitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Only then did Gongsun Yan notice Ban Ji's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The whites were unusually prominent, and the pupils were murky amber, like two pieces of aged amber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ban Ji chuckled, his voice tinged with arrogance. "Your attendant is quite capable. How long has he been with Ning Zhuo? Was he assigned to him specifically for this mission to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Gongsun Yan clasped his hands in a respectful bow and explained the truth: he had originally been a guest elder of the Lin Clan, assisting Lin Jinglong in joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect, and had only recently sworn allegiance to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ban Ji's expression remained impassive as he rotated his wine cup between his fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Though inwardly surprised, he maintained a calm demeanor. "Oh? The Lin Clan is quite reputable. How much did Ning Zhuo offer to make you abandon Lin Jinglong?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Gongsun Yan shook his head slightly. "That is not for outsiders to know."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ban Ji chuckled softly. Just moments earlier, his divine sense had scanned Ning Zhuo's reply, confirming his refusal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">With a wave of his arm, Ban Ji declared, "Very well, I've received the message. Since Ning Zhuo is unavailable, we'll wait for a more opportune time to schedule our spar."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Pi Fujie, standing nearby, frowned slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He had deliberately cultivated a relationship with Ban Ji, presenting him with lavish gifts. Though Ban Ji had accepted and sent the spar invitation, he immediately withdrew after Ning Zhuo's refusal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Pi Fujie took a sullen sip of wine, watching Gongsun Yan depart. Just as he was about to speak to Ban Ji, the latter preemptively said, "Fellow Daoist Pi, please remain calm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"As the saying goes, 'One doesn't strike a smiling face.' Ning Zhuo's reply was tactful and courteous, not a complete rejection, merely claiming he was currently occupied."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"With this letter in hand, I can't publicly accuse Ning Zhuo of cowardice or tarnishing his reputation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Pi Fujie shook his head, his expression turning frosty. "Fellow Daoist Ban Ji, why try to deceive me with such words? When have you ever shown such tolerance toward your enemies?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Besides, this is clearly a stalling tactic by Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Uncertain of your intentions, he sent a subordinate to deliver this reply. He'll likely now focus all his efforts on gathering intelligence about you, hoping to gain a decisive advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Seeing Pi Fujie's darkening expression, Ban Ji's own face immediately turned grim. "Of course I know that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Ever since your last letter mentioned Ning Zhuo, I've been investigating him myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Did you know he participated in Chu Xuangui's Flying Cloud Minor Trial this morning and claimed first place?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Pi Fujie's brow furrowed in confusion. "Chu Xuangui?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He pondered for a moment, recalling Chu Xuangui's intelligence report, and his confusion deepened. "This is a Confucian cultivator, Golden Core-level, and one of the pillars of the Confucian cultivator faction within the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"What's going on? Was this year's Confucian Minor Trial unusually easy? How could an outsider like Ning Zhuo possibly win?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Pi Fujie was genuinely puzzled by this information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ban Ji sneered. "If the trial's difficulty had merely plummeted, that would be the best-case scenario. But I fear... heh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Let me tell you this: Bai Jiyun, Liu Fushu, and Kong Ran also participated in the trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Pi Fujie shook his head. "I'm not familiar with Liu Fushu, but I've heard of Bai Jiyun and Kong Ran for ages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Kong Ran is the son of the current Prime Minister, and Bai Jiyun is on par with cultivators like us, Situ Xing, and Lin Jinglong."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"They're genuine Confucian cultivators! How could they possibly lose to Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Pi Fujie grew increasingly bewildered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ban Ji had been observing Pi Fujie's expression closely. Seeing no flaws in his reaction, he raised his chin slightly. "Investigate the details yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"This man is more complex than he appears."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Therefore, I must gather as much intelligence as possible and postpone confronting him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">As Ban Ji spoke, he recalled the words his grandfather had personally imparted to him when he set out from their clan: "My dear great-grandson, I have used the clan's Mechanism to calculate your journey to the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"This journey will be fraught with peril, yet it also holds immense opportunities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Your cultivation of Demonic Arts has severely depleted your Yang Virtue. Now, seeking to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect and advance further has triggered your Human Tribulation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ban Ji felt troubled. "Ancestor, the Myriad Manifestations Sect is a gathering of heroes, filled with countless geniuses and powerful cultivators. How am I supposed to identify which one is my Human Tribulation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">His grandfather stroked his beard and smiled faintly. "I have already marked it for you using the clan's Mechanism."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"When you encounter it, you will naturally feel a spiritual resonance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"However, the moment this Method is activated, your opponent will also sense it. You must exercise extreme caution - even more than usual!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ban Ji nodded solemnly. "Ancestor, I will remember your words."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Since I chose to cultivate Demonic Arts, frequent encounters with calamities are inevitable. I have never regretted my decision!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"In the past, you helped me avoid such calamities in advance. But this time, there is no escape!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"I must join the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Only then can I secure a brighter future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Heh, I'll see what kind of Human Tribulation dares to obstruct my Dao Path!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The moment Ban Ji received Pi Fujie's Flying Message inviting him to deal with Ning Zhuo, a deep tremor stirred within his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Is he my Human Tribulation this time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ban Ji forcibly suppressed the unease in his heart. His regard for Ning Zhuo far exceeded Pi Fujie's expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Therefore, he approached Ning Zhuo with extreme caution, immediately launching a covert and thorough investigation into his background.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">When Ban Ji learned the results of Chu Xuangui's Flying Cloud Minor Trial at noon, his apprehension toward Ning Zhuo deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Pi Fujie urged Ban Ji to act swiftly, but Ban Ji feared that a rash move would prematurely trigger his tribulation, leading to a disastrous defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Thus, he decided to postpone action and conduct a more thorough investigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Remember, I've successfully avoided my previous tribulations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"This calamity is likely far more formidable than any before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Anyone who can become my Human Tribulation must be extraordinary!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"I must proceed with utmost caution!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Fortunately, he's only a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Based on current intelligence, the real challenge in overcoming this tribulation lies in the powerful forces backing him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"If I defeat Ning Zhuo, I risk provoking unforeseen and overwhelming retaliation!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
