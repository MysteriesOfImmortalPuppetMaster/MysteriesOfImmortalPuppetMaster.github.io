<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 564: Ning Zhuo vs Xiang Yue</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Elder Long’s blood burned fiercely, immersing him entirely within a bloody inferno. His wild aura rose sharply, causing even Du Tiechuan’s typically calm eyes to flash with anxiety and shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Elder Long charged towards Du Tiechuan, the momentum fierce and filled with deathly resolve. Du Tiechuan continuously retreated, denying Elder Long any chance to approach. Shuang Ling unleashed almost everything she possessed - every mechanical creation she had was deployed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Whether it was sails, arrows, magical weapons, swords, armaments, or magical artifacts - once touched by Elder Long’s bloody flames, everything melted into nothingness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This self-created technique of Elder Long's possessed immense offensive and defensive prowess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Du Tiechuan discerned the underlying truth, his heart trembling once again: 'He has burned his physical body and nascent soul entirely, converting every bit of his life's essence into this bloody flame, exchanging it for a brief, dazzling splendor!'</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“This man truly is the backbone of Thousand Peaks Forest,” thought Du Tiechuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Even though he was an enemy, Du Tiechuan couldn't help but admire Elder Long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Feeling sorrowful, Elder Long voluntarily ceased his assault. His fierce aura rapidly dissipated, and his mighty physique shriveled back to that of a frail, exhausted old man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He had sounded the strongest note of his life, but it yielded little result - his opponent was equally wise and brave, refusing a direct confrontation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Yet, to force a Soul Formation-level cultivator into retreat was already a remarkable feat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Although Elder Long's energy could have sustained him longer, choosing to stop immediately ushered in the end of his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">At the final moment, Elder Long pointed outward, and the bloody flames wrapped around his shoulder armor transformed into a meteor-like blood flame, shooting towards the sealed Elephant King, Xiang Yue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Du Tiechuan, wary of any sneaky moves from the Dragon King, attempted to intercept the blood-flame meteor but missed narrowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The blood-flame meteor struck Xiang Yue directly, instantly dissolving the mystic military seal which had long restrained him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">A resonant, prolonged elephant cry echoed as Xiang Yue vigorously stretched his arms, finally regaining his freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Elder Long’s spiritual-artifact shoulder guard, now sitting atop Xiang Yue's right shoulder, sobbed. Wiping its tears away it stated, "Master commanded me on his deathbed to serve you and aid you with all my strength. You are now my new master. Please, avenge my former master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Xiang Yue gently caressed the small head of the spiritual artifact child. The spirit child quickly retreated into the shoulder armor, Xiang Yue’s hand naturally following, guiding it to rest upon the armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“I never imagined Elder Long would entrust me with such an important legacy,” Xiang Yue emotionally thought, his rough palm brushing the armor's surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The armor was firm, primitive, yet covered in fine cracks, clearly suffering significant damage despite being a high-tier Void Refining level spiritual artifact, it urgently required repair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In addition to the armor, a cluster of bloody flames penetrated Xiang Yue’s body, quickly condensing and forming extensive tattoos of blood flames across his form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Elder Long’s martial inheritance?” Xiang Yue was deeply moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Elder Long had passed on his martial inheritance to Xiang Yue, embedding its entire essence within the tattoos. Whoever bore these markings could instantly grasp Elder Long's self-created martial techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Xiang Yue raised his gaze to Du Tiechuan in the sky. "Du Tiechuan, how much longer do you intend to retreat?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Du Tiechuan hovered above, staring down at Xiang Yue, pain flashing in his eyes as he noticed the blood tattoos covering Xiang Yue's body. Clearly, he recognized that Elder Long had decisively passed his life's power to Xiang Yue upon death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Among Thousand Peaks Forest's coalition, only Xiang Yue's physical and spiritual foundation could bear such a legacy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">With the blood tattoos and the Void Refining armor, Xiang Yue effectively inherited Elder Long’s strength. Already exceptionally strong, at the peak of the Nascent Soul stage, Xiang Yue now approached the Soul Formation stage, posing a genuine threat to Du Tiechuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">But crucially, the Dragon King had yet to make a move. What exactly were his intentions?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Du Tiechuan furrowed his brow, constantly wary of the Dragon King, unable to fully commit his strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He looked at Xiang Yue and slowly said, "Elder Long is gone, and the Dragon King still hasn't appeared - perhaps he was severely injured in our last encounter. Otherwise, would he stand by and watch your coalition collapse and Elder Long perish?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Since joining the military, Du Tiechuan had always admired talented heroes. He offered Xiang Yue, "If you surrender, I'll grant you high office and abundant rewards. Haven't you always shown sincerity towards your people? Our Two Note Kingdom has abundant treasures in our Kingdom’s treasury to help your tribe flourish and multiply."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The many cultivators from Thousand Peak Forest immediately looked toward Xiang Yue with earnest anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Xiang Yue responded coldly, without hesitation: "High office and abundant rewards? That's nothing more than making me your beast of burden."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Xiang Yue, as a member of the White Elephant Herd, found it easier to assimilate into the Two Note Kingdom. However, in today's cultivation world, humans dominated, and other races were mere vassals. Comparatively, Xiang Yue and his tribe preferred living freely in an isolated land.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">With the failure of persuasion, Du Tiechuan sighed and initiated combat with Xiang Yue. Xiang Yue’s sudden surge in strength couldn't be overlooked by Du Tiechuan. They exchanged blows fiercely, causing the mountains to quake and rocks to scatter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Enhanced by Elder Long’s legacy, Xiang Yue’s strength had significantly improved. His style was straightforward, powerful, and difficult for Du Tiechuan to face head-on. Du Tiechuan wielded a sharp, precise sword, managing to wound Xiang Yue despite his Earth-grade shoulder armor. Xiang Yue accumulated injuries, gradually falling into a disadvantaged position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Meanwhile, Zhu Xuanji, having just learned critical information about Thousand Peak Forest - that the "Old Stone Monster" was captured by the Ginseng Dragon King - realized the elder was merely a planted spy from the Two Note Kingdom. "There must be an important reason for disguising as the 'Stone Elder,' even luring out Ginseng Dragon King himself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhu Xuanji analyzed the situation closely, noting Xiang Yue’s declining position despite repeated attempts to regain the upper hand. Beside him, the Red Sleeve Fairy and Lin Bufan reviewed the critical intel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Lin Bufan sighed, "Elder Long truly calculated well. Even in death, he arranged for Xiang Yue to engage Du Tiechuan, effectively succeeding him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Red Sleeve Fairy remarked, "Xiang Yue’s physical prowess is remarkable - likely surpassing Elder Long. Elder Long’s strength was partially due to the divine tree, giving him an edge. With Elder Long’s death, Xiang Yue is unquestionably the top cultivator in Thousand Peak Forest. Even within the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Two Note Kingdom, he's likely among the strongest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Xuanji observed Xiang Yue thoughtfully, "Indeed, Xiang Yue differs from Elder Long, who placed trust in Ginseng Dragon King, making cooperation with our Southern Bean Kingdom impossible. Xiang Yue must care for his entire tribe - this weakness can be exploited. If he survives this battle, his prestige within Thousand Peak Forest will greatly increase, potentially making him its future leader. Losing him now would be unfortunate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The current situation was undesirable for Zhu Xuanji. The Southern Bean Kingdom needed Thousand Peak Forest’s support, aiming for Two Note Kingdom’s mutual weakening. The Red Sleeve Fairy, secretly placed in Thousand Peak Forest by Southern Bean Kingdom, had considered aiding Xiang Yue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Red Sleeve Fairy suggested, "The Two Note Kingdom camp must have Du Tiechuan guarding against unexpected moves. The Dragon King’s giant mountain lies unattended; I'll secretly move it, creating chaos so Xiang Yue can escape."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Lin Bufan shook his head, "Xiang Yue deliberately doesn't retreat, growing stronger amid adversity. He won't listen to our commands and retreat. Any drastic move might escalate into a broader conflict between Kingdoms."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Lin Bufan furrowed his brows tightly, momentarily uncertain. Who among them had a viable plan?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Suddenly, Zhu Xuanji interjected confidently, "I have a plan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"We can ask Ning Zhuo to take action. Among his group are the Three Generals and the female general Mu Lan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Lin Bufan was stunned. "Du Tiechuan might capture Xiang Yue - who is far more formidable than the Demonheart Cave Master! Even against the Lord Demonheart, Ning Zhuo only played a supporting role. The one who truly injured the Lord Demonheart was Mu Lan, with her divine technique, the Scarlet Heart Homing Arrow!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"But now, Mu Lan has already performed her technique once. I'm afraid she'll find it extremely challenging to use it again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhu Xuanji confidently waved his hand. "Don't worry. I have my own way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He immediately took out a token and infused it with his spiritual energy and a divine message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo felt a sudden vibration, immediately sensing a divine message within his storage belt from Zhu Xuanji. Shocked, Ning Zhuo exclaimed inwardly, "What?! You're sending me to fight against Xiang Yue?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Just as Ning Zhuo was about to shake his head and refuse, he noticed further information in the message, and his expression subtly changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He quickly changed his mind, shouting, "Three Generals, General Mu Lan! How about we score one more big victory?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Three Generals and Mu Lan were already leading their respective troops, rolling through the battlefield with unstoppable momentum, achieving victory after victory in a joyous battle frenzy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Hearing Ning Zhuo's suggestion, they grew curious and immediately asked, "What? We're going to take on Xiang Yue together?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Three Generals were astonished. Ning Zhuo practically patted his chest, confidently assuring them, "Rest easy! I have a brilliant plan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Having experienced numerous trials together, the Three Generals had a deep trust in Ning Zhuo. Even without full details, even if confronting Xiang Yue meant risking their lives, they still agreed readily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Thus, Ning Zhuo led two armies and four elite generals, weaving through the battlefield to finally reach its core region for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Commander Du, step aside! Leave Xiang Yue to us!" Ning Zhuo shouted boldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Both allies and enemies nearby heard Ning Zhuo's shout and felt bewildered. Du Tiechuan cast an assessing glance toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He was still recovering from his injuries, yet was aware of Ning Zhuo's extraordinary accomplishments in the recent chaos. Through Divine Sense observation, he had witnessed Ning Zhuo's exceptional performance firsthand throughout the competition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Very well, I'll leave it to you," Du Tiechuan decisively replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Moreover, Du Tiechuan had long harbored concerns regarding the hidden threat from the Ginseng Dragon King. Ning Zhuo's force was, after all, a foreign army to him; even better, if Mu Lan's Red Flower Battalion suffered losses, the royal capital would greatly benefit from gaining experienced personnel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Thus, Du Tiechuan willingly handed over command.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Xiang Yue felt humiliated and coldly scoffed, "You dare underestimate me so severely? I'll make you pay with your lives!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">But at that very moment, Ning Zhuo sent a secret mental transmission: "Elephant King, do you still remember Qiu Hongfeng from the Glass Pool?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Hearing this, Xiang Yue felt a sudden jolt in his heart, briefly faltering in his step. "What?! You know Qiu Hongfeng’s whereabouts?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo transmitted again, clearly: "I not only know her location, but I also know she carried your child after you parted ways."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"What?!" Xiang Yue's face turned pale in shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Taking advantage of Xiang Yue's distraction, Ning Zhuo attacked fiercely, forcing Xiang Yue to retreat a large step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo quickly transmitted again: "Elephant King, I'm from the Southern Bean Kingdom - not one of the two opposing forces. On the surface, I'm your enemy, but in reality, I'm your friend."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Xiang Yue hesitated, his expression shifting. "Someone from Southern Bean Kingdom?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">As someone of great power, he naturally understood the larger situation. Keeping Thousand Peaks Forest neutral was highly advantageous for Southern Bean Kingdom. An enemy's enemy was naturally a friend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Moreover, Qiu Hongfeng - and the fact she had his child - was a crucial vulnerability Ning Zhuo now firmly grasped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo hurriedly intensified his attacks, secretly transmitting once more: "Elephant King, don’t expose any flaws! Continue fighting fiercely with me. After several exchanges, I'll feign defeat and retreat. You chase me relentlessly, and I'll lead you safely out of this battlefield."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Xiang Yue questioned cautiously, "How do I know you're not tricking me? You could be aligned with the two kingdoms."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"This concerns Qiu Hongfeng - are you willing to gamble, Elephant King?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Filled with heroic resolve, Xiang Yue, in that decisive moment, hardened his heart and replied quietly, "This King - this King will take your gamble! But if you deceive me, I'll never forgive you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Thus, the Three Generals watched as Ning Zhuo’s group fought fiercely with Xiang Yue, their clash appearing exceptionally intense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo’s group soon fell into apparent disadvantage, but Ning Zhuo cleverly seized an opening, "accidentally" striking Xiang Yue squarely in the face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Xiang Yue was humiliated, sinking into a furious pursuit, relentlessly chasing after Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo fled in desperation, leading Xiang Yue, who pursued him relentlessly, through more than half of the ancient battlefield, approaching the fateful location.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Meanwhile, Du Tiechuan rested briefly, casting spells to observe the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">So far, the Ginseng Dragon King had not yet appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The overall situation was already settled!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">With Long Ling's death and Lu Hongtu and others retreating while fighting, the morale of the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance army once again hit rock bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Those caught in the Ning Manor Prison were pursued relentlessly, losing countless lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Only Xiang Yue remained the biggest uncertainty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Hmm?" Du Tiechuan noticed Ning Zhuo and Xiang Yue nearing the crucial site and quickly sent a stern mental message to Ning Zhuo: “Ning Zhuo! I command you to retreat toward me immediately! Otherwise, I'll charge you as a deserter!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Commander, eat this Fire-Boiled Meat Slice - it will rapidly recover your spiritual energy,” said Jia Wan, who was standing nearby, attentively presenting the food prepared by Ding Pi for Du Tiechuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Du Tiechuan had already expended considerable energy in two intense battles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Landing within the government hall, he quickly summoned several Nascent Soul cultivators to protect him. Even if they couldn't defeat the  Ginseng Dragon King upon his appearance, delaying him would be beneficial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Among these cultivators were the master-disciple pair Ding Pi and Jia Wan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Du Tiechuan nodded slightly, vigilantly observing Ning Zhuo's movements while telekinetically picking up the meat slices and beginning to eat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He had barely chewed a few bites when a cultivator suddenly flew in, shouting urgently: “Commander, watch out!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Everyone turned their eyes toward the voice and saw the Big Dipper Sword Master, Lei Qingyang approaching.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ding Pi and Jia Wan's expressions dramatically changed. Ding Pi suddenly turned around and drew his blade, while Jia Wan swiftly threw a metal cover upwards to trap Du Tiechuan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Du Tiechuan truly hadn't expected this master-disciple duo to be traitors!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">As he hurriedly tried to channel his spiritual energy, chaos erupted within his body, forcing him to spit out a mouthful of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">A large metallic cover landed atop Du Tiechuan, and Ding Pi's kitchen knife pierced deeply into his abdomen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This scene utterly stunned everyone present!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">In the next moment, Du Tiechuan roared furiously, exerting all his remaining power to unleash a violent shockwave, knocking away everyone around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ripples formed in the empty air as a pale-faced cultivator, Young Master Shengxu, emerged silently, wielding a golden spike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Without hesitation, the golden spike pierced straight through Du Tiechuan's heart from behind, emerging from his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Young Master Shengxu, having succeeded in his attack, vanished instantly into the void like lightning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">It was too fast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The sudden betrayal and attack had unfolded so rapidly that in mere seconds, the outcome was sealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Clutching his chest, Du Tiechuan struggled desperately to suppress his injuries. Despite employing multiple divine methods, nothing worked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“The wounds are too severe! If I don't return quickly to the capital and harness the Kingdom's power and dragon veins for treatment, my physical body and Soul will both perish!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Thinking of this, Du Tiechuan decisively commanded:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“Sound the retreat! Withdraw immediately! Return to the city!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
