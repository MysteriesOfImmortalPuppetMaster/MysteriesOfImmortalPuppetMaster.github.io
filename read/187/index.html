<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 187: How the Righteous Ning Zhuo Uses Clan Blood and Flesh</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In recent days, Ning Zhuo had been devising a brand-new mechanical body for Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Tree Martial Ape he had previously designed and refined had been completely destroyed in the battle with Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Golden Blood Battle Ape was suitable for use within the Lava Immortal Palace, but not ideal for external use. Mainly, when facing Golden Core Stage cultivators, the material specifications were significantly lacking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Of course, the Lava Immortal Palace provided many opportunities. The Golden Blood Battle Ape would be upgraded in due course.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The second Buddhist Gate and the three checkpoints thereafter had already provided higher-grade materials specifically for upgrading the Golden Blood Battle Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In the previous joint operation of the three factions, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had showcased its might after material replacements and enhancements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"In terms of potential, the Golden Blood Battle Ape clearly has much more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo still hadn't fully understood the design of the Golden Blood Battle Ape, including the materials used for its body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Golden Blood Battle Ape originated from the Golden Furnace, and even the three sects' Nascent Soul Stage experts had only set up eight of them within the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Of course, Ning Zhuo was unaware of the Golden Furnace's existence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After his attempts at analysis, he confirmed that the Golden Blood Battle Ape crafted by the Lava Immortal Palace was indeed extraordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Even if I never fully understand its structure, as long as I continuously replace its materials, I can rapidly enhance the combat power of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng." The Tree Martial Ape Dasheng was strong due to its materials. At the time, due to Zheng Jian, the material grade was far superior to that of the Golden Blood Battle Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">However, in terms of design philosophy, there was nothing unique, and the intricate design was also lacking. Another issue was that the blueprint for the Tree Martial Ape had already been leaked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zheng Jian knew it very well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Of course, this was because the blueprint itself wasn't highly valuable, so Ning Zhuo had shared it to deepen his relationship with Zheng Jian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo wanted to emulate the success of the Tree Martial Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He aimed to refine a mechanical ape with Golden Core Stage combat power to ensure his own safety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Especially in the current situation, with a large influx of unfamiliar cultivators into Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and Ning Zhuo becoming the controller of the black market, he was somewhat in the spotlight, making the need for Golden Core Stage combat power urgent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Cheng Bai was actually at the Golden Core Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">His Golden Core was hidden within the Netherworld Envoy puppet, providing it with power and more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The materials for the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai also needed replacement. Forcing out Golden Core level power would cause the puppet's materials to collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">But since Cheng Bai's spirituality hadn't reached ten percent, even if it did, he would still need to find a way to pass the Spiritual Movement Stage, so he wasn't Ning Zhuo's first choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Xie had the innate talent of Snow Soul Ice Essence and was refined into the Ice Snow Weather Sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Its materials were good and could be upgraded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Although its spirituality was low, Ning Xie was a member of the Ning family, and his relics could be collected to supplement its spirituality, making it very hopeful to achieve ten percent transformation and advance to the Spiritual Movement Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">However, Ning Xie was only at the Foundation Establishment Stage in life, and the mechanical structure of the Ice Snow Weather Sphere differed greatly from his original form. Relying on materials to exert Golden Core level power was possible but limited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After careful consideration, Ning Zhuo determined that Yuan Dasheng was his best choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Yuan Dasheng's spirituality didn't need supplementation and had already passed the Spiritual Movement Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He had Golden Core level combat power in life. His close-combat fighting style could better utilize the material advantages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Most importantly, his righteous bones were as strong as gold, a celestial talent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Yuan Dasheng had mastered the Demonic Blood Vein Technique in life, and at a high level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Even as a mechanical construct, he can still use the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, just like Cheng Bai can still use the Nine Turns Soul Devouring Technique." Using the Demonic Blood Vein Technique required essence blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Therefore, Ning Zhuo planned to refine the Blood Transformation Pool and blood oil bottle as mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">At this point, Ning Zhuo suddenly thought of himself, triggering an inspiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo secretly contacted Sun Lingtong again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo: "The Blood Transformation Pool consumes the bodies of other beings, transforming them into essence blood, which becomes Yuan Dasheng's source of power."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Yuan Dasheng can use the blood and flesh of others to refine essence blood for his use. So why can't he use my blood and flesh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"He mastered the Demonic Blood Vein Technique in life, and using my blood and flesh to refine essence blood means the essence blood is essentially mine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Then, if I have him infuse the essence blood back into me, wouldn't that be a shortcut for cultivation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Sun Lingtong nodded: "Little Zhuo, there's no problem with this idea, but are you sure you want to do this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"You'll have to constantly cut your flesh and bleed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo showed a determined expression: "As long as I can cultivate faster, what is a little pain and suffering?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Brother Sun, do you remember when I was a child, you used iron rods and steel whips to train me to endure pain?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Thanks to your special training, I no longer fear pain!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Now, I'm just cutting my flesh and bleeding, it's like revisiting my childhood training."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sun Lingtong felt a bit nauseous but laughed heartily, patting Ning Zhuo on the shoulder: "Good lad, my efforts in training you back then weren't in vain." Sun Lingtong was very pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">As a member of the demonic faction, he loved adventure and admired the strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo's strong character made him very appreciative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"A real man should be like this, daring to fight, ruthless to others, and even more ruthless to himself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"If you need my help, just say the word."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo said: "Brother Sun, I'll give you the mechanical blueprints. Please help me refine a mechanical ape equipped with the Blood Transformation Pool and blood oil bottle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"I'm pressed for time and under a lot of scrutiny, so it's not convenient for me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"No problem!" Sun Lingtong patted his chest in assurance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Thanks to Ning Zhuo sharing the mechanical tomes left by his mother with Sun Lingtong long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Although Sun Lingtong didn't have much talent in mechanics, his perseverance over the past decade had accumulated enough expertise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">In just two days, Sun Lingtong had refined the mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo secretly took it for his own use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">In the depths of the floating clouds, he extracted Yuan Dasheng's spirituality and infused it into the mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Then, Ning Zhuo took out a sharp dagger, first drawing his own blood, then cutting flesh from his arm, thigh, and abdomen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Waves of pain continuously assaulted his body and mind, but Ning Zhuo remained silent, only furrowing his brows and turning slightly pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Yuan Dasheng did not disappoint, using the ninth level of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to refine the flesh and blood into essence blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo received the essence blood infusion, and his Qi Sea cultivation advanced rapidly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Three days later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo went to the underground base to see Sun Lingtong and share the good news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Sun Lingtong was astonished: "Little Zhuo, I knew your previous Qi Sea cultivation. How did you advance to the peak of the sixth level so quickly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Even though you cut your flesh and bled to supply Yuan Dasheng, you still need time to heal your wounds."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo smiled: "Brother Sun, after cutting myself a few times, I suddenly realized a better method."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I found that just cutting my own flesh and healing myself greatly slowed my cultivation speed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Why not ask my clan members for help?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sun Lingtong: "?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo explained how he operated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Many of the Ning clan members had cultivation, most at the Qi Refining Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">These people found it hard to make a living in the Immortal City, often engaging in low-paying labor like weeding, blacksmithing, fire-starting, and preliminary herb processing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">So, most of the Ning clan members preferred to rely on the family and work in family businesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But the family business had limited scale and positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Most of the Ning clan members, with limited cultivation, could only engage in low-level labor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo knew this situation and ordered his Foundation Establishment cultivators to select some of the poorer clan members to donate essence blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">In return, Ning Zhuo would give each of them a sum of spirit stones after each blood and flesh donation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo said: "I did the math.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Although they get injured, they receive a sum of spirit stones. They can use these spirit stones to buy the cheapest medicine to heal, and still have more than half left."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"They profit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"So, this initiative was widely welcomed. Many clan members who weren't selected volunteered."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">With so much flesh and blood, Yuan Dasheng cultivated the ninth level of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique's blood power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In the process of infusing Ning Zhuo, this blood power would be purified by Ning Zhuo, leaving what suited his physique, and the rest would be returned to Yuan Dasheng as his backup source of power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"With this method, my cultivation problem in the Qi Sea is solved. Hahaha." Ning Zhuo was very pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong was his most trusted person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Whenever he had a breakthrough or progress, he would immediately share it with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">But Sun Lingtong's next words were a bit ungrateful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He frowned, thought for a moment, and suddenly realized: "Your method still uses your clan members, treating them as cultivation materials. Essentially, it's no different from those demonic methods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Cough, cough, cough!" He coughed violently, "Brother Sun, you can't say that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"I'm helping my clan members, giving them work. Their income has increased because of me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"You didn't see their genuine smiles when they received the spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"When I see their smiles, my heart warms."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo emphasized: "I'm helping them solve their livelihood problems and improve their living standards."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"And with their help, my cultivation accelerates, achieving higher results. This is a mutually beneficial and win-win situation, a successful example of righteous cooperation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">After a pause, he added: "I am fundamentally different from those demonic cultivators!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"They are cruel and cold-blooded, harming their own kin for personal gain. Such people are terrifying!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"My clan members are all voluntary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Our cooperation doesn't harm their lives!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Although it injures them, these wounds can be healed with some medicine over time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"After healing, they can cooperate with me more times..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Sun Lingtong clapped his hands: "I get it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Those demonic cultivators slaughter their kin for a one-time gain. But you, my little brother, plan to continuously and steadily obtain flesh and blood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Cough, cough, cough!" Ning Zhuo coughed violently again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Brother Sun, I can't talk to you anymore."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"I am righteous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Righteous!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Sun Lingtong spread his hands: "Alright, say whatever you want."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo sighed, sincerely and earnestly: "Brother Sun, you can't think like this. Although you come from a major demonic sect, you should broaden your horizons and open your mind, not always seeing things so darkly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"You've known me for over a decade. Do you think I'm that kind of person?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Sun Lingtong: ...</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
