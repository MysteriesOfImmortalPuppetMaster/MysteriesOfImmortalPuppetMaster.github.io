<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The first minor opportunity shift, the second minor opportunity shift...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The cultivators gradually figured out the mechanism of the palace trial, gaining much greater understanding of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zhu Xuanji nimbly leaped, navigating through the mechanical traps while pondering, "From the rules of the palace trial, the way to victory is to find the correct path, leave this mechanical maze, step into the main hall, and sit on the throne. But in reality, there are many Secret Pavilion rooms, and once everyone accumulates thirty-six attempts, the order will be reshuffled. The paths previously traversed will completely change, and everything starts anew. Therefore..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"On one hand, I must pass through the challenges at full speed. If others pass three Secret Pavilion rooms while I pass six, it would make my chances of finding the correct path significantly higher than those of others. On the other hand, I need to eliminate as many of the others as possible! The ideal situation is that only I remain, with all thirty-six exploration opportunities in my hands. Hmm?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Thinking of this, Zhu Xuanji's heart stirred and he deduced a conclusion: "This proves that within thirty-six attempts, there must be a path that allows me to break through the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities and enter the main hall!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The cultivators who could enter the third stage of trials were almost all quick-witted individuals. Many, like Zhu Xuanji, realized the true nature of the third stage of trials — it seemed to be about finding the correct path, with a significant element of luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">But in reality, one must eliminate others to gain more exploration opportunities for oneself, thus increasing the chances of escaping the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Inside a Secret Pavilion room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">A battle had just ended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Book Master stood in the center of the battlefield with his hands behind his back. Around him were several mechanical constructs. Some were smashed, some were broken, and others were sealed and unable to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Book Master was an elite of the All-Book Pavilion, well-read and possessing comprehensive and complex methods, ranking among the top among all cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Despite winning the battle, there was no trace of joy on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"The situation is unfavorable for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"In the past ranking lists, I was always in second place. This made others pay too much attention to me, seeing me as a major threat." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In the Book Master's mind, there was always a clear list of the palace trial participants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Including myself, there are thirteen cultivators, but not thirteen factions. There are only four."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"The alliance led by Zhu Xuanji of the Fire Persimmon Immortal City cultivation family is the largest force. The City Lord's Mansion's Meng family and the Void Sect come next."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"The last faction consists of me, Song Fuli, and the Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple. We are quite scattered." When others encounter each other, they may not necessarily fight and might directly join forces due to factional ties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In other words, the Book Master might encounter two or even more enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">More troubling is that everyone's cultivation was suppressed to the Qi Refining Stage. This made it difficult for the Book Master to fight two at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Book Master quickly cleaned the battlefield, dismantling many parts from the mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He did not have methods like the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to directly demonize mechanical puppets like Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"The second Secret Pavilion room I explored was a place specifically for assembling mechanisms, with many suitable mechanical tools. I should return there and use these spoils to assemble a mechanical puppet for protection." The Book Master chose to retrace his steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">He couldn't use storage equipment, but he had temporary storage spells. After casting them, his hands were empty as he pushed open a small door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The next moment, he froze in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Zhu Xuanji!" The Book Master exclaimed in his heart, seeing the cultivator in the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhu Xuanji also immediately noticed him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Both sides were on full alert, and the atmosphere instantly became tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Master Zhu, since the third stage of the palace trial began, you are the first fellow Daoist I've encountered." The Book Master smiled, remaining vigilant of his surroundings while trying his best to ease the atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He was slightly relieved to see no other cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In this room, there were only him and Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">This situation was not the worst.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Zhu Xuanji also smiled at the Book Master, and after a few exchanges, the Book Master quickly took his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Zhu Xuanji hesitated for a moment but ultimately did not make a move, allowing the Book Master to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">In the second stage of the palace trial, the Book Master had shown strong capabilities and a wide range of methods, excelling in versatility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This was characteristic of the All-Book Pavilion, as the vast collection of books made the cultivators there generally well-rounded, with no obvious weaknesses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"What a pity, if only I could meet my own people and advance and retreat together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Encountering the lone Book Master, I should have made a move to eliminate this major threat early!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zhu Xuanji regretted in his heart. Alone, fighting the Book Master would have uncertain outcomes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">If he could exert his full Golden Core power, he might have acted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">But the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities had constrained his power to the Qi Refining level, making Zhu Xuanji very cautious, not willing to start a fight lightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"I still need to quickly meet up with others." Zhu Xuanji stepped forward and continued his exploration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Sun Lingtong frowned, "The Lava Immortal Palace is truly powerful, even suppressing my marriage contract!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Before the third stage of the palace trial, Sun Lingtong had received intelligence from Ning Zhuo, gaining some understanding of the trial content.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He had leaked this to Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The two discussed using their marriage contract to sense each other and quickly meet up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But in practice, Sun Lingtong tasted the bitterness of failure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Sigh, where is the young master? Hopefully, he doesn't encounter others too soon." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">A Golden Core cultivator from the Meng family hurried along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Zheng Shuangjun was also rushing, eager to meet up with Zheng Danlian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Meanwhile, Zheng Danlian, with bloodshot eyes, tore apart the scarlet flame beast blocking his way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">His frustration kept building, and he muttered, "Why, why is my Night Rain Demon Weapon forbidden!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Unable to touch his mechanical scythe, he felt a strong sense of emptiness that constantly tormented him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">As for meeting up, Zheng Danlian had no such thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He only wanted to hold his mechanical scythe and stay close to it at every moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo moved leisurely and calmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"The situation is very favorable for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Behind him, the number of demonized puppets had increased to five.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Additionally, there was a floating box following him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This was another mechanical construct Ning Zhuo had acquired — Little Flying Box.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This storage component contained several mechanical parts Ning Zhuo had accumulated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo didn't master any storage spells but the appearance of the Little Flying Box solved his need for storage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The situation was indeed very favorable for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Or rather, it was the most favorable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Because others had limited options for meeting up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo could encounter Zhu Xuanji, Ning Jiufan, Yang Chanyu, or Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">If he expanded the range slightly, Zheng Shuangjun, Zheng Danlian, and Zhou Nongying were also possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">There were only thirteen cultivators in the third stage of the palace trial and he had up to seven potential allies among them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"In fact, I have already met the Book Master once, thanks to Fei Si's introduction letter. I have also traded with Song Fuli. It's just the Golden Core true disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion who I'm not familiar with."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Looking around, Ning Zhuo had decent relations with other cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">In the second stage of the palace trial, Ning Zhuo had demonstrated his strength, ensuring that when everyone was suppressed to the Qi Refining level, he wouldn't be seen as an easy target!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"However, I still can't fully trust the Golden Core ancestors of the Zheng and Zhou families." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo hadn't forgotten his previous deductions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Even though alliances were under contract, such things could be countered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The possibility of forming alliances and breaking them always existed, and Ning Zhuo never forgot the possibility of these two families secretly cooperating with the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The mechanism sounded again, and the Secret Pavilion slightly trembled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">All cultivators were very serious and cautious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Because this time, it was already the third round of changes. According to the information, this was no longer the third minor opportunity shift but the first major opportunity shift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Everyone understood the minor opportunity shifts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">What was the major opportunity shift?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Meng Chong pushed the door open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The next moment, he saw Zhou Nongying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Zhou Nongying's pupils shrank, and he nodded expressionlessly, "It's you, Meng Chong. Go ahead, we have an agreement between our two sides. I won't trouble you for now. No one has been eliminated from the list yet, so eliminating outsiders like the Book Master and the Void Sect is the right strategy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"If you encounter your Meng family's Golden Core cultivator, please take care of him as well, okay?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Meng Chong clenched his fists, with tiny electric sparks flickering above his head, "No!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He decisively refused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Meng Chong stared at Zhou Nongying, his face full of excited battle intent, "We are both at the Qi Refining level, Senior Zhou. This opportunity is too rare, and I really want to spar with you." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Zhou Nongying's face darkened, "Junior, you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Meng Chong's eyes brightened, "If I remember correctly, Senior Zhou seems to lack innate talent, right?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Innate Talent—Wild Sprint Thunderclap!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The next moment, Meng Chong moved like lightning, fiercely attacking Zhou Nongying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He was bold and full of spirit, daringly initiating the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Since the third stage of the palace trial began, this was the first battle between cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Before this, even if cultivators encountered each other, their interactions would have been similar to the exchange between Zhu Xuanji and the Book Master -- restraining themselves and being very cautious, not rashly making a move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">With the support of Wild Sprint Thunderclap, the distance between Meng Chong and Zhou Nongying shortened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Zhou Nongying was shocked and puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Zhou Nongying, with his hands behind his back, sneered, "Let me tell you, after the second opportunity shift, I stayed in this Secret Pavilion without leaving. I set up a formation here in advance to guard against the risks of the major opportunity shift. Meng Chong, I spared you, but you didn't appreciate it. You deserve to be eliminated." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The next moment, Zhou Nongying pointed a finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The formation roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Meng Chong was bound like an insect in amber, unable to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The next moment, the overwhelming power of the formation descended! If this were to land, Meng Chong would surely be eliminated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">But the next moment, Meng Chong used his mana to infuse a token in his arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The token flew out, blocking the formation's power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">A word was spelled out from the large characters on the token — Immunity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">A mechanism component immunity token!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">With the activation of the immunity token, Meng Chong's figure slowly dissipated from the original place — he was teleported away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Zhou Nongying snorted coldly, displeased, "There's such a mechanism? How come I haven't encountered it?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Meng Chong's body reappeared out of thin air in the Secret Pavilion room he was in before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Damn it, I used my only immunity token. Zhou Nongying!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Unlike what other cultivators' would have done given the circumstances, Meng Chong, filled with anger, chose the same door again, stepping in to face Zhou Nongying once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Zhou Nongying: "You're back?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He was also angry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">He was being underestimated like this, "I want to see how many more immunity tokens you have!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Meng Chong grinned, "None, just the used one. But I have other things!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Saying this, he gagged and retched, spitting out a large number of mechanical tools from his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Zhou Nongying's expression tensed. The number of mechanical tools Meng Chong took out was too many.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"So the major opportunity shift greatly increases our chances of encountering each other." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The Book Master understood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">He smiled, looking at Song Fuli in front of him, "Brother Song, meeting you is my good fortune." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Song Fuli nodded repeatedly, "Yes, our faction is the weakest. We shouldn't fight; we should join forces instead." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">By and large, the cultivators in the palace trial weren't foolish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">What the Book Master thought of, Song Fuli also thought of.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">These two outsiders didn't fight and immediately chose to unite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">But instead, Meng Chong and Zhou Nongying from Fire Persimmon Immortal City engaged in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Meanwhile, at the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain, amidst the clouds and mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">A burly man with a tiger's back and a bear's waist strode forward, approaching Meng Kui, "Cousin, long time no see, hahaha." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Meng Kui smiled, "Meng Hu, it's good that you're here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">One of the four great families of the Meng family, Nascent Soul level, Meng Hu, quietly arrived!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">A cup of tea later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Electric light filled the entire Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Zhou Nongying looked down in disbelief at the huge wound on his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Then, he slowly raised his head, looking at Meng Chong, who was drenched in blood and grinning foolishly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"I... actually lost?!" Zhou Nongying murmured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Hahaha!" Meng Chong put his hands on his waist, ignoring the blood gushing from his wounds, laughing heartily, extremely delighted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The information quickly spread, shaking everyone's hearts—"Meng Chong fought Zhou Nongying, the latter eliminated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
