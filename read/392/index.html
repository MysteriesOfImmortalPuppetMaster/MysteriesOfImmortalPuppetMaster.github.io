<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji held Ning Zhuoâ€™s letter, feeling as if it were burning hot in his hands!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Although he wanted to throw it away, he recalled that when he returned to the capital for duty and met with the emperor, he was directly ordered to represent the Southern Bean royal family in handling the Lava Immortal Palaceâ€™s matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">But Zhu Xuanji felt that he was just being pushed to the frontline by the emperor to interact with the Destined One!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Gritting his teeth, Zhu Xuanji opened the letter with difficulty and scanned its contents with his divine senseâ€”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Respected Elder Brother Zhu Xuanji:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">(Zhu Xuanji: Who's your elder brother? Don't call me that randomly!)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Since our parting, we've been separated by vast distances with scarce news. Days and months have passed swiftly, and it's already been dozens of days. A day apart feels like three autumns, and your demeanor and voice have never left my thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">(Zhu Xuanji: Why do you remember me so clearly? Just forget about me!)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Recalling our time at Lava Immortal Wealth, where we shared the same boat and fought side by side. On Cloud Concealment Mountain, we weathered storms together and formed alliances - truly one of life's great pleasures. Your strategic thinking was profound, your actions unrestrained. I sincerely admired you, and whenever I think of those times, I can't help but reminisce about those scenes, still feeling warmth in my heart. If we could continue our previous connection, it would truly be heaven-sent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">(Zhu Xuanji: Who said we fought side by side? Weren't you just manipulating me? This isn't good, not good at all! What does this kid want my help with now?)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">I have a small request. I've long heard of our Southern Bean Kingdom's Spring Longing Wine, known for its fragrant aroma and indescribable excellence. It's truly a worldly treasure. Though I've never tasted it, I've longed for it for a while. I dare ask brother to gift me a jar, to quench my thirst for fine wine and add to our continued friendship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">(Zhu Xuanji: Spring Longing Wine? This kid has developed a taste for wine? Fine, I'll give it to you, just don't trouble me anymore.)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Additionally, there was a great ancient figure named the Five Elements Divine Lord. I'm very interested in this figure, but have limited information at hand. Thus I specially request brother to give me some intelligence about this, to resolve my confusion. If I could learn even a bit, I would be immensely grateful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">(Zhu Xuanji: Five Elements Divine Lord? That's an impressive name, it seems like I've seen it somewhere. Seeking information from me? You're after the Inspection Bureau's archives and records, aren't you? Clever kid, you've asked the right person. I'll give it to you, every bit of it!)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">I also wish that in your recent investigations, your thoughts move like lightning, penetrating through all mysteries. May all difficult matters become clear as day, with everything going smoothly, achieving early success. If brother has free time, I wish to invite you to the Myriad Medicine Sect for a gathering, where the scenery is beautiful and the vegetation lush. We could drink fine wine together, reminisce about old times, and discuss new strategies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Please take care. I hope everything goes smoothly for brother, and hope for an early reunion to fulfill our grand ambitions!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Respectfully,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">Ning Zhuo</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">(Zhu Xuanji: The Myriad Medicine Sect? Oh, there's a large sect there called Myriad Medicine Sect. Wanting me to go to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley? Haha, how could that be possible? Dream on!)</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">After reading the letter, Zhu Xuanji's forehead was slightly sweating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">He wanted to stay as far away as possible from the Destined one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">Going to the Myriad Medicine Sect?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">No way!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">I absolutely won't go!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">Take the Spring Longing Wine and information about the Five Elements Divine Lord. Take it all!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Please don't bother me.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">"Wait, why is Ning Zhuo specifically seeking information about the Five Elements Divine Lord? What has he encountered?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">"Don't think about it, don't think about anything."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">"Why get involved with the Destined One's matters?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Zhu Xuanji immediately warned himself internally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">He remained fully vigilant as he personally searched through the archives, looking through records, extracting information about the Five Elements Divine Lord, and creating jade slips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">He also used his connections to obtain century-old Spring Longing Wine from the royal treasury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">Finally, he used the postal station's special transmission privileges to send these items to Ning Zhuo at maximum speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Ten Thousand Medicines Valley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">Ning Zhuo received the intelligence and was quite pleased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">He sighed to Sun Lingtong: "Old Zhu is a reliable and capable person. I didn't expect him to handle these matters so quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">"For him, it's a small matter, but it's helped me greatly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">"Indeed, we must thank him properly in the future. We'll seek his help again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">Sun Lingtong replied: "Your Ning family's performance in the Lava Immortal Palace Wealth matter is critical to whether Fire Persimmon Immortal City falls into the Meng family's hands. This is very important to the royal family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">"Little Zhuo, you're now a crucial figure in the Ning family, so of course Zhu Xuanji would take you seriously."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">"However, I never expected that in the end, we would become friends with Zhu Xuanji. The twists and turns of worldly fate are truly unexpected."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">"But, regarding your investigation into the Five Elements Divine Lord, do you still have doubts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Ning Zhuo nodded and hummed in agreement: "I've thoroughly read historical books and classics, yet never heard of the title Five Elements Divine Lord. With such great abilities, he must be an ancient figure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">"The living have yang longevity, the dead have yin longevity. Yang longevity is limited, and yin longevity is likewise. According to normal logic, ancient powerful beings should have exhausted their ten thousand years of yin longevity by now. But I feel that the Five Elements Divine Lord is still alive and kicking. This isn't normal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">"The biggest point of suspension is that after I returned to the Mechanical Dragon, even though I was sober, I still received the Five Elements Divine Lord's transmission of teachings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">"I told this to Linghu Jiu, but even he couldn't explain it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">"There are many strange aspects to this. My receiving the teachings and obtaining the complete 'Five Organs Temple Divine Art' seemed too easy. Moreover, my Five Elements realm advancement is even more valuable than this divine technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">"I'm still young, but I've read many books. Though my experience is limited, the Lava Immortal Palace was something I planned about for fourteen years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">"To be honest, suddenly receiving such great benefits makes me feel uneasy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">Sun Lingtong shrugged: "What's there to be afraid of? You're not cultivating this divine technique anyway, and your advancement in the Five Elements completely belongs to you - it's a genuine benefit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">"Yin longevity may be limited, but how can we use normal logic to measure a great being like the Five Elements Divine Lord?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">"We're just two Foundation Establishment juniors, how could we possibly understand the Five Elements Divine Lord's power?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Ning Zhuo shook his head: "I'd feel more at ease referring to the 'Five Organs Temple Divine Art' in the future if I first conduct a proper investigation and understand the details."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Sun Lingtong nodded: "Yes, such caution is not bad. Let's look together at what the jade slip says."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong both projected their divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">They learned all the intelligence about the Five Elements Divine Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">As Ning Zhuo had previously guessed, the Five Elements Divine Lord was indeed an ancient figureâ€”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">He appeared after the Blood Remnant Dynasty, at the beginning of the Martial Emperor era!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">The Blood Remnant Dynasty was the first dynasty in history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">A dynasty meant unifying the entire world, controlling all territories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Throughout world history, there were only three dynasties. The Blood Remnant Dynasty was the first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">At that time, human cultivators weren't the main characters; demons and monsters roaming freely was the dynasty's most notable characteristic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">After the dynasty's collapse, various forces across the world fell into fighting and slaughter, complete chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Until a man of mixed human, demon, and monster blood ascended to the imperial throne, only then did the world become a place of order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">This man was the Martial Emperor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">In history, he was considered the second emperor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">In the history of the world there were only five empires acknowledged by everyone. The first criterion for being considered an empire was that the empire must occupy at least 80% of the world's territory and have enormous influence as the world's main power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">The Five Elements Divine Lord had a very close relationship with the Martial Emperor, being both friend and foe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">He was extraordinarily talented with a strong personality. Before the Martial Emperor ascended to the throne, they fought enemies side by side, developing a deep bond as battle companions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">The Five Elements Divine Lord's rise to fame came from his battle with the Black River Dragon Demon. At that time, he single-handedly invaded the Black River, fighting until the river ran red, ultimately battling the Dragon Demon for three days and three nights before slaying it. With one person's strength, he swept away an entire demon power, shocking the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">His peak battle was against the Blood Sea Demon Lord. He led an army, besieging the Blood Sea for years, finally using the Five Elements Demon Slaying Formation he laid a trap for the Blood Sea Demon Lord and killed him. After this battle, he was recognized as second only to the Martial Emperor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">The Five Elements Divine Lord's final battle was the Ten Thousand Demons Mountain Campaign. The Martial Emperor led his army, sweeping across the world, causing demons and monsters to gather at Ten Thousand Demons Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">With demon forces gathered together, the Martial Emperor couldn't break through. The Five Elements Divine Lord was entrusted with the crisis, personally charging into battle. He manifested five spirits, divine light piercing the heavens, engaging in a life-and-death battle with the demons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Finally, the Martial Emperor's army conquered Ten Thousand Demons Mountain, completely dismantling what was once the highest peak, and the Five Elements Divine Lord died in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">This is the official history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">However, according to many clues collected by the Investigation Bureau, archaeological information was gathered and compiled into an unofficial history.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">The unofficial history told of a love triangle between two men and one woman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">The two men were the Martial Emperor and Five Elements Divine Lord, and the woman was the Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">The two men had traveled the world together in their early years when they met her, both developing romantic feelings. However, ultimately, the Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort married the Martial Emperor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">However, the Martial Emperor had many consorts and was focused on his great enterprise, neglecting the Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort's feelings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">The Five Elements Divine Lord and Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort met frequently in private, eventually being discovered by the Martial Emperor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">The Martial Emperor then schemed to have the Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort captured by demons and taken to Ten Thousand Demons Mountain. The Five Elements Divine Lord recklessly went to rescue her, and ultimately both died together on Ten Thousand Demons Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">This was also why after achieving his great enterprise, the Martial Emperor personally ordered the removal of all records, attempting to bury the matter of the Five Elements Divine Lord and Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort in the river of history, unknown to future generations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">After reading this, Sun Lingtong said: "So the Martial Emperor was this kind of man. Hmph!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">Ning Zhuo pondered: "No wonder I hadn't heard of this person's title. On one hand, he was from ancient times, on the other hand, many records were deliberately erased, so very little was passed down."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">The information didn't explain why the Five Elements Divine Lord lived until now, teaching Ning Zhuo in the netherworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">"Ten Thousand Demons Mountain, Ten Thousand Demons Cave, Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, Myriad Medicine Sect... I never imagined this valley was once the world's highest peak. What was once a holy mountain where ten thousand demons gathered is now just the residence of an ordinary medicine-selling sect. There's no better example of the changes of time," Sun Lingtong sighed endlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">Ning Zhuo frowned deeply: "Something's not right, I feel something's strange."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">"Big Brother Sun, I need to drink the Meditative Brew again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Sun Lingtong said: "You can drink, but stay away from the Spirit Concealing Willow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">"Of course I know that," Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">He directly left the Mechanical Dragon and had Sun Lingtong drive it to shrink into a corner of the cave dwelling, staying far away from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a cushion and solemnly took a sip of the Meditative Brew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Nothing happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">He took several more sips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">All remained calm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Ning Zhuo frowned deeply, and after pondering for a while, called for Hua Guzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">"Master Ning! You finally summoned me!" Hua Guzi's eyes shone with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Ning Zhuo waved his hand: "Look at this wine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">Hua Guzi used various methods to test it, finally tasting a sip, and spat: "This wine is poorly made, the recipe is contradictory, it's nothing but fake wine!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"Young Master, quickly tell me, who dared to fool you with this thing? I'll cut them down to avenge you!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
