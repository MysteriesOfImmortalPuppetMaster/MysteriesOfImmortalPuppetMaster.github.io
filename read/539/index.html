<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
In an instant, the heavens darkened and the earth became gloomy.<br/>
<br/>
A tremendous sound shook the heavens and the earth, making the cultivators’ eardrums ache and even causing them to bleed on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Endless ice fog and smoky dust intertwined, completely engulfing the battlefield in just a few heartbeats!<br/>
<br/>
When the smoke dissipated, more than half of the Nascent Soul cultivators of Two Note Nation had perished.<br/>
<br/>
Not only had their physical bodies perished, even the Nascent Souls were completely annihilated under the power of mystic arts!<br/>
<br/>
The three remaining Nascent Soul cultivators were all heavily injured, their faces marked by terror and fury, tottering precariously, barely clinging to life.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion was affected by the aftershock, with eighty percent of the entire army falling; most of the remaining soldiers were also lying on the ground, either spitting blood or unconscious.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning were in no better state, their bodies drenched in blood and their eyes darkened.<br/>
<br/>
Even Sun Lingtong, who was concealed within the mechanical dragon, was also injured, half-kneeling on the ground, staring at the marks of intertwined ashes and frost on his body, his voice trembling: “T–terrible offensive!”<br/>
<br/>
“The Twin ghosts’ Heaven and Earth combined strike contained the profound mysteries of the cosmic way, sealing off the space in an instant.”<br/>
<br/>
“No, more precisely, it disrupted the space, causing any Nascent Soul that attempted to escape into the void to be courting its own death!”<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, we were able to hold on until now, aside from the unexpected effect of your Buddha Heart Demon Seal, entirely because these two did not truly unleash their full power.”<br/>
<br/>
“Flee! Based on our talent and abilities, we will surely be able to reclaim our ground in the future; there is no need to show off when we are weak.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, his face resolute: “The Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth commit sins that are boundless; if they are not eradicated even for a day, they harm the common people for a day.”<br/>
<br/>
“We must preserve our useful bodies, strengthen ourselves, and in the future eliminate these two great villains to bring welfare to the world.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, before we leave, we must first use the mechanical dragon to rescue all the remaining soldiers of the Three Generals Battalion.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong:?!<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, are you serious?”<br/>
<br/>
The battle was so critical that at this crucial moment, to rescue people was completely to squander the already slim chance of escape -it was an act of extreme irresponsibility to oneself.<br/>
<br/>
“Wait, it’s the buddhist thoughtss!” Sun Lingtong instantly realized.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s divine sea was filled with buddhist thoughts, which resulted in his mind being extremely kind and benevolent, possessing an immense spirit of self-sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
“Although the Buddha Heart Demon Seal was profound and mighty, Ning Zhuo had never truly mastered this magical treasure.<br/>
<br/>
“Previously, I was lucky; relying on the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, I managed to hinder the Earth Ghost who bore the Tian Shuang Ghost Face, but now the buddhist thoughts were similarly interfering with Ning Zhuo’s ability to make correct decisions.”<br/>
<br/>
“I must first use thievery techniques to completely steal away the buddhist thoughts from his divine sea, in order to resolve this drawback.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong thought of a plan and felt exceedingly anxious.<br/>
<br/>
According to his plan, it would take quite a bit of time to completely steal away the buddhist thoughts from Ning Zhuo’s divine sea.<br/>
<br/>
And at that moment, time was precisely what they lacked the most.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong could only hope that the Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth would temporarily concentrate their attention on the remaining Nascent Soul cultivators of Two Note Nation, and not on them.<br/>
<br/>
Bang bang bang……<br/>
<br/>
Tian Shuang ascended into the sky, while Earth Ghost descended to the ground, and both great ghost cultivators were panting.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, performing this Heaven-Earth combined strike was also a heavy burden for both of them.<br/>
<br/>
However, even if they collapsed from exhaustion, it would not invite any contempt.<br/>
<br/>
The surviving Nascent Soul cultivators looked at these two great ghost cultivators, their eyes filled with terror.<br/>
<br/>
“Flee!” Even the once imposing Liev Yang Zhenren, at that moment had no will to fight, and activated his innate magical treasure, releasing the Golden Crow phantom.<br/>
<br/>
He mounted the Golden Crow phantom, soared into the high sky, and swiftly left the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
This action immediately caused the remaining Nascent Soul cultivators’ morale to completely collapse!<br/>
<br/>
“Flee!” The remaining two Nascent Souls also each employed their own means, desperately fleeing for their lives from two other directions.<br/>
<br/>
“They can’t see us, they can’t see us. Hurry and chase after them! It would be such a pity if they were spared,” Sun Lingtong prayed desperately.<br/>
<br/>
However, reality was extremely cruel.<br/>
<br/>
The Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth merely glanced at the fleeing Nascent Soul cultivators before both fixed their gaze on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s heart plunged to the bottom of a valley in an instant!<br/>
<br/>
The strength of the Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth lay not only in their techniques but also in their combat acumen and unwavering clarity of purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this scene, Lin Bufan could not help but have a slight change in expression: “As expected of the Nascent Soul True Sovereign renowned throughout the nations!”<br/>
<br/>
The Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth, one above and one below, slowly advanced toward Ning Zhuo and the Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
The Red-sleeve Fairy became nervous and looked at Zhu Xuanji, waiting for him to give the order, at which point she would deploy the Mountain Moving Divine Technique to disrupt the battlefield and create an opportunity for Zhu Xuanji to rescue people.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji took a deep breath, slowly clenching his fist, but soon he relaxed his grip a little.<br/>
<br/>
All because he saw a figure who, without hesitation, stood in front of Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
“Young Master, you go quickly! I will fight to the death to buy you some time.”<br/>
<br/>
The one protecting Ning Zhuo was none other than the incarnation condensed from the Tian Shuang Ghost Face.<br/>
<br/>
The Earth Ghost’s true form, upon seeing this scene, laughed heartily and mocked the Heaven Ghost: “Tian Shuang, so you are so benevolent, sacrificing yourself for others!”<br/>
<br/>
Tian Shuang’s true form’s face instantly darkened, and he said coldly: “How can you dare laugh? The way you have used my Ghost Face like this is completely your fault!”<br/>
<br/>
While speaking, Tian Shuang also took action.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly waved his hand, and a fierce chill surged forth.<br/>
<br/>
The chill coalesced in mid-air, forming a massive ice blade that viciously slashed toward Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
“Ha!” At the critical moment, Zhang Hei stepped forward, wielding a Black Snake Spear, summoning a surging mighty force-as if an ant resisting a dinner knife-and truly repelled the assault of the ice blade.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei’s own cultivation techniques and innate talent had made him adept at prolonged battles; the longer the fight, the stronger he became.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, his personal combat power had already reached its peak!<br/>
<br/>
The enormous ice blade still pressed forward; in order to hold it back, Zhang Hei’s muscles tensed all over, his veins bulged, and blood spurted from his orifices.<br/>
<br/>
Although his personal combat power had reached its peak, his military strength had suffered too many losses.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion had suffered heavy damage, losing eighty percent of its soldiers. And the soldiers who fell in battle were not mechanized puppets that could be replenished immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Although Zhang Hei was strong, he was ultimately only at the Golden Core stage. Without the leverage of a large army, relying solely on talent, cultivation techniques, and weapon performance, one could not leap to the Nascent Soul level.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that he was faltering and about to be severely injured, Guan Hong hurriedly delivered another Blood Dragon Blade strike.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei’s burden was greatly alleviated.<br/>
<br/>
But even combining the strength of the two, they still found it difficult to repel the advancing ice blade.<br/>
<br/>
Witnessing this, Liu Er sighed deeply and also dual-wielded the Xuanhuang Swords to join the fight.<br/>
<br/>
Bang.<br/>
<br/>
A dull thud was heard.<br/>
<br/>
The combined strength of the three generals eventually shattered Tian Shuang’s massive ice blade.<br/>
<br/>
Tian Shuang sneered coldly with a “heh heh”, while the Earth Ghost remained expressionless, though his eyes revealed a fierce gleam; upon seeing Ning Zhuo and the Three Generals Battalion, he regarded them like lambs waiting to be slaughtered.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, Zhang, Ning, and the others all wore faces filled with solemnity.<br/>
<br/>
The battle situation was so clear.<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul cultivators of Two Note Nation had all fled the battlefield; their military strength suffered heavy losses and they were unable to form any battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
Without the support of an army, Liu, Guan, and Zhang were immediately reverted to their true forms -only at the Golden Core stage-and they risked their lives to fend off even a single spell.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, on the other hand, could mobilize the Mechanism Army, and he was constantly maintaining the Martial Formation: Warriors’ Revival Technique on himself. But what use was it?<br/>
<br/>
The inventory of mechanism puppets had already dropped to around one hundred.<br/>
<br/>
Such consumables, in the face of the Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth, were as fragile as paper. Could they last for two rounds?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo expressed deep doubts about this.<br/>
<br/>
Tian Shuang Ghost Face let out a long sigh: “True form, do not commit further murderous sins; one mistake leads to another.”<br/>
<br/>
“You turn back!”<br/>
<br/>
“That is why, by putting down the butcher’s knife, one can immediately become a Buddha...”<br/>
<br/>
“Shut up!” Tian Shuang’s true form’s face looked extremely grim; without allowing Tian Shuang Ghost Face to continue at length, he directly acted, interrupting his words.<br/>
<br/>
Tian Shuang Ghost Face struggled to resist; with half of his body shattered, he nonetheless managed to block the Nascent Soul-level spell.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said, “Little Zhuo, let’s get out of here quickly; don’t be overly compassionate!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head and stepped forward: “The Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth have come because of me, you all leave!”<br/>
<br/>
He then secretly transmitted to Sun Lingtong, “Boss, do not expose yourself arbitrarily. I have a premonition that if I were to escape by diving into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, according to the methods of the Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth, they would certainly target me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Let me try to create an opportunity for you.”<br/>
<br/>
“You do your best to seize the chance-take some soldiers, take Liu, Guan, and Zhang, and run!”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t worry, I am not that worried.”<br/>
<br/>
“I have already noticed that the Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth have been rather restrained in their offensive against me. If they truly intended to take my life, I would not have been able to hold on until now.”<br/>
<br/>
“They must be intending to capture me alive.”<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, you go first; I won’t die just yet.”<br/>
<br/>
“As long as we keep the green mountains, we need not worry about firewood; you run off first, and then look for an opportunity to rescue me.” Ning Zhuo spoke in a deliberately casual tone.<br/>
<br/>
This was actually the very words that Sun Lingtong had always used to look after Ning Zhuo in the past.<br/>
<br/>
In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he was often arrested and imprisoned due to failed thefts, and Ning Zhuo would frequently bail him out.<br/>
<br/>
In this situation, the roles of the two had reversed.<br/>
<br/>
But when it came to Sun Lingtong’s turn, he did not hesitate to refuse, shouting, “No way! The Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth are demonic ghost cultivators, Little Zhuo; if you fall into their hands, you will surely be bullied and live a life worse than death.”<br/>
<br/>
“I would never allow that to happen!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo tried to persuade him further.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong roared, “Shut up, you stinky brat, you must listen to me. I am your boss!”<br/>
<br/>
While the two brothers were secretly arguing, Zhang Hei suddenly burst into loud laughter.<br/>
<br/>
“It seems that my old Zhang’s life is about to be lost here.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hahaha!”<br/>
<br/>
“Dying here would not be so bad either.”<br/>
<br/>
“Big brother, second brother, military strategist -even if we die, we must fight to the end!”<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei, full of heroic spirit, after saying these words, charged directly toward the Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, hey, hey, hey!” Liu Er was caught off guard; he stretched out both arms, his five fingers splayed, trying to grab Zhang Hei, but he was too late, and could only watch with wide eyes as Zhang Hei charged to confront the formidable enemy.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, who supervised the Three Generals Battalion, knew that Ning Zhuo possessed a hidden magical treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Although he did not know exactly what this treasure was, based on Ning Zhuo’s past performances, he could roughly guess a thing or two.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Liu Er did not give up on hope and had high expectations for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
But before he could even communicate with Zhang Hei, the reckless man charged toward the formidable enemy.<br/>
<br/>
The Twin ghosts of Heaven and Earth snorted coldly in unison.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, Tian Shuang’s mood was very poor: “Since you wish to die, I will oblige you!”<br/>
<br/>
