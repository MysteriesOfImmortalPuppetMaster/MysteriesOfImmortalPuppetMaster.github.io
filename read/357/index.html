<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">On the day of the duel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">In the large training arena, Ning Zhuo and Han Zhou stood facing each other.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The crowd was large.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Most of the cultivators were quite familiar with Han Zhou, but for many, it was their first time seeing Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">"Is he Ning Zhuo from the Fire Persimmon Immortal City?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"He looks quite ordinary to me. How did he win the favor of the eldest lady?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">"Whether he's ordinary or not, we‚Äôll soon see in this fight."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">Many scrutinizing eyes were fixed on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">Among them was Lin Shanshan, who had come in disguise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">Since she had promised Ning Zhuo she would watch the fight, she intended to keep her word. However, over the past few days, she'd heard some annoying rumors, so she decided to disguise herself a bit to avoid attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">Blending into the crowd, Lin Shanshan was not noticeable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Little did she know, a gaze quietly descended, observing the entire training arena and pinpointing her exact location in the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">That gaze belonged to Lin Bufan, the leader of the Myriad Medicine Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">Despite his many responsibilities and busy schedule, Lin Bufan had been informed of this trivial matter by someone close to him, who took it upon themselves to please their master during his brief rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">"Shanshan has never taken this much interest in a male cultivator before. Who exactly is this Ning Zhuo? Investigate him for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">After giving the order, Lin Bufan remembered the date of Ning Zhuo and Han Zhou's duel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">Now, having specifically paused his duties, he activated a spell formation. Though far away in Yuanlai Mountain, he could clearly observe the fight on Little Contention Peak, seeing everything in detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">‚ÄúHe has a good appearance...‚Äù Lin Bufan thought as he observed Ning Zhuo for the first time and nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">He himself had a handsome and refined appearance, and Ning Zhuo's demeanor gave him the impression that Ning Zhuo came from a prestigious cultivation family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">Lin Bufan‚Äôs first impression of Ning Zhuo was quite favorable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo, meanwhile, was sizing up Han Zhou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Han Zhou was thin and pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">His face was weathered, showing the marks of hardship and fatigue. However, his eyes were calm, reflecting a strong will and an acceptance of suffering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">His hair was sparse and disheveled, a mix of gray and white, as if it were the remnants of melting snow. It was loosely tied at the back with a simple hemp string, in a messy fashion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He wore a shabby gray robe, full of patches and tears. His feet were clad in worn-out straw sandals that made a scraping sound as he walked, with the soles so worn down that his frostbitten toes poked through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">His skin was rough, marked by frostbite and scars, and his fingers were coated with a layer of white frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Generally speaking, even cultivators of humble means would keep themselves somewhat tidy, at least ensuring their clothes were intact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">But Han Zhou wasn't like that. It was as if he wanted everyone to know he came from a beggar's background.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands and saluted: "Brother Han Zhou, I‚Äôve been looking forward to this duel for a long time. Today, I hope to experience the strength of your bitter cold techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Han Zhou's voice was hoarse: "Fellow Daoist Ning, our paths have brought us to this duel. Let us both do our best."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Han Zhou was direct. As soon as he finished speaking, he rushed toward Ning Zhuo, his fists clenched, cold air radiating outward and forming frost flowers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">White frost quickly spread, covering the surface of his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Frost Fist!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo's face became solemn. At the moment Han Zhou launched his attack, Ning Zhuo simultaneously retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">As he withdrew, he cast a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">In an instant, green vines burst from the ground, writhing like snakes, coiling toward Han Zhou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Han Zhou suddenly accelerated, attempting to bypass the vines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo expanded his divine sense, continuously controlling the vines, making them grow and wrap around Han Zhou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Seeing that he couldn't evade, Han Zhou simply stood his ground, letting out a low shout as his fists pounded the vines, freezing them instantly. Cold air spread outward, rapidly encroaching on the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo, having gathered intelligence beforehand, already knew that the cold energy Han Zhou emitted contained something unique: the bitter cold energy cultivated from the Bitter Cold Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This energy was difficult to defend against. It could easily infiltrate a cultivator‚Äôs body, gradually corroding both their physical body and spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">At first, the effects of this corrosion were subtle, but over time, as the cold energy accumulated, its impact became increasingly severe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Many of Han Zhou‚Äôs past opponents had fallen to this very bitter cold energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo activated his five-element power, circulating it to refine it into fire energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">With a gesture of his hand, a pillar of fire shot out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">At first, the pillar was thin, but midway through, it expanded like a giant serpent. By the time it reached Han Zhou, the fire column had grown so large that it resembled the support columns of a palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Han Zhou stood motionless, not even attempting to dodge as the flames engulfed him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">For a moment, the fire burned fiercely, but the bitter cold energy seeped into the flames, weakening them almost immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Despite Ning Zhuo's efforts to reinforce the fire, he couldn't make the flames grow any stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">After just a few breaths, the flames on Han Zhou‚Äôs body had almost entirely died down, leaving only a few flickering embers clinging to his hair and clothes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">‚ÄúGood fire technique,‚Äù Han Zhou calmly remarked before continuing his charge toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and then cast a spell of the earth element.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">In an instant, yellow sand swirled, covering the entire arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The sand attaching itself to Han Zhou gradually accumulated until it completely encased him, forming a clay sculpture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Earth Technique ‚Äì Clay Sculpture!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But soon, large patches of white frost began seeping out from within the sculpture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The frost solidified the sand into blocks, breaking apart the structure, which crumbled and fell away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Han Zhou walked out of the clay sculpture, his expression calm, his gaze firm, and his body exuding an aura of unrelenting hardship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo's face remained expressionless as he used the metal element technique next.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">His palm struck like a blade, sending out a series of golden blades that slashed toward Han Zhou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Han Zhou continued walking forward, not dodging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">The golden blades finally managed to tear his already tattered clothes and leave some wounds on his body, causing a little blood to seep out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">‚ÄúMultiple elements!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Han Zhou‚Äôs face grew even more weathered, but his aura surged to its peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Though he had only been defending, his presence felt overwhelmingly powerful, like an unstoppable force. Ning Zhuo felt the immense pressure building, as if a giant boulder weighed down on his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The spectators whispered among themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">‚ÄúHan Zhou has already gone all out from the start!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">‚ÄúEven though I'm just watching, I can feel the respect Han Zhou has for Ning Zhuo! It's because of this respect that he‚Äôs fighting with all his strength, using his Suffering Body technique.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">‚ÄúNing Zhuo‚Äôs mastery of spells is impressive, but even his gold element attack, known for its offensive power, has only caused superficial wounds. He‚Äôs in danger now!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Lin Shanshan, hidden in the crowd, heard the comments and silently agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">She grew more anxious, knowing that Han Zhou‚Äôs next assault would be even more violent and fierce.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This was because the Suffering Body technique was similar to the Diamond Body technique, but while the latter increased defensive power, the former allowed its user to grow stronger with each hit they took.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">As long as Han Zhou could still fight, the more damage he sustained, the stronger he became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Ning Zhuo's metal element spells aren't enough to break the Suffering Body in one strike. What will he do now?" Lin Shanshan felt anxious and uneasy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">She desperately wanted Ning Zhuo to win.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Not only because she had deep feelings for Ning Zhuo, but also because she had put in a great deal of effort to help him train.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The more effort she invested, the more she saw things from Ning Zhuo‚Äôs perspective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Han Zhou stomped the ground, causing the tiles of the arena to crack beneath his feet. His speed surged, and he shot toward Ning Zhuo like a cannonball.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The distance between them rapidly closed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Ning Zhuo, racing against time, pushed both palms forward, unleashing a water element technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Three waves of water surged into the air, crashing toward Han Zhou with tremendous force, attempting to push him back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">The first wave slowed Han Zhou‚Äôs charge significantly, but by the second wave, his power had increased enough to hold his ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">By the third wave, he charged straight through!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">Using his body as a blade, Han Zhou sliced through the water, finally reaching Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, his eyes sharp. After days of special training, he was ready to test the results of his efforts in this real battle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">The two clashed in close combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">At first, they were evenly matched, but soon, Han Zhou seized control of the rhythm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">His fists and feet alternated in relentless attacks, like a fierce storm.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
