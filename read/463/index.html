<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 463: Mu Lan vs Zhang Hei</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Mu Lan’s face was as calm as still water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zhang Hei roared at the gate of the Red Flower Battalion’s camp, his voice booming like thunder, causing a very large negative impact on the army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">However, Mu Lan still suppressed her anger: “General Zhang, be quiet for now. I still do not know what happened. Let me inquire first!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Mu Lan questioned the soldiers involved in the brawl. The soldiers responded truthfully, feeling aggrieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Zhang Hei forced down his anger, waving his hand repeatedly: “Ask, go ahead and ask!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“They insulted Old General Mu, saying our Red Flower Battalion specializes in shirking responsibility onto our comrades, acting worse than animals!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“It was the people of the Third General Battalion who provoked us first!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“We did not make the first move. It was the people of the Third General Battalion who spat and slept right on our faces.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Mu Lan nodded and responded to Zhang Hei right on the spot: “General Zhang, the course of events is now clear. Since it was your side that initiated the provocation, why not summon the parties involved so we may confront them face-to-face.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhang Hei was furious. Holding his Black Serpent Spear, he once again pointed its tip at Mu Lan: “My soldier is already lying in bed, Life Hanging by a Thread, currently receiving treatment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Do you truly want him to come confront you? Or have you seen through this and are using words to force me?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“I came to seek justice, and it seems the only way to achieve it is through fists!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Mu Lan’s face remained as calm as still water. Anger pushed her to a mocking smile: “You black scoundrel, just promoted and already so full of yourself? Since you keep using insolent words and truly seek a beating, let me fulfill your wish!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhang Hei laughed loudly, mobilizing his magic power, and was the first to soar into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Mu Lan also immediately took to the air and drew out a long spear from her storage ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The Blood-Tasseled Spear!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Its total length was about seven feet, with an excellent grip and a design perfectly balanced. It was suitable for swift assassinations and could also unleash extremely fierce sweeping strikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The shaft was made of wax-white wood, as tough as iron, with a smooth surface and a faint yellowish hue that exuded an ancient, rustic aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The spearhead was sharp and slightly curved, gleaming with a cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The most striking feature was none other than the red tassel at the top of the spear. The red strands at the end of the tassel were as bright as fresh blood, swaying in the wind like a flowing river of blood. The crimson tassel formed a sharp contrast with the pure white spear shaft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Zhang Hei, on the other hand, held his Black Serpent Spear and charged straight upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Clang! Clang! Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Spear and lance clashed, bursting forth dazzling sparks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The violent collisions were piercingly loud, echoing throughout the military camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The commotion caused by Zhang Hei was quite large. The entire Red Flower Battalion was alarmed. Almost all the officers and soldiers looked up to the sky to watch the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“That Zhang Hei is too arrogant!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“The reason their Third General Battalion could capture Ma Fei-Tui alive was all thanks to our Red Flower Battalion weakening him beforehand!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhang Hei and Mu Lan fought in close combat, crossing blows up and down in midair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“What’s there for them to be so proud of!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“General Mu, please teach that black scoundrel a good lesson!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The soldiers of the Red Flower Battalion were full of confidence in General Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Zhang Hei’s Black Serpent Spear was heavy and overbearing. His moves were rough and straightforward; each strike brought a howling gust of wind and impressive momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Mu Lan’s Blood-Tasseled Spear was as swift as a crimson lightning bolt, focused mainly on thrusting. The technique she cultivated was the Profound Gold Armor-Piercing Art, renowned for its ability to penetrate armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Mu Lan’s spear techniques were swift and fierce. Each thrust of the spearhead left behind stunning arcs of blood-colored radiance in the eyes of the observers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Her movements were plain and unadorned, far less flamboyant or wild than Zhang Hei’s. Yet every motion was extremely precise, forcing Zhang Hei to dodge and evade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Mu Lan spun around, her cape whipping through the air and creating a swirl of light and shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“Whoosh!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The light and shadow veiled Zhang Hei’s eyes, blinding him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Taking advantage of the moment, Mu Lan thrust out the Blood-Tasseled Spear. The spearhead pierced through the chilly air, aiming at Zhang Hei’s right arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">At this critical juncture, Zhang Hei relied on hearing the wind to determine position. He retreated explosively while using the Black Serpent Spear horizontally as a block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">A dull thud sounded as the Black Serpent Spear was shaken off course.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhang Hei’s figure wavered, revealing even more openings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Mu Lan seized the opportunity and attacked again swiftly. The spearhead stabbed forth like lightning, this time aiming directly at Zhang Hei’s neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhang Hei backed up once more. The muscles in his right arm bulged as he forcibly retracted the Black Serpent Spear, barely managing to use its tip to block Mu Lan’s spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">He caught his breath, then gripped the Serpent Spear with his left hand as well, exerting force with both arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Hah!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He forcefully shoved, pushing aside Mu Lan’s Blood-Tasseled Spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Mu Lan’s figure was as agile as the wind, her posture light. She sidestepped to the left, and once again, with blinding speed, slanted her Blood-Tasseled Spear toward Zhang Hei’s abdomen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhang Hei let out a muffled grunt. This time he truly failed to defend in time, and his abdomen was drilled through with a bloody hole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He clenched his teeth and endured it, bringing the spearhead down from above to smash viciously toward Mu Lan’s head, a stance ready to trade life for life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Mu Lan wore no helmet and refused to risk her life recklessly, so she was forced to withdraw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Zhang Hei barely stabilized his footing, showing not the slightest fear. The fighting spirit in his heart surged even stronger due to his rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A sharp glint flashed in Mu Lan’s eyes, and a trace of admiration rose in her heart: “He is indeed a valiant general.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Come again!” He brandished the Serpent Spear and took the initiative to charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">She kept thrusting her Blood-Tasseled Spear, occasionally sweeping it horizontally, forming a rain of spear strikes that enveloped Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhang Hei, like a trapped wild beast, continued to roar and fight desperately. However, the wounds on his body increased in number, and blood began to flow profusely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Mu Lan held a clear advantage in her duel against Zhang Hei!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yet as the battle continued, Zhang Hei’s power grew rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">His eyes were filled with anger. Wielding the Black Serpent Spear, he created a series of black shadows, astonishingly swift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Black shadows surged like waves, raging and tumultuous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Black Overwhelming Waves Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zhang Hei’s technique gradually took effect. With simple attacks, he could produce a vast expanse of black waves, inflicting damage over a certain area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Meanwhile, his entire body seemed to fill with vigor. His sinews bulged like coiled flood dragons around his torso, granting him even greater strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He possessed a natural talent —Mad Python Sinews!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This innate ability allowed a cultivator’s sinews and membranes to swell and condense into python-like cables whenever the cultivator fell into anger, granting terrifying strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The more furious the cultivator became, the stronger their underlying potential, and the more astonishing the power bestowed by the Mad Python Sinews.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Yet another clash of the Blood-Tasseled Spear and the Black Serpent Spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">But this time, the Blood-Tasseled Spear was knocked aside, and the Black Serpent Spear continued forward!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">A fierce gleam flickered in Mu Lan’s eyes. Realizing the danger, she began attacking with all her might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Zhang Hei’s arms were swollen like mountains. The python-like sinews coiled around his entire body, unleashing a force as overwhelming as a sudden flood bursting forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Black Overwhelming Waves Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Mad Python Sinews!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Black Serpent Spear!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">These three combined so that each of his attacks stirred up surging black waves. Within these black waves, the Serpent Spear was like a flood dragon rampaging through the sea, incomparably ferocious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">And as Zhang Hei fought, his strength grew greater and greater, rendering the Black Serpent Spear even heavier and more overbearing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The shaft swept across like rolling giant waves, powerful enough to destroy any enemy blocking its way!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Mu Lan, nimble as the wind, gradually felt like a red bird overlooking a black sea, facing a sense of helplessness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“This can’t go on! That black scoundrel…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Mu Lan would never admit defeat, especially not in front of her own troops.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">She snorted coldly, pulled away, and flew rapidly to widen the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Zhang Hei was momentarily stunned, recalling Mu Lan’s archery skills, and immediately pursued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">But his speed could not compare to Mu Lan’s, who easily stayed far out of his reach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Mu Lan drew out her treasured weapon, the Vermilion Phoenix Bow, and fitted a Fiery Heart Arrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">She then activated her divine ability, the Crimson Heart Hawk Arrow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Zhang Hei’s scalp went numb, sensing that he was firmly locked onto, unable to escape no matter where he fled—be it heaven or earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“So this is how that Temple Priest at Dragon King’s Shrine felt back then.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“So terrifying!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“I’m going to die!” Zhang Hei’s eyes widened desperately. Even facing death, he refused to look away!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The next moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Poof.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
