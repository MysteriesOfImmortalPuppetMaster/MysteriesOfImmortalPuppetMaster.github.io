<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo stepped out of the Medical Pavilion. <br/>
<br/>
On his way, three Golden Core cultivators descended from the sky: Zhu Xuanji, Ning Jiufan, and Zhou Nongying. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had anticipated the arrival of the Golden Core cultivators and quickly bowed in respect. <br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying asked, "Little one, what just happened in the Medical Pavilion?" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan continued, "I lost my sense of you for a while. Tell us about your encounter in the Medical Pavilion." Zhu Xuanji remained silent, merely observing Ning Zhuo. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out a sound of surprise, then earnestly explained to the three Golden Core cultivators that he had just accepted a high-reward task in the Medical Pavilion and entered the critical treatment room. <br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps that room is special, isolating the inside from the outside," Ning Zhuo suggested. <br/>
<br/>
The three Golden Core cultivators exchanged quick glances.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's response matched their previous speculations and discussions. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo showed a worried expression and added, "Did entering the critical treatment room weaken your perception of me? Could you perhaps enhance it a bit more?" Ning Zhuo proactively requested the Golden Core cultivators to increase their surveillance on him. <br/>
<br/>
This behavior caused Zhu Xuanji's eyes to flicker slightly. <br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo's fearful demeanor, the Ning family patriarch, Ning Jiufan, snorted, "Look at you, so spineless." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly lamented, "Patriarch, I am merely at the Qi Refining Stage. If I had your strength, I would roam freely with great vigor." "I am of the Ning family bloodline; you must provide me with more protective measures." "How could I not be aware of the current situation?" <br/>
<br/>
"The one controlling the Five Elements Tower and attacking Fire Persimmon Mountain is truly vicious and malicious!" "What's more frightening is that we still haven't identified who they are." <br/>
<br/>
"We, the reformation team members, due to our status as trial disciples, have convenient access to various positions." "By earning merits on such a large scale, we are surely a thorn in the side of the true culprit, who will undoubtedly target us." "It's only because of the protection from the Golden Core patriarchs that they haven't had the opportunity yet." <br/>
<br/>
"My solo trip to the Medical Pavilion, entering the treatment room alone, was like knowingly walking into a tiger's den." "How can this be considered cowardice? It's clearly the courage to face death without fear." <br/>
<br/>
These words left the three Golden Core cultivators momentarily speechless. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan snorted again, "Oh, you smooth-talking brat." "Why don't you mention that the Medical Pavilion, a critical place, can only be accessed by trial disciples?" "Even if the true culprit has Golden Core cultivation, they can't approach the Medical Pavilion." "You're quite safe in there." <br/>
<br/>
"Precisely because of this, we didn't rush to act when we lost our sense of you." <br/>
<br/>
"How is this facing death without fear?" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo adopted a serious expression and carefully said, "Patriarchs, this is how I see it." "Currently, we've discovered that only trial disciples can take on positions in the Medical Pavilion." "But is that truly the answer? No one can be certain." "It's just that all evidence points to this answer for now." <br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps it's possible that even outsiders can join the Medical Pavilion through some channel or method." <br/>
<br/>
"I think the Lava Immortal Palace, after all, is a palace left by the Three Sects' elders. The elders were compassionate and wouldn't only benefit their own people without leaving a path for others." "Perhaps the true culprit has a way or secret path to infiltrate the Medical Pavilion and harm me." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo deliberately said this to cover up the flaw in his actions. <br/>
<br/>
As the Five Elements Tower's leader, he had fully activated the tower to attack Fire Persimmon Mountain. <br/>
<br/>
This action was a flaw. <br/>
<br/>
Because so far, no one had been able to join the Five Elements Tower. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, no one had been able to join the Command Platform and take on related positions. <br/>
<br/>
Currently, Zhu Xuanji and the others hadn't confirmed the fact that "only trial disciples can work in the Five Elements Tower." <br/>
<br/>
Once they confirmed this, they would likely narrow down the true culprit's identity to the trial disciples! <br/>
<br/>
This would be extremely disadvantageous for Ning Zhuo! <br/>
<br/>
So before that happened, Ning Zhuo needed to use his speculation to mislead Zhu Xuanji and the others, diverting any potential suspicion. <br/>
<br/>
This was preparing for a rainy day. <br/>
<br/>
The three Golden Core cultivators listened to his analysis and, for a moment, had no rebuttal. <br/>
<br/>
Before confirming with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, they indeed couldn't be certain. <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, Zhu Xuanji had entered the Immortal Palace many times, attempting to contact the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, but had never succeeded. <br/>
<br/>
In such a situation, Ning Zhuo insisting that he risked his life and faced death without fear was plausible. <br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying suddenly chuckled and said to Ning Jiufan, "Brother Ning, your Ning family has indeed produced a talent, truly enviable." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan quickly replied modestly, "Not at all, compared to your family's Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu, this kid Ning Zhuo still has a long way to go." "He has some insight into the situation, but don't be fooled by his arguments and apparent courage; he's actually greedy and just wants rewards." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up, and he immediately showed a flattering smile, "Hehe, Patriarch, I'm not just doing this for myself." "I'm contributing to the family." <br/>
<br/>
"Look, I'm in such a dangerous situation now. Shouldn't you grant me some more protective measures?" "Would you bear to see a family descendant fall victim to that heinous criminal?" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan pointed at Ning Zhuo, laughing and scolding, "Look at this, everyone, this is a good descendant of the Ning family. I was right about him." <br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying and Zhu Xuanji also laughed upon hearing this, and the atmosphere lightened. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan continued, "Last time, I gave you many talismans for protection, and I haven't taken them back." "This time, what else do you want?" <br/>
<br/>
"You are indeed contributing to the family, but the family will reward you accordingly later; you won't miss out!" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly spoke, "I actually want to separate from the family. Patriarch, can I separate?" <br/>
<br/>
"As for the rewards, I don't really count on them! If the main branch rewards me, it would be good enough if they don't pin a crime on me." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's face immediately showed anger, "Insolent!" <br/>
<br/>
He was about to say something harsh when Zhou Nongying suddenly laughed heartily, interrupting him. <br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying turned worry into joy. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier, he had seen Ning Zhuo's excellence and felt uneasy. <br/>
<br/>
Although the Ning family's strength was not as great as the Zhou family, Ning Zhuo, this descendant, had recently been in the limelight, indeed quite outstanding, surpassing Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen. <br/>
<br/>
This made Zhou Nongying feel a slight threat, and he was not comfortable with it. <br/>
<br/>
But now, seeing Ning Zhuo openly revealing the Ning family's shortcomings and the conflict between the branches and the main line, Zhou Nongying couldn't help but look forward to the scene of Ning Zhuo clashing with the main line in the future. <br/>
<br/>
After laughing a few times, Zhou Nongying took out an artifact from his storage pouch and tossed it to Ning Zhuo. <br/>
<br/>
It was a handkerchief. <br/>
<br/>
The handkerchief was covered with countless chaotic, seemingly patternless formation lines. <br/>
<br/>
But in fact, it only appeared to be without pattern. <br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying introduced, "This is the Four Directions Inversion Formation Disk. In times of crisis, just throw it out, and it might buy you crucial time." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo received it with great joy and quickly expressed his gratitude. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's eyes flashed with a sharp light, knowing Zhou Nongying was giving him a hard time, but outwardly, he had to express thanks to Zhou Nongying. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji smiled, descended to the ground, and walked a few steps to Ning Zhuo's side. <br/>
<br/>
"You indeed are a meritorious minister." <br/>
<br/>
"Recently, the reformation team members have made great progress, thanks to your generous sharing of experience." "Let me check on you." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo inwardly snorted, fully aware of Zhu Xuanji's suspicion.<br/>
<br/>
But outwardly, he showed a very happy expression and cooperated with Zhu Xuanji. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji placed his hand on Ning Zhuo's back, activated a spell, and his eyes glowed with a faint golden light. <br/>
<br/>
After a thorough check, Zhu Xuanji confirmed that his surveillance methods hadn't been altered. <br/>
<br/>
Only then did he relax. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo eagerly looked at Zhu Xuanji, "Lord Zhu, investigating the truth and finding any clues about the true culprit is our duty, and we will spare no effort, regardless of life and death." "For now, it seems that my risky probe into the Medical Pavilion shows no sign of the true culprit." <br/>
<br/>
After a pause, Ning Zhuo shifted his tone, "But I believe the Medical Pavilion is only temporarily safe." <br/>
<br/>
"With the rampant demonic beasts, the villain can earn merits by slaughtering them in large numbers, much more conveniently and quickly than before." "If he truly has found some shortcut or loophole to join the Medical Pavilion, we will be in trouble!" <br/>
<br/>
"However, whenever I think about how important the Lava Immortal Palace is, and that I have the opportunity to contribute to the family and shine for the Southern Bean Kingdom, I am filled with motivation, and my blood seems to boil..." <br/>
<br/>
"Alright, alright." Zhu Xuanji waved his hand, showing a helpless expression, interrupting Ning Zhuo. <br/>
<br/>
"I know what you want to say and understand your intentions." <br/>
<br/>
"This is for you, as a reward for your recent good performance." With that, he tossed an item. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly caught it and, upon closer inspection, found it was a crystal stone. <br/>
<br/>
The stone was completely transparent, quite heavy, as if made of pure glass, without a trace of impurity. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was surprised and exclaimed, "This is a top-grade crystal stone!" <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji explained, "This stone originally contained ice attribute natural spiritual power, but I've used it up." "However, it still holds great value!" <br/>
<br/>
"Because any top-grade crystal stone will automatically absorb spiritual energy from the surroundings to replenish itself." "However, an ice attribute top-grade spirit stone can only be filled with ice attribute spiritual power." <br/>
<br/>
"You like creating mechanical constructs, right? This top-grade crystal stone is a natural mana pool, very suitable for you." "However, if you want to fill it with ice attribute mana in a place like Fire Persimmon Mountain or Lava Immortal Palace, you'll need to put in some extra effort." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo expressed his gratitude repeatedly, holding the top-grade crystal stone in one hand and the formation disk handkerchief in the other, looking eagerly at Ning Jiufan. <br/>
<br/>
He didn't speak, but his eyes said it all. <br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying and Zhu Xuanji also looked at Ning Jiufan. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan coughed, maintaining a neutral expression, and said, "If you're worried about the rewards, let me tell you. This time, I will personally oversee the rewards. Are you satisfied?" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly expressed satisfaction and was about to speak further. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan had already turned and flew away. <br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and Zhou Nongying each chuckled and also flew off. <br/>
<br/>
Once the three Golden Core cultivators were out of Ning Zhuo's sight, he let out a barely noticeable sigh of relief. <br/>
<br/>
He had anticipated such a scenario. <br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's reminder was indeed reasonable. <br/>
<br/>
If he had used the three drops of Supreme Virtuous Water in the critical treatment room earlier, the three Golden Core cultivators might have re-implanted surveillance methods on him. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stored the formation disk handkerchief and the top-grade crystal stone in his storage belt. <br/>
<br/>
It seemed that each time, he managed to shear some wool from the Golden Core patriarchs. <br/>
<br/>
The reason for this, Ning Zhuo understood well. <br/>
<br/>
"The potential and abilities I've shown make the Golden Core patriarchs believe that I will surely have a place in the future Fire Persimmon Immortal City." "Whether they are investing in me or trying to suppress the Ning family and incite internal strife, they tend to win me over while I'm still insignificant." "After all, the cost of winning me over at this stage is minimal. Once I reach the Foundation Establishment Stage, it will be different." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo returned to his residence. <br/>
<br/>
Unexpectedly, he found a jade slip by his bedside. <br/>
<br/>
After checking it, he found that the jade slip was from Ning Jiufan. <br/>
<br/>
In the jade slip, Ning Jiufan specifically left a message for Ning Zhuo, telling him: this "Talisman Annotation" is his insights from studying the Ning family's talisman scenery, and Ning Zhuo should read it secretly.<br/>
<br/>
He should not speak of things he shouldn't. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo understood Ning Jiufan's intentions. <br/>
<br/>
On one hand, he had just maintained face in front of Zhu Xuanji and Zhou Nongying without directly rewarding Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
This jade slip served as compensation. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, he was also worried that Ning Zhuo might use this jade slip to boast and elevate his prestige within the Ning family. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's concern was not unfounded. <br/>
<br/>
If not for Ning Jiufan's specific message, Ning Zhuo might have indeed planned to do so. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo put away the jade slip. <br/>
<br/>
It was a good item, but he currently had no time or energy to study it.</div>
