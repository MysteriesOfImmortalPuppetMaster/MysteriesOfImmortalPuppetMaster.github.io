<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu stood beside Chen Sui’s corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The cause of death had been identified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">It was the Black Iron Piercing Needle now clenched tightly in Wen Ruanyu’s hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He gripped it so hard that the veins on the back of his hand bulged. The usual grace he exuded had vanished, replaced by seething fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Outrageous! This is too much!” he spat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Even under layers of surveillance, a male consort had still been killed. It was as if someone had slapped Wen Ruanyu squarely in the face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">A humiliating blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">What made it even more infuriating was that the trail of clues pointed straight to Sun Tiesheng - so conveniently that Wen Ruanyu couldn’t bring himself to investigate. The whole thing reeked of a trap laid by the true killer, meant to divert attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo gazed down at the corpse and spoke slowly. “More than the clues, what concerns me is this - how was the body discovered so quickly?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Wen Ruanyu’s eyes flashed as he immediately caught the implication. “You mean... even the discovery itself was orchestrated by the traitor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“I think that’s highly likely,” Ning Zhuo said. “If Chen Sui had been quietly assassinated, our setup would have ensured that all the male consorts remained locked in competition, pouring their energy into the Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation day and night until a sole victor emerged.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“In other words, they’re barely allowed to leave their rooms.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“But now the body was found almost instantly, and panic spread through the entire Vigorous Yang Manor like wildfire.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“This sudden blow to morale... benefits Forgetful River Prefecture Lord the most.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Wen Ruanyu nodded. “That makes sense. I’ll look into it right away.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He moved swiftly, and soon returned with his findings, his face clouded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“It was a paper puppet,” he said grimly. “One of those summoned to handle chores. It was following Chen Sui’s prior instructions to clean his room in the morning. When it arrived, the door was wide open. Inside - it found the body.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo frowned. “If it was just a paper puppet, why shout about it so loudly? Why alert everyone?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Wen Ruanyu replied, “Jiao Ma, clearly you don’t understand how these paper puppets work.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“White Paper Immortal City was built by the Mystic Ink Scholar, a Void Refining cultivator. We, as his successors, still don’t fully grasp his purpose in constructing the city.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“But we’ve learned much about its functions and powers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“For example, these puppets are incredibly practical. They carry out daily tasks and even wartime labor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“They possess spiritual awareness, indistinguishable from ordinary people. This comes from the city itself. Over countless ghost tides, both ghostly beings and living cultivators have died within White Paper City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“The city gathers the lingering energies of the dead. Over time, this accumulation undergoes a transformation - what we call the origin of spirit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Puppets infused with this origin gain sentience, becoming almost human.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Because their intelligence and base materials vary, so do the types of puppets. The ones assigned to mundane chores are usually formed from commoners’ spirits. Naturally, they’re more prone to panic and outbursts. It's normal for them to lose composure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“I see now,” Ning Zhuo said with sudden clarity. “I thought it might have been a move by the City Lord herself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Wen Ruanyu shook his head. “Her puppets are different. They’re granted authority by the city itself.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Perhaps you’ll gain the same benefit - after all, you are our Vice City Lord now.” This last comment was sent via divine sense, whispered privately to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">A gleam flickered in Ning Zhuo’s eyes and vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Rather than verify that guess, his mind turned to something else - the seven armies of paper soldiers stationed in the Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“If these puppets only awaken through infusion of spirit...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Then what if I extracted Yuan Dasheng’s and Meng Yehu’s spirit essence, and instilled it into unclaimed paper puppets? What would happen?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong discussed the possibility; however, they found no good solutions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Whoever the traitor was, their methods were terrifying. Despite the tight surveillance on Chen Sui, they had still managed to strike and leave no trace behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">And the only lead they had was an obvious trap - or perhaps, a cruel taunt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“For now, only you, Senior Wen, can keep the other consorts calm and maintain the Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation,” Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Wen Ruanyu suppressed his growing headache. “There’s nothing else we can do. As long as the array remains active, the traitor will be forced to act again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“But to be frank... I’m hesitating.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“This course of action means treating the male consorts as bait. Using them to lure out the spy. Is it really worth the sacrifice?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“It is,” Ning Zhuo said firmly. “Without question.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“Let’s be honest - Shen Bing and Chen Sui were only Foundation Establishment cultivators. How much yang energy could they really contribute?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“If using them as bait lets us lure the traitor into revealing a flaw, allowing us to take them out in one stroke, then their contribution would far outweigh anything they offer as consorts!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Wen Ruanyu gave a bitter smile. “Easier said than done. What if we never find the traitor? Then what?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">As he spoke, he turned a worried gaze on Ning Zhuo. “Jiao Ma, you need to watch your back too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Your Jiao clan’s cultivation arts are well known.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“If Sun Tiesheng dies, you might become the next target.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo nodded, his expression turning grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">That same night, rumors swept through the Vigorous Yang Manor like wildfire, further eroding what little peace remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">They all said more or less the same thing: Shen Bing and Chen Sui had both been assassinated - then the third night would surely claim Sun Tiesheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">After all, those three were the strongest male consorts in the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">They were the undisputed leaders among the rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Wen Ruanyu had spent the better part of the day calming the ranks and restoring morale - only for these rumors to undo all his efforts in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Furious and alarmed, he launched an immediate investigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The results left him somewhere between exasperated and amused: the source of the rumors was none other than Sun Tiesheng himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Wen Ruanyu stormed over to confront him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Tiesheng dropped to his knees and burst into tears, sobbing to Wen Ruanyu that he was consumed by fear and anxiety. But not for himself - no, what terrified him was the thought that if he died, who would help the City Lord refine the yin energy? Without his contribution, the fall of White Paper Immortal City would be inevitable. And if the city fell, so too would the Sun clan. In that case, he would be the traitor who doomed his own family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Wen Ruanyu snorted coldly. “You’re overestimating your importance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Get up. I won’t hold you accountable - for now. But one day, I’ll settle accounts with you and your entire Sun clan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">With a flick of his sleeve, Wen Ruanyu turned to leave. But before departing, he issued orders to assign additional guards to protect Sun Tiesheng, layering on even tighter security.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sun Tiesheng spotted the influx of cultivators and smirked to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">His scheme had worked. By raising the alarm, he had forced Wen Ruanyu to take him more seriously - and more importantly, to deploy more personnel for his protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Even someone as esteemed as Wen Ruanyu, a Golden Core cultivator, had no choice but to go along. He saw through Sun Tiesheng’s ploy but had to accept it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Because what he hated more than petty scheming was the traitor still hiding in the shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“This time, I’ve tripled the number of guards watching over Sun Tiesheng. Let’s see you try to assassinate him now,” Wen Ruanyu muttered through clenched teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">That very night - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Beyond the walls of White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">A squad of ghostman cultivators suddenly burst out from underground, surrounding a team of yin soldier scouts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Die!” shouted a young ghostman girl named Qing Chi. She charged headlong into the fray, her small frame slamming into a skeletal warhorse, shattering bone and throwing its rider to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Bang! Bang! Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Her fists flew like a storm, smashing the bronze helmet of the lead ghost soldier and then crushing his skull in the same motion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Seeing their leader in danger, the other ghost soldiers lunged toward Qing Chi - only to be intercepted halfway by Qing Yan and his squad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Qing Chi killed the squad leader, then sprang to her feet. Her eyes blazed with fierce light, battle-lust burning like fire as she turned to look for her next opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">But what she saw was her father and the rest of the ghostman cultivators finishing off the last of the scout soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">They had already wiped out the whole patrol.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Qing Chi stood there, caught mid-motion, and shouted in frustration, “Hey! Leave some for me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The ghostman cultivators chuckled and teased, “Come on, young miss. You’re gunning for merit so you can impress your sweetheart. But we want achievements too. We can’t just hand over the credit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Qing Chi snorted. “Suit yourselves. When we run into real enemies, let’s see who can steal kills from me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">On the second night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Qing Yan’s team once again ambushed a squad of scout yin soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">But just as the battle began, a dozen heavily armored cavalry suddenly thundered in from the far side of the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Qing Chi’s eyes lit up with excitement instead of fear. “Perfect!” she shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Rather than dodging, she charged straight toward them. Mid-charge, her body ignited in green-blue flame as she burst upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">At the moment of collision, she leapt into the air, her toe tapping off a cavalryman’s spear before launching herself higher.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The green flames erupted in a chain of blasts among the heavy cavalry, searing through bronze armor and skeletal warhorses alike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">In just a few breaths, the entire cavalry unit was consumed by blue fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Qing Chi parted the waves of flame with glee. “Try stealing credit from me this time!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">But Qing Yan’s face had gone dark. He shouted, “Qing Chi! Are you trying to get yourself killed? Who told you to take a risk like that?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">On the third night - </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Qing Yan’s squad did not leave the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The tide of ghosts surged once more, crashing against the immortal city of White Paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">As part of the reinforcements, they stood atop the city walls, holding the line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Just as a wave of specters was about to scale the ramparts, Qing Chi stepped forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">She pressed her palms firmly against the bricks of the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In the next instant, scorching blue flames spread like creeping vines across the entire stretch of wall, incinerating every last ghost in their path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">From within the waves of flame, fiery begonia blossoms bloomed in full.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Burn, all of you! Burn!” Qing Chi’s eyes shone with a blue glow. Her voice was a whisper, but the flames at her hands roared ever stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The blue fire swept over the ramparts, surging downward to engulf the ghosts swarming at the base of the wall. A portion of the battlefield was instantly cleared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Such a display drew stares from both allies and enemies alike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The flames suddenly vanished. Qing Chi staggered, drenched in sweat and utterly spent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Qing Yan immediately appeared behind her, scooped up his daughter, and retreated to the rear. “How many times do I have to tell you? Stop risking your life like that!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Qing Chi gave a cheeky grin. “But Dad, that’s got to count for a big contribution, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Qing Yan gave a snort. “More or less. We’ll tally it properly after the battle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Qing Chi pouted. “Fine, tally it then!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">As the two walked off, they continued drawing glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“So that’s Qing Chi?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“The ghostman girl who’s been making waves lately. Still Foundation Establishment, but already fighting at Golden Core level!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Her flame teems with life force - pure poison to ghosts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Driven to fight with everything she had just for a chance to see her beloved, the young girl had stunned the battlefield and become the brightest star of the city’s defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Back at Vigorous Yang Manor, security remained tight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">It had been two days since Chen Sui’s assassination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Perhaps it was because Wen Ruanyu had mobilized enough men and imposed strict surveillance, or perhaps the traitor had gone quiet on their own, but no further assassinations had occurred in the meantime.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Gradually, tensions at the Manor began to ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo’s days passed quietly but with no lack of urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">While the other consorts poured their yang energy into the Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation, swallowing vast quantities of vitality elixirs and competing ruthlessly, Ning Zhuo devoted himself to cultivating his soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Though he hadn’t trained in this particular path, he held four treasures at the Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">He slowly opened his eyes. Dark and fathomless, his pupils flickered with strands of ghostly light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">“I’ve broken through.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">“I’ve reached Million Man Soul.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo’s heart surged with joy. He lowered his gaze to his arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">His skin had turned a greenish gray, ghostly energy rising from its surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">And he knew - this wasn’t just his arm. His entire body was like this now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“My soul foundation has grown so powerful it’s nearly surpassed the limits of my physical body.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">“I need to ease off and focus more on the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">“I’ll admit, the current Lord of White Paper is surprisingly generous. Even now, I’ve got more than half of the four soul cultivation treasures left.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">“Boss, are you sure you don’t want to walk the path of soul path cultivation?” he couldn’t help but ask again through Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Sun Lingtong refused once more, then changed the topic to something more amusing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">During his cultivation, Ning Zhuo never checked in on Sun Lingtong’s situation. But as part of the ghost army, Sun had witnessed Qing Chi’s fierce brilliance in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">He warned Ning Zhuo, “That girl’s a real fighter! Even our side’s paying attention now. If she keeps growing like this, her blue flame will be a nightmare for ghosts. We’ve already compiled a ton of intel on her.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">“You’re in that intel too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">“Apparently she made a bet with her dad and is fighting tooth and nail to earn enough merit to come see you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo’s brows knit together. “What?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Sun Lingtong let out a mischievous chuckle. “Don’t look so stressed. Word is she’s almost there.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo frowned even deeper, a headache blooming behind his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">He glanced around and muttered inwardly, “I can’t stay here anymore. I need to find somewhere to hide.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">He had already been planning to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">His first stop was the City Lord’s Estate. There, he used the Vice City Lord Seal to probe the area, trying to trigger one of White Paper Immortal City’s hidden formations - but no reaction came. He didn’t receive any benefits from the paper-man avatar system.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Still, Ning Zhuo wasn’t ready to give up. He knew the underworld held many blank paper men.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">So he headed next to the paper statue stationed at the South Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The giant had been under round-the-clock repairs and was now more or less restored to its original form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Ning Zhuo passed through the area unhindered and entered the interior of the statue once again, where he met with the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">He poured spiritual power into it and focused his divine sense upon it. Suddenly, a hidden formation activated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">In the next moment, his mother’s voice emerged from within the lantern.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
