<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Faced with Ning Jiufan's doubts and concerns, Ning Zhuo immediately put on a bitter expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">He said in an aggrieved tone: "Ancestor, how deep of a misunderstanding do you have of me?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Since establishing the branch family, leaving my hometown, and venturing out on adventures, it has all been for the sake of our familiesâ€™ plans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"The Jade Steel Mountain business was obtained through my careful deliberation, maneuvering in all directions, thinking it over many times, and exerting both mental and physical effort in a series of negotiations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Although I have traveled far from home, I have never forgotten the family or my responsibilities as the head of the branch family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Jiufan couldn't help but nod slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Facts speak louder than words!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Jiufan had witnessed firsthand how the Ning family branch in Fire Persimmon Immortal City had made the jade-infused dark steel business flourish like wildfire. To the extent that many people from the main family line were envious of this and said many sour words about it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo had already sent a letter to Ning Jiufan when he left Cloud Concealment Mountain, informing him of roughly what had happened on the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">When Ning Jiufan received the letter at that time, after reading it once, he couldn't help but smile. He was very satisfied with Ning Zhuo's performance on Cloud Concealment Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Jiufan nodded: "You did indeed do well with the matters on Cloud Concealment Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo smiled: "Ancestor, this time, I want to emulate what we did on Cloud Concealment Mountain and seek more cooperation with the Myriad Medicine Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Jiufan stroked his beard and pondered: "Fire Persimmon Mountain and Ten Thousand Medicines Valley are quite far apart. Setting up a teleportation array would be very costly. But relying on post stations and trade routes carries even more risks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"The Myriad Medicine Sect's business is thriving, they don't necessarily need us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"These two factors are major obstacles to our cooperation with the Myriad Medicine Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Clearly, since reading Ning Zhuo's letter, Ning Jiufan had also been contemplating this cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo nodded: "Ancestor, your words hit the nail on the head. To the Myriad Medicine Sect, our Ning family is dispensable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"But our Ning family also doesn't have anything particularly impressive to offer that would make the Myriad Medicine Sect eager to cooperate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"After much thought, I figured if we have nothing to trade, then we'll sell our services!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Ancestor, the Myriad Medicine Sect is weak in combat strength, which is why they specifically arranged for Little Contention Peak to gain support from external cultivators. Some of their Golden Core level elders are also recruited from outside."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"These are not their own people, so while these outsiders are used, they are also guarded against."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"If our Ning family becomes a close ally of the Myriad Medicine Sect, we could gain more trust than these external cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Jiufan: "How so?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo explained: "Firstly, our Ning family has a foundation. You can run away from the monk but not the temple. From this point, we are naturally more trustworthy than scattered cultivators or demonic cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Secondly, we are quite far from the Myriad Medicine Sect, so we won't have friction in daily operations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Thirdly, our Ning family once received help from the Myriad Medicine Sect during our migration. Such old friendship is also worthy of more mutual trust."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Jiufan nodded slightly, acknowledging Ning Zhuo's analysis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"But even so, negotiating with Lin Bufan might not go too well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"I've met this person a few times. He's very deep and quite shrewd, a practical talent among Nascent Soul cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"We are now the ones seeking out the Myriad Medicine Sect, taking the initiative to negotiate. Lin Bu Fan will surely drive a hard bargain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Jiufan understood Lin Bufan much better than Ning Zhuo did.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo pondered: "Perhaps we could spread rumors proclaiming that the Myriad Medicine Sect is in a dangerous situation'?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Jiufan immediately shook his head: "That won't do."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Lin Bufan lives up to his name, he's very capable. He's much older than you, and this is his territory that he has carefully managed for many years."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"He would easily see through the rumors and trace them back to the source."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"If we really did that, it would backfire."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo nodded, immediately abandoning his previous idea. After all, he hadn't even met Lin Bufan once, while Ning Jiufan had interacted with Lin Bufan many more times than he had.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Jiufan stared at Ning Zhuo with a smile: "Little Zhuo, do you still have the Ice Heart Jade Gourd? How much longer do you need to borrow it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo just chuckled and took out the Ice Heart Jade Gourd, offering it with both hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Without any explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Instead, after taking back the Ice Heart Jade Gourd, Ning Jiufan explained to Ning Zhuo: "This gourd is an important inherited treasure of our Ning clan, benefiting the entire clan. Keeping it to yourself doesn't allow it to reach its full potential."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "To be precise, it is of extraordinary significance to the Ning family's main branch who have cultivated the Ice Heart Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">When the Ice Heart Technique is successfully cultivated, the foundation of the upper dantian in the spirit sea often far exceeds the other two dantians. In this case, drinking the ice jade wine produced by the Ice Heart Jade Gourd can save cultivators a lot of hard work, allowing the cultivation of the upper dantian to drive the other two dantians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Since Ning Zhuo had sent a letter summoning the Ning family ancestor, he naturally had mental preparation for this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">To be honest, after the Ice Heart Jade Gourd fell into his hands, he also found that it wasn't of much use to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Its greatest uses were two: one was to produce ice jade wine, and the other was to enhance healing effects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">For the former, Ning Zhuo had already emptied out the ice jade wine when exchanging the gourd. For the latter, in terms of healing, Ning Zhuo had the Floating Ice White Jade Hand as a perfect substitute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Empty?" The Ning family ancestor swept his divine sense across the empty Ice Heart Jade Gourd. He couldn't help but be surprised: "What did you need so much ice jade wine for?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Even if sold, it's only suitable for cultivators who practice frost techniques and have outstanding spirit sea cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"This wine has never sold well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Jiufan reminded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">A treasure suitable for the Ning family is not necessarily suitable for others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Especially in the Southern Bean Kingdom located in the south, where the air is humid and warm, the number of cultivators practicing ice attribute techniques is scarce, far fewer than those practicing wood or earth techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"I have my own use for this wine." At this moment, Ning Zhuo showed his stubbornness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Jiufan nodded, not pursuing the matter further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Are you kidding?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Pursue the matter with Ning Zhuo?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Jiufan was clear in his heart that although Ning Zhuo was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage, his combat power had reached the Golden Core level, and even peaked among Golden Core cultivators!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Those few mechanical creations, especially the Night Rain Demon Weapon... Ning Jiufan had witnessed them personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">So, ever since the dispute over the Lava Immortal Palace temporarily concluded, Ning Jiufan's attitude towards Ning Zhuo had undergone a major change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Before, he completely regarded Ning Zhuo as an outstanding younger generation of his family. But now, in his heart, Ning Zhuo deserved to be treated as an equal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Ancestor, take a look at this." Ning Zhuo took out a jade slip and handed it to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Poison Flame Chrysanthemum?" Ning Jiufan swept his divine sense over it, and the smile on his face grew, "This is a good thing, I will stand up for the branch family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">However, Ning Zhuo said: "At present, my branch family has limited manpower. The main focus is on the operation of jade-infused dark steel, and a small part of the people rely on the Lava Immortal Palace to guard their own positions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"So, for this Poison Flame Chrysanthemum business, I'm willing to cooperate with the main branch to operate it together!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Oh? You're willing to share?" Ning Jiufan was surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "The cultivation of mere flowers, compared to future prospects, is just a small profit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"If we only use the manpower of my branch family, it's not enough. Forget about a few months, even in two or three years, there wouldn't be much progress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Ancestor, my cultivation now requires more and more funds. I urgently need capital. The more capital, the better!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"So, we should expand the scale of the Poison Flame Chrysanthemum as much as possible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"However, if the main branch wants to participate, it must be under the lead of my branch family. In terms of profit, my branch family gets eight, the main branch gets two."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Jiufan glared: "An 80-20 split?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo waved his hand: "Non-negotiable! If the Ning family's main branch doesn't agree, then I'll cooperate with the Zhou family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Jiufan snorted coldly: "We share the Ning surname, Little Zhuo, you seem a bit harsh on your own family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo then sneered, directly giving Ning Jiufan attitude: "Since I became aware, the Ning family main branch has always treated me like this. An eye for an eye, karma is just heavenly principle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Jiufan sighed and changed the subject: "You used the black market and the Lava Immortal Palace to amass wealth on a large scale, how come in just a few months, your resources are already tight?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo then untied the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon from his waist and showed it to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"A Nascent Soul level mechanism! This is... Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon? Good stuff!" Ning Jiufan recognized it and marveled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He had early guesses in his heart, and now seeing the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, he wasn't too surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">At the same time, he also understood the reason for Ning Zhuo's financial strain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo then told him that this Ten Thousand Li Dragon mechanism should originally be driven by a Nascent Soul. Now, it could only be substituted with fire essence, and each use consumed a huge amount. By now, he was almost unable to sustain it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Jiufan reprimanded him: "For ordinary travel, why use the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon? This behavior is too extravagant. The real scenario to use it should be when you're in danger and need the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to escape."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo didn't tell Ning Jiufan that for the sake of his mother, in his urgency, he directly traveled at maximum speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"With the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to protect you, I can be at ease. As for fire essence, I have some news on my side that might be useful." Ning Jiufan then told him about a ten-thousand-year fire essence that had appeared in Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Meng Kui was gathering Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou family and Ning family, and had already taken Ning Jiufan's Fire Core Pomegranate to set up a trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"This ten-thousand-year fire essence already has a strong spirituality. If you, Little Zhuo, had this, it should greatly reduce the consumption of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"As long as the ten-thousand-year fire essence doesn't completely perish, it can quickly recover by absorbing spiritual energy from the outside world."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up, but then he looked worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">This was indeed good news, but how could he get the ten-thousand-year fire essence from under Meng Kuiâ€™s nose?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After careful communication with the ancestor, Ning Zhuo also learned: Aunt Xi's injuries persisted, and if she participated in the struggle for the ten-thousand-year fire essence, she might be outmaneuvered by Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">If anything untoward happened to Aunt Xi, then Ning Jiufan and the Ning family would truly have lost both the wife and the army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Given the current situation, we must let Aunt Xi fully recover before we have a chance of self-preservation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"On the basis of ensuring self-preservation, perhaps we can rely on Aunt Xi to get the ten-thousand-year fire essence!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo and Ning Jiufan reached an agreement on this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Jiufan inquired about Ning Zhuo's recent situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo handed over all the intelligence he had collected about the Myriad Medicine Sect to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He also told the truth about his own experiences to prevent Ning Jiufan from misjudging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">After listening, he was silent for a moment, then glared and said: "Even Lin Bufan's precious daughter was confined because of you. You still say you didn't cause trouble?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo defended himself: "Miss Lin and I hit it off immediately. Friends helping each other is a testament to friendship."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Jiufan snorted, then suddenly said: "So, this Poison Flame Chrysanthemum cultivation method was also secretly given to you by Lin Shanshan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head: "Of course not. This cultivation method came from Hua Guzi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
