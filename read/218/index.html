<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 218: The True Scripture is Still on Yuan Dasheng</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo's subordinates were in a state of panic, but Ning Zhuo could no longer concern himself with these trivial matters.<br/>
<br/>
He was the only one left in the room.<br/>
<br/>
The young man's face was still very pale, devoid of any blood.<br/>
<br/>
His brows were tightly furrowed, his eyes shut, and his eyelids occasionally twitched.<br/>
<br/>
Countless thoughts churned in his mind as he desperately tried to piece everything together.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was racing against time!<br/>
<br/>
This time, he was in a life-and-death situation.<br/>
<br/>
Every minute and every second of effort might influence the final outcome.<br/>
<br/>
He recalled everything that had just happened, remembering Zhu Xuanji's questions and his demeanor.<br/>
<br/>
"Zhu Xuanji first asked if Yuan Dasheng was killed by me, then asked where the Demonic True Scripture was." "Following this sequence," Ning Zhuo pondered Zhu Xuanji's logical thinking.<br/>
<br/>
"In Zhu Xuanji's view, Yuan Dasheng must have had the Demonic True Scripture on him."<br/>
<br/>
"True Scripture..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo knew about this.<br/>
<br/>
It was common knowledge in the cultivation world.<br/>
<br/>
This was scripture written with true intent.<br/>
<br/>
Even someone who couldn't read a single word could comprehend all the profound meanings within the scripture upon contact.<br/>
<br/>
True Scriptures had the characteristic of automatic transmission.<br/>
<br/>
When their current vessel encountered issues or a more suitable vessel appeared, the True Scripture would automatically transfer from the old vessel to the new one.<br/>
<br/>
"Generally speaking, if the vessel carrying the True Scripture gets damaged, the True Scripture is likely to transfer out."<br/>
<br/>
"But Yuan Dasheng died right in front of me, and no True Scripture emerged." "What exactly is the Demonic True Scripture that Zhu Xuanji is after?" "Could it be the Demonic Blood Vein Technique?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn't help but think of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.<br/>
<br/>
He also thought of Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
All along, he had never understood why Yuan Dasheng possessed the cultivation of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.<br/>
<br/>
"Since Zhu Xuanji asked me like this, it's very likely that Yuan Dasheng's mastery of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique was due to this True Scripture." "Zhu Xuanji found me because Yuan Dasheng's corpse ultimately ended up in my hands." This made Ning Zhuo's heart waver.<br/>
<br/>
He originally thought that Zhu Xuanji's investigation had ended.<br/>
<br/>
Unexpectedly, Zhu Xuanji followed the clues on Yuan Dasheng and found Ning Zhuo again.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo calmed his mind and continued to think.<br/>
<br/>
"The current question is, how did Zhu Xuanji know about this clue?" "Something significant must have happened during this period."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was unaware of Zhu Xuanji leading three Golden Core cultivators into the depths of the mountain for a battle.<br/>
<br/>
His intelligence capabilities were limited, and a large part of it relied on the Turtle Breath Gang's investigations.<br/>
<br/>
The strongest person around him for gathering intelligence was Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
However, even Sun Lingtong found it difficult to gather information at the Golden Core level.<br/>
<br/>
Especially after Zhu Xuanji and the others returned, they kept their actions strictly confidential, and no one knew anything.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had proactively submitted a letter of apology to the Ning family patriarch, Ning Jiufan, seeking assistance and also probing for information.<br/>
<br/>
In his view, Ning Jiufan, being at the Golden Core Stage, should know something given Zhu Xuanji's close relationship with the three families.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had indeed asked the right person!<br/>
<br/>
But clearly, Ning Jiufan would never publicize his own matters.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo received Ning Jiufan's reply, he found that it contained only a few short lines.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan instructed him to cooperate well with Lord Zhu Xuanji, reflect on himself within these three days, and finally give Zhu Xuanji a perfect explanation.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it!" Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth in frustration.<br/>
<br/>
He had not obtained any information and felt as if he had been abandoned by the Ning family patriarch.<br/>
<br/>
At such a critical moment, even a tiny bit of crucial information would be immensely helpful to him.<br/>
<br/>
But he got nothing from Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
"Right, there's also the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!"<br/>
<br/>
"Yuan Dasheng's corpse was refined in the Lava Immortal Palace and ultimately became the Golden Blood Battle Ape." Ning Zhuo activated the Floating Cloud Cloak, and his body was once again shrouded in layers of floating clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Just as he was about to enter the Immortal Palace to contact the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, he heard a message from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
It was the Medical Pavilion Master's token!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was surprised and immediately realized that the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's message was conveyed through the token.<br/>
<br/>
"Little, little master." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit feigned weakness.<br/>
<br/>
It was about to speak about the life-and-death crisis triggered by Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo interrupted it directly: "Don't say anything else, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, first tell me, where is the True Scripture on Yuan Dasheng?" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit paused.<br/>
<br/>
It had already prepared for Ning Zhuo's demand for the True Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
Without any hesitation, it answered directly: "Little master, the True Scripture related to the Demonic Blood Vein Technique is on Yuan Dasheng." "But it cannot be extracted because it has completely become a part of Yuan Dasheng's spirit."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned and quickly asked, "Why is that?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit explained: "In the Lava Immortal Palace, there are many furnaces, the highest grade being the Golden Furnace." "The Golden Furnace was personally set up by the three sect leaders, with eight in total, but now only three remain."<br/>
<br/>
"One of them was destroyed because it was used to refine Yuan Dasheng."<br/>
<br/>
"Only a device like the Golden Furnace can refine supreme talents."<br/>
<br/>
"And at that time, the True Scripture of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique was lurking within Yuan Dasheng's bones."<br/>
<br/>
"The Golden Furnace refines everything, using all of Yuan Dasheng's essence as nourishment, ultimately transforming into the Golden Blood Battle Ape mechanism." "One could say the True Scripture was destroyed, but it could also be said that the True Scripture has become a part of Yuan Dasheng."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was still puzzled and continued to ask, "Yuan Dasheng was already dead at that time, why didn't the scripture transfer out?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit explained that Yuan Dasheng's immortal bones were exceptionally sturdy, making his bones an excellent vessel for the True Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
Even after Yuan Dasheng's death, his bones remained uncorrupted and could still carry the True Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
Unless a better vessel appeared, the True Scripture would not transfer out.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and continued to ask, "Before this, where was the True Scripture? Why did it transfer out from the Lava Immortal Palace?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit originally didn't want to reveal these secrets to Ning Zhuo, but now that Ning Zhuo had asked, it had no choice but to answer.<br/>
<br/>
After all, it needed Ning Zhuo's help!<br/>
<br/>
So it replied: "The Lava Immortal Palace had three Golden Core-level combat mechanisms, all mechanical puppets."<br/>
<br/>
"They were the Buddha Healer, Dao Master, and Demon General."<br/>
<br/>
"Unlike other mechanical constructs, these three were personally crafted by the old master."<br/>
<br/>
"The old master placed three True Scriptures on them, corresponding to the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, and Demonic Blood Vein Technique." "During the long period of suppressing Fire Persimmon Mountain, the Buddha Healer and Demon General were lost one after another." "Now only the Dao Master puppet remains in the Lava Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately had a guess: "So, Zhu Xuanji found the Demon General mechanism and obtained crucial clues from it, ultimately leading to Yuan Dasheng." "Yuan Dasheng must have accidentally encountered the Demon General mechanism in Fire Persimmon Mountain, which is how he obtained the True Scripture."<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit suddenly spoke urgently: "Little master, my condition is not good, I am about to lose contact with you." "I reached out to you this time because of a sudden major crisis."<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit quickly informed Ning Zhuo about Ning Xiaohui's movements and the existence of the Historical Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's brows furrowed deeply, feeling as if a heavy stone was pressing on his heart.<br/>
<br/>
When it rains, it pours!<br/>
<br/>
He had personally detonated the Immortal Palace, and there must be records in the Historical Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Xiaohui really obtained a position in the Historical Pavilion, Ning Zhuo would be directly exposed.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was, in the Immortal Palace, only Ning Xiaohui had the status of a trial disciple.<br/>
<br/>
Only trial disciples had the opportunity to obtain positions in the Historical Pavilion, Medical Pavilion, and other places.<br/>
<br/>
Others, even Golden Core cultivators, were treated differently.<br/>
<br/>
This meant that no one could compete with Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui becoming a member of the Historical Pavilion, even if not the pavilion master, was a certainty.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was already racking his brains to deal with Zhu Xuanji's investigation, and now he was hit with another major crisis.<br/>
<br/>
Without a doubt, Ning Xiaohui brought another life-and-death crisis to him!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo asked the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: "As the palace spirit, can't you stop Ning Xiaohui's actions?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit replied honestly: "I cannot do that."<br/>
<br/>
"I cannot reveal any information about trial disciples."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately noticed the contradiction: "If that's the case, how did you reveal Ning Xiaohui's movements to me?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit replied honestly: "I can only say, this is your fate energy!" "Ning Xiaohui is your subordinate, she is a medical officer in the Medical Pavilion, and you are the pavilion master." "Because of this relationship, you have the right to know about your subordinate's movements."<br/>
<br/>
"Little master..." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit said this and then cut off the connection.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how Ning Zhuo called its name afterward, it did not respond.<br/>
<br/>
In the short time of communicating with Ning Zhuo, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was already trembling with fear!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was so sharp, even in a life-and-death situation, he remained calm and composed, easily detecting the flaws in the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's words.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit dared not continue speaking.<br/>
<br/>
"A little monster like Ning Zhuo has already obtained enough information from me." "Now, let's see how he performs."<br/>
<br/>
"Hurry and stop Ning Xiaohui, don't let me down!"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit never expected that there would come a day when it would pin its hopes of regaining freedom on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Under the sweeping tide of events, the situation in the Lava Immortal Palace had also slipped out of the control of this palace spirit.<br/>
