<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 107: Three Families' Joint Investigation</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Is this all the evidence?" Zhu Xuanji arrived at the Zhou family estate. The head of the Zhou family personally received him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zhu Xuanji wasted no time, stating that he had rushed over immediately upon hearing about the attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"This might be the work of the Shadow Demon cultivator! According to our previous suspicions, someone has secretly released them," the Zhou family head said gravely. "This is a hidden, evil force lurking in the shadows. If we hadn't discovered it in time, I'm afraid our two Qi Refining geniuses would have perished."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Zhu Xuanji examined the dead ants in his hand, his eyes glowing with golden light as he activated the Trace Back Technique. He remained silent throughout.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Zhou family head, hopeful, asked if he had found anything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zhu Xuanji shook his head. "The evidence from your family alone is not enough. I'll need to check with the other families."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zhu Xuanji then visited the City Lord's mansion, the Zheng family, and Ning Zhuo's small courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">As expected, the results of his investigation were consistent across the board. There were many cluesâ€”too many, in fact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The problem lay precisely in this abundance of clues. The Trace Back Technique could detect closely related objects, but such close relationships could stem from multiple sources. For instance, from the toxic residue found in Ning Xiaohui, Zhu Xuanji traced it back to the raw materials, the herb-cooking boys, and the medicine-delivering servants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Does this alone prove that the herb-cooking boys and the medicine-delivering servants are the culprits? No, it does not.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Could it be determined they are not the culprits? Also no, because they might have secretly added poison while cooking or delivering the medicine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Trace Back Technique could only uncover leads. To delve deeper, Zhu Xuanji would have to rely on various investigative methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">However, Zhu Xuanji decided to halt his investigation. There were simply too many clues. If he continued, the time and effort required would be overwhelming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhu Xuanji suspected that the abundance of clues was intentionally set up by the culprits to delay his investigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Just like the incident during the Fire Persimmon Festival where the mechanized monkey attacked Yuan Er, Zhu Xuanji traced back many clues from the remnants of those mechanized fire-bombing monkeys. Were these clues useful? Only marginally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhu Xuanji preferred seeing only a few clues under the Trace Back Technique. The fewer the clues, the more valuable they were for further investigation! But now, each piece of evidence had so many leads, making the culprit's intention to counter the Trace Back Technique very clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">However, this was something Zhu Xuanji had anticipated. As the fame of the Trace Back Technique grew, many powerful individuals or factions would consciously prepare defenses against it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">All techniques in the world are merely tools to help cultivators achieve their goals. As tools, they can be countered. It is the invincible cultivator, not the invincible technique, that stands out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Initially hoping the culprit would slip up was a bit naive on my part," Zhu Xuanji mused, deciding to proceed with his original investigation plan despite the recent events. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Perhaps my methodical investigation is putting pressure on the culprit, prompting these attacks to divert my attention!" Zhu Xuanji's brow furrowed. Throughout his investigation, he felt something was amiss, but he couldn't pinpoint what it was. When he tried to think it through, the unsettling feeling disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Zhu Xuanji's subsequent actions left the heads of the three families disappointed. They secretly convened to discuss their next steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"The Divine Inspector Zhu is truly disappointing," one remarked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Perhaps he has already identified the responsible faction but is constrained by his position from making it public."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"What do you mean?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The three family heads fell silent. Although not explicitly stated, they all understood it pointed to the City Lord's mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">In both attacks, the City Lord's mansion suffered the least, or more accurately, benefited from the misfortunes. Meng Chong's success in eliminating the assassins twice had significantly boosted his reputation, overshadowing the Qi Refining talents of the other three families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Since Meng Kui took office, he has maintained good relations with our three families. This time, it may not have been his doing. After all, Meng Chong has consistently led in the exploration of the Immortal Palace," the Zheng family head said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Ning family head analyzed, "Last time, I indeed suspected the City Lord's mansion. But this time, the intensity of the assassination attempt, aiming to kill all the Qi Refining talents of our three families, suggests there may indeed be a hidden force with malicious intent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Zhou family head shook his head and let out a cold laugh, "None of our talented juniors from the three families died, did they? Even if someone had died, could we trace it back to the City Lord's mansion?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He sighed deeply, "The Meng family is a significant family in our Southern Bean Immortal Kingdom. Meng family cultivators are known for their aggressive and domineering nature. Particularly, the four generals of the Meng family are all battle-hardened, with numerous kills to their names. Apart from the other three fierce generals, Meng Kui, who seems gentle and friendly, is also one of them, but this is merely a facade. Think about it, since he took office, have our three families had a comfortable time? Isn't it much more oppressive compared to previous City Lords? Have you investigated Meng Kui's past battle reports? He is even better at scheming than our Zhou family and has a nickname, 'Mountain Chancellor'. Do you think someone like him is easy to deal with?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The Ning family head nodded thoughtfully, "Now that you mention it, I have had similar feelings. The City Lord's mansion was the first to discover the Lava Immortal Palace. Then it was the Zhou and Zheng families. According to our intelligence, your two families privately bribed Meng Kui heavily to prevent him from reporting it to the court. But think about it, if Meng Kui had reported it immediately upon discovery, would we have any involvement? On the surface, it seems like the Zhou and Zheng families sought his cooperation, but could this have been part of his scheme all along?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The Zheng family head snorted, "Very likely! Meng Kui is actually more difficult to deal with than other Meng family members because he is more insidious. Using the Lava Immortal Palace, he has made our three families cooperate actively with him, allowing him to govern the Immortal City smoothly and harmoniously over the years. Previously, he deliberately released information and relaxed surveillance, attracting countless rogue cultivators and wandering cultivators to explore the Crimson Flame Demon Cave. Over the years, countless people have died. These people used their lives to fill the void, killing countless Crimson Flame Demons, which reduced the pressure on the Immortal Palace and allowed the City Lord's mansion to gradually acquire detailed information about the Immortal Palace and the Crimson Flame Demon Cave. If the City Lord's mansion had worked alone, by now, their city guards would have been wiped out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The Zhou family head added, "Since the Lava Immortal Palace emerged, Meng Kui has personally sat in the seat, suppressing the palace and forbidding anyone from approaching. Hmph! His excuse is impeccable and righteous, but in reality, he has completely prevented our three families' cultivators from entering the Immortal Palace to explore its secrets." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Previously, for the Zhou and Zheng family cultivators to enter the Immortal Palace, it was a cumbersome process. They had to climb to the top of the volcano, enter the Crimson Flame Demon Cave, and choose the correct path to enter the palace inside the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">In the end, cultivators came into contact with the Immortal Palace but couldn't break through. Only those skilled in mechanisms, already recognized by the Palace Spirit, could enter the palace. Originally, with the emergence of the Immortal Palace, cultivators from the three families could conveniently enter and leave. But with Meng Kui personally suppressing it, the three families were unable to access the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Although the City Lord's mansion also didn't have cultivators entering the palace, the three families were well aware that in this area, the City Lord's mansion's competitiveness was far less than that of the Qi Refining stage. In the Qi Refining stage competition, Meng Chong had a celestial talentâ€”this advantage was tremendous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The head of the Zhou family, with a sincere expression, said, "At this stage, finding the real culprit is not as important. The critical thing is the Lava Immortal Palace!" The other two family heads nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Zhou family head pressed on, "We can only counter the City Lord's mansion by uniting and cooperating more closely. To show my sincerity, I am willing to fully open the Gather-Disperse Spirit Qi Formation for use by your families." The heads of the Ning and Zheng families were somewhat surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Previously, during negotiations, the head of the Zhou family had been reluctant to open up the Gathering and Dispelling Spirit Qi Formation. Unexpectedly, the severe injuries sustained by the Zhou family's two talents during the assassination attempt had prompted the Zhou family head to make this decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Alright," the Zheng family head clapped his hands. "In that case, I will offer our family's prized possessionâ€”the Sharp Advancement Needles." The Ning family head nodded, "Then our Ning family will present the Ice Light Reinforcement Talismans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Gather-Disperse Spirit Qi Formation could help cultivators better accumulate and circulate their Qi. The Sharp Advancement Needles could preemptively expand a cultivator's internal channels during the Qi Refining stage, saving them the effort of slowly carving them out. The Ice Light Reinforcement Talismans could coat a cultivator's internal channels with a layer of ice light, allowing them to circulate Qi at a speed 30% above their limit without risking damage to their channels from the increased Qi flow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The talents from the three families had been injured in succession and needed time to recover. They urgently needed other members of their cultivation teams to improve their levels. These assassination attempts made the three family heads acutely aware of the fierce competition and the strength and ruthlessness of their opponents. They decided to lower their pride and engage in more active cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">At the Ning family estate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">In the dining room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Mother, how much longer do we have to wait?" Ning Ji had just reached out with his chopsticks to pick up some food when his mother, Wang Lan, smacked his hand with her chopsticks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Ji, in pain, quickly withdrew his hand. Wang Lan glared at her son, "What's wrong with waiting a bit longer? Your father is still in the private prison. How can you even think of eating?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Ji, holding his hand, protested, "But there's no need to wait for Ning Zhuo to come before we eat. We never had this rule before. Didn't we always start eating first?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Wang Lan snorted, "How can now compare to the past? Ning Zhuo is highly regarded by the young clan leader. If he speaks a few good words for your father, pleads for some leniency, your father might be released!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
