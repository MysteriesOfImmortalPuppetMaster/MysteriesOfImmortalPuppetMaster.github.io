<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head. “Not a good idea. Too many people already know I have these needs. If these precious materials are stolen, I’ll be the first suspect.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shrugged. “Then I’ll just wipe out their entire stock. Problem solved.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out a deep sigh. “Stealing under the noses of Nascent Soul cultivators is far too risky.”<br/>
<br/>
“But if we have no other choice, it may come to that.”<br/>
<br/>
“Forget it, let’s not talk about this now. Boss, please guard me.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded eagerly. “Little Zhuo, go ahead and comprehend. I’ll watch over you.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a few steps forward and approached the Spirit Concealment Willow.<br/>
<br/>
Sensing his presence, the willow swayed its branches, gently brushing against his face.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled warmly, feeling the tree’s welcome. “Ah, my dear willow, you’ve missed me in these few days, haven’t you? I’ll need your help again this time to assist me in tasting the Bitter Water. Only by growing stronger will I be able to provide you with a better environment.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong giggled. “Brother, you’re funny. What are you chatting with a tree for? Hurry and drink the water.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo turned back and glanced at him. “Boss, ever since I first laid eyes on this tree, I felt a sense of closeness. It’s like I can’t help but talk to it.”<br/>
<br/>
“Maybe it’s because I’ve practiced the Funeral Prajna Spirit-Resolving Sutra. The more I cultivate, the more I feel that all things have their own spirit. For something like this Spirit Concealment Willow, its wisdom should be even more profound. It can enlighten us, even though it can’t speak or gesture.”<br/>
<br/>
“To be honest, every time I talk to it, my heart becomes calm and tranquil.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shrugged again. “Well, it’s a good way for you to adjust your state for comprehension.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stopped speaking and took out a meditation mat, sitting cross-legged.<br/>
<br/>
He also took out a small jade bottle containing a little bit of Bitter Water.<br/>
<br/>
After calming his breath and adjusting his mind, his heart became as still as a calm lake. His thoughts were clear and undisturbed.<br/>
<br/>
He uncorked the bottle and slowly poured the Bitter Water into his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
The moment it touched his tongue, the bitterness was beyond words!<br/>
<br/>
This bitterness was not just a matter of taste; it struck deep into his soul. His throat burned, and it felt as though his very spirit was howling in agony.<br/>
<br/>
As the water slid down his throat, it seemed to transform into a frigid stream, swiftly spreading throughout his body. A chill like none he had ever felt before surged from his stomach, radiating to his limbs, bringing with it an unbearable coldness and shivering.<br/>
<br/>
His heartbeat accelerated, cold sweat dripped from his forehead, and his body began to tremble involuntarily.<br/>
<br/>
In his mind, scenes of his past sins and wrongdoings began to surface—those he had hurt or owed a debt to, mistakes he had made. The images were vivid and unavoidable, forcing him to confront each one.<br/>
<br/>
The faces of the three Huang family ghosts, Ning Zhanji, Ning Ji, Ning Ze, Ning Xiaohui, Zhu Xuanji, Meng Chong, the Black Wind Tiger Demon, Deputy Fox God of Mount Shan, Lin Shanshan... All these memories resurfaced with painful clarity.<br/>
<br/>
The voices of those he had ignored, the regret and guilt buried deep in his heart, began to whisper and weep around him.<br/>
<br/>
An invisible pressure weighed down on him, as if countless hands were tugging at his soul, trying to drag him into the abyss of his sins.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong noticed Ning Zhuo’s pained expression, his face twisted in agony, tears streaming from his tightly shut eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Worried, Sun Lingtong clenched his fists, silently calling out, “Little Zhuo!”<br/>
<br/>
He was extremely anxious, but could only watch helplessly.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he heard Ning Zhuo let out a cold snort.<br/>
<br/>
Under the Spirit Concealment Willow, the young man in white had a face as cold as ice. The earlier pain and torment seemed to be frozen over, no longer visible.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, filled with a fierce determination.<br/>
<br/>
He sneered inwardly. “All things in heaven and earth are in competition. The path of cultivation seems vast, with countless techniques, but there’s only one true path: the path of victory!”<br/>
<br/>
“Whether it’s the righteous, demonic, or devil’s path, strength is the only law. Only when I’m strong enough will people deal with me kindly and speak of rules and reason.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I had been strong enough, I could have saved my mother at Fire Persimmon Mountain. Why would I need to run around like this?”<br/>
<br/>
“Only by becoming stronger can I secure the future. A mere Bitter Water cannot shake my will!”<br/>
<br/>
“To succeed, I must keep pushing forward, never wavering.”<br/>
<br/>
People react differently to hardship. Some draw strength from adversity, growing ever stronger, their will unshakable, believing every difficulty is just a temporary trial. They press on, knowing that with determination, even the greatest challenge is merely another test of life.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo was only sixteen, his life had been filled with harshness. He was often neglected and mistreated. He had to hide his true self constantly, endure separation from his mother, and undergo trials under Sun Lingtong’s teachings. He also had to rack his brain to figure out how to deal with enemies far stronger than himself, like those at the Golden Core or Nascent Soul stage.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, he was merely in the Qi Refining stage!<br/>
<br/>
The Bitter Cold Sutra was all about drawing strength from suffering, using it to strengthen oneself, ultimately achieving self-liberation.<br/>
<br/>
Wasn’t Ning Zhuo’s entire sixteen years a journey of self-liberation?<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou was right—Ning Zhuo truly resonated with the essence of the Bitter Cold Sutra.<br/>
<br/>
His Buddha Heart Demon Seal was only a shallow defense. His true nature was always this unyielding!<br/>
<br/>
No matter how poor or weak I am, no matter how powerful the enemies, they cannot crush my will. I’ll only treat all of this as sharpening stones, as the swamp that hides a dragon preparing to soar.<br/>
<br/>
“The finest swords are forged in the harshest of conditions, and the plum blossoms emit their fragrance only after enduring the bitter cold.”<br/>
<br/>
This bitterness, after careful reflection, even seemed to have a hint of sweetness.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did Ning Zhuo stabilize his emotions, but he also used this as an opportunity to further temper his will.<br/>
<br/>
The truth behind the Bitter Water flowed through him like a great river.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly grasped the essence of techniques like Frost Fist, Cold Leg, Suffering Body, Bitter Force, and others.<br/>
<br/>
Once he understood the essence, it was natural for him to incorporate these techniques into his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo completed his comprehension and stood up, Sun Lingtong immediately approached to check on him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes sparkled, his mind having undergone a transformation, and his whole being felt renewed. “Boss, I’m feeling fantastic.”<br/>
<br/>
He glanced back at the Spirit Concealment Willow.<br/>
<br/>
Only half of one of its branches showed signs of withering.<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty of the Bitter Water was not in the comprehension but in enduring the inner torment and stabilizing one’s heart, calming all negative emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo in surprise. “I also feel like you’ve changed.”<br/>
<br/>
“How does the Bitter Water taste?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was about to answer when Sun Lingtong stopped him with a hand gesture. “No need to say anything. I’ll taste it myself! Hehe!”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m really looking forward to this.” Sun Lingtong rubbed his hands together, eyes narrowing in anticipation.<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll guard you.” Ning Zhuo stood up and offered his place to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
After drinking the Bitter Water, Sun Lingtong’s expression also twisted in pain.<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, hang in there!” Ning Zhuo silently cheered him on.<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, Sun Lingtong quickly regained his composure.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, he opened his eyes, looking disappointed. “Little brother, Hanzhou tricked you! These techniques are all based on the Suffering Body.”<br/>
<br/>
“Frost Fist, Cold Leg—they all require cold energy to radiate from within. First, you hurt yourself, then you use it against the enemy.”<br/>
<br/>
“The more you suffer, the stronger you become. But neither of us has cold energy. Unless we cultivate the Bitter Cold Sutra, we won’t be able to manifest such power.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. “Exactly. The power I cultivate through my Five Elements Qi Law is of the Five Elements. It’s impossible for me to infuse that power into my body’s joints without damaging myself, which isn’t worth it.”<br/>
<br/>
“But Boss, don’t forget, I practice three techniques simultaneously. My Five Elements power only resides in my Qi Sea. In my Essence Sea, I have the blood power from the Demon-Dyed Blood Meridian Art.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong smacked his forehead. “Haha, I forgot! You’ve been using the Five Elements power so much lately.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled.<br/>
<br/>
He had already grasped the essence of the Bitter Cold Sutra’s techniques and had crafted techniques that fit with his Demon-Dyed Blood Meridian Art. He just needed to secretly practice them, waiting to surprise his opponents in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Later, Ning Zhuo met with Hanzhou at the agreed location on the Small Peak Martial Arena.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as they met, Han Zhou asked if Ning Zhuo had drunk the Bitter Water.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo replied that he had and had gained insights from it. He asked Han Zhou to spar with him today.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou was surprised and agreed to spar.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo didn’t display any of the techniques, his responses to Han Zhou’s Frost Fist, Cold Leg, and Suffering Body were far more adept, making him much more composed in battle than before.<br/>
<br/>
After the sparring session, Han Zhou remarked with astonishment, “Friend Ning Zhuo, you’ve fully grasped my techniques. Drinking the Bitter Water has greatly benefited you!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled. “I have to thank you for your generosity in giving me such a valuable gift.”<br/>
<br/>
Hanzhou examined Ning Zhuo closely, noting his glowing spirit and radiant energy. “It seems you not only have exceptional comprehension but also an incredibly strong will.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo modestly deflected the praise and pulled out two scrolls.<br/>
<br/>
“These are the Frost Domain Scroll and Snow Domain Scroll. They are two ice techniques from my Ning family, which I offer to you for your enlightenment.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ve gained a good understanding of the Bitter Cold Sutra. Using cold energy to cast ice techniques would be quite effective.”<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou paused, then slowly reached out to accept the scrolls.<br/>
