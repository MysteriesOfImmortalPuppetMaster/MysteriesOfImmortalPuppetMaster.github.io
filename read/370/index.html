<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo shook his head. “Not a good idea. Too many people already know I have these needs. If these precious materials are stolen, I’ll be the first suspect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Sun Lingtong shrugged. “Then I’ll just wipe out their entire stock. Problem solved.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo let out a deep sigh. “Stealing under the noses of Nascent Soul cultivators is far too risky.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“But if we have no other choice, it may come to that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Forget it, let’s not talk about this now. Boss, please guard me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sun Lingtong nodded eagerly. “Little Zhuo, go ahead and comprehend. I’ll watch over you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo took a few steps forward and approached the Spirit Concealment Willow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sensing his presence, the willow swayed its branches, gently brushing against his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo smiled warmly, feeling the tree’s welcome. “Ah, my dear willow, you’ve missed me in these few days, haven’t you? I’ll need your help again this time to assist me in tasting the Bitter Water. Only by growing stronger will I be able to provide you with a better environment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Sun Lingtong giggled. “Brother, you’re funny. What are you chatting with a tree for? Hurry and drink the water.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo turned back and glanced at him. “Boss, ever since I first laid eyes on this tree, I felt a sense of closeness. It’s like I can’t help but talk to it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“Maybe it’s because I’ve practiced the Funeral Prajna Spirit-Resolving Sutra. The more I cultivate, the more I feel that all things have their own spirit. For something like this Spirit Concealment Willow, its wisdom should be even more profound. It can enlighten us, even though it can’t speak or gesture.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“To be honest, every time I talk to it, my heart becomes calm and tranquil.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sun Lingtong shrugged again. “Well, it’s a good way for you to adjust your state for comprehension.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo stopped speaking and took out a meditation mat, sitting cross-legged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He also took out a small jade bottle containing a little bit of Bitter Water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">After calming his breath and adjusting his mind, his heart became as still as a calm lake. His thoughts were clear and undisturbed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He uncorked the bottle and slowly poured the Bitter Water into his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The moment it touched his tongue, the bitterness was beyond words!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This bitterness was not just a matter of taste; it struck deep into his soul. His throat burned, and it felt as though his very spirit was howling in agony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">As the water slid down his throat, it seemed to transform into a frigid stream, swiftly spreading throughout his body. A chill like none he had ever felt before surged from his stomach, radiating to his limbs, bringing with it an unbearable coldness and shivering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">His heartbeat accelerated, cold sweat dripped from his forehead, and his body began to tremble involuntarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">In his mind, scenes of his past sins and wrongdoings began to surface—those he had hurt or owed a debt to, mistakes he had made. The images were vivid and unavoidable, forcing him to confront each one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The faces of the three Huang family ghosts, Ning Zhanji, Ning Ji, Ning Ze, Ning Xiaohui, Zhu Xuanji, Meng Chong, the Black Wind Tiger Demon, Deputy Fox God of Mount Shan, Lin Shanshan... All these memories resurfaced with painful clarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The voices of those he had ignored, the regret and guilt buried deep in his heart, began to whisper and weep around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">An invisible pressure weighed down on him, as if countless hands were tugging at his soul, trying to drag him into the abyss of his sins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Sun Lingtong noticed Ning Zhuo’s pained expression, his face twisted in agony, tears streaming from his tightly shut eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Worried, Sun Lingtong clenched his fists, silently calling out, “Little Zhuo!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He was extremely anxious, but could only watch helplessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Suddenly, he heard Ning Zhuo let out a cold snort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Under the Spirit Concealment Willow, the young man in white had a face as cold as ice. The earlier pain and torment seemed to be frozen over, no longer visible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, filled with a fierce determination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">He sneered inwardly. “All things in heaven and earth are in competition. The path of cultivation seems vast, with countless techniques, but there’s only one true path: the path of victory!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Whether it’s the righteous, demonic, or devil’s path, strength is the only law. Only when I’m strong enough will people deal with me kindly and speak of rules and reason.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“If I had been strong enough, I could have saved my mother at Fire Persimmon Mountain. Why would I need to run around like this?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Only by becoming stronger can I secure the future. A mere Bitter Water cannot shake my will!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“To succeed, I must keep pushing forward, never wavering.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">People react differently to hardship. Some draw strength from adversity, growing ever stronger, their will unshakable, believing every difficulty is just a temporary trial. They press on, knowing that with determination, even the greatest challenge is merely another test of life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Although Ning Zhuo was only sixteen, his life had been filled with harshness. He was often neglected and mistreated. He had to hide his true self constantly, endure separation from his mother, and undergo trials under Sun Lingtong’s teachings. He also had to rack his brain to figure out how to deal with enemies far stronger than himself, like those at the Golden Core or Nascent Soul stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Yet, he was merely in the Qi Refining stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Bitter Cold Sutra was all about drawing strength from suffering, using it to strengthen oneself, ultimately achieving self-liberation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Wasn’t Ning Zhuo’s entire sixteen years a journey of self-liberation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Han Zhou was right—Ning Zhuo truly resonated with the essence of the Bitter Cold Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His Buddha Heart Demon Seal was only a shallow defense. His true nature was always this unyielding!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">No matter how poor or weak I am, no matter how powerful the enemies, they cannot crush my will. I’ll only treat all of this as sharpening stones, as the swamp that hides a dragon preparing to soar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“The finest swords are forged in the harshest of conditions, and the plum blossoms emit their fragrance only after enduring the bitter cold.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This bitterness, after careful reflection, even seemed to have a hint of sweetness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Not only did Ning Zhuo stabilize his emotions, but he also used this as an opportunity to further temper his will.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The truth behind the Bitter Water flowed through him like a great river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He quickly grasped the essence of techniques like Frost Fist, Cold Leg, Suffering Body, Bitter Force, and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Once he understood the essence, it was natural for him to incorporate these techniques into his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">After Ning Zhuo completed his comprehension and stood up, Sun Lingtong immediately approached to check on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo’s eyes sparkled, his mind having undergone a transformation, and his whole being felt renewed. “Boss, I’m feeling fantastic.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He glanced back at the Spirit Concealment Willow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Only half of one of its branches showed signs of withering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The difficulty of the Bitter Water was not in the comprehension but in enduring the inner torment and stabilizing one’s heart, calming all negative emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo in surprise. “I also feel like you’ve changed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“How does the Bitter Water taste?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo was about to answer when Sun Lingtong stopped him with a hand gesture. “No need to say anything. I’ll taste it myself! Hehe!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“I’m really looking forward to this.” Sun Lingtong rubbed his hands together, eyes narrowing in anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“I’ll guard you.” Ning Zhuo stood up and offered his place to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After drinking the Bitter Water, Sun Lingtong’s expression also twisted in pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Boss, hang in there!” Ning Zhuo silently cheered him on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sure enough, Sun Lingtong quickly regained his composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">After a while, he opened his eyes, looking disappointed. “Little brother, Hanzhou tricked you! These techniques are all based on the Suffering Body.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Frost Fist, Cold Leg—they all require cold energy to radiate from within. First, you hurt yourself, then you use it against the enemy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“The more you suffer, the stronger you become. But neither of us has cold energy. Unless we cultivate the Bitter Cold Sutra, we won’t be able to manifest such power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo nodded. “Exactly. The power I cultivate through my Five Elements Qi Law is of the Five Elements. It’s impossible for me to infuse that power into my body’s joints without damaging myself, which isn’t worth it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“But Boss, don’t forget, I practice three techniques simultaneously. My Five Elements power only resides in my Qi Sea. In my Essence Sea, I have the blood power from the Demon-Dyed Blood Meridian Art.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sun Lingtong smacked his forehead. “Haha, I forgot! You’ve been using the Five Elements power so much lately.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He had already grasped the essence of the Bitter Cold Sutra’s techniques and had crafted techniques that fit with his Demon-Dyed Blood Meridian Art. He just needed to secretly practice them, waiting to surprise his opponents in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Later, Ning Zhuo met with Hanzhou at the agreed location on the Small Peak Martial Arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">As soon as they met, Han Zhou asked if Ning Zhuo had drunk the Bitter Water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo replied that he had and had gained insights from it. He asked Han Zhou to spar with him today.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Han Zhou was surprised and agreed to spar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Although Ning Zhuo didn’t display any of the techniques, his responses to Han Zhou’s Frost Fist, Cold Leg, and Suffering Body were far more adept, making him much more composed in battle than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">After the sparring session, Han Zhou remarked with astonishment, “Friend Ning Zhuo, you’ve fully grasped my techniques. Drinking the Bitter Water has greatly benefited you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo smiled. “I have to thank you for your generosity in giving me such a valuable gift.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Hanzhou examined Ning Zhuo closely, noting his glowing spirit and radiant energy. “It seems you not only have exceptional comprehension but also an incredibly strong will.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo modestly deflected the praise and pulled out two scrolls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“These are the Frost Domain Scroll and Snow Domain Scroll. They are two ice techniques from my Ning family, which I offer to you for your enlightenment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“I’ve gained a good understanding of the Bitter Cold Sutra. Using cold energy to cast ice techniques would be quite effective.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Han Zhou paused, then slowly reached out to accept the scrolls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
