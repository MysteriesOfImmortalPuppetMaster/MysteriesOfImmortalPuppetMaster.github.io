<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo's expression was solemn. After discussing with the two others, he decided to agree to the ransom once more, allowing Ning Xiangguo to make another trip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo comforted his uncle and aunt, then immediately went to pay respects to the Ning family Ancestor, Ning Jiufan, and explain the situation to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Jiufan asked Ning Zhuo, "What do you think?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo replied, "I believe this is due to my participation in the palace examination and my rather good performance. Clearly, many people do not wish to see me continue to succeed. Therefore, they resorted to underhanded tactics to distract me and waste my time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Jiufan stroked his beard, looking at Ning Zhuo with a hint of appreciation in his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">In his view, Ning Zhuo's performance was more than just "good"; it was outstanding beyond imagination. He had managed to win against many Golden Core stage cultivators, achieving more victories than defeats. This made him stand out among the Qi Refining Stage cultivators, even surpassing Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"It's quite normal for you to be targeted. It's good that you can see the essence of it," Ning Jiufan said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"So, relying on ransom to get your cousin back is hopeless. What do you plan to do?" Ning Jiufan continued to test Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo sighed, looking at Ning Jiufan with a face full of worry. "Ancestor, to be honest, I'm not close to my uncle's family. For a long time, I was living under their roof and they often treated me coldly and indifferently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"But firstly, they are my closest blood relatives in this world. Secondly, I did grow up under their protection to some extent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Emotionally and rationally, I can't just ignore them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"When poor, one should cultivate oneself; when successful, one should help the world. Therefore, as soon as I achieved something, I thought of repaying them, returning this kindness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"In this situation, even though I know it's the enemy's plot, I can only fall into their trap."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After hearing this, Ning Jiufan couldn't help but stroke his beard again and sighed, "Ah, you child..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He stopped speaking, but in his heart, he was very satisfied with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo usually seemed unreliable, always talking about splitting the family, but he was, after all, a member of the Ning family and deeply attached to family ties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Jiufan had long reviewed Ning Zhuo's information and knew well that Ning Ze's family treated Ning Zhuo not just with indifference and coldness but as a burden. This was evident from the fact that "Ning Zhuo lost his mother at two years old, yet it took several years before Ning Ze's family adopted him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Even so, Ning Zhuo still treated Ning Ze's family with much generosity. At the critical moment of the palace examination, he was unwilling to abandon Ning Ji and willing to fall into the trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">This attitude of "falling into the trap" moved Ning Jiufan greatly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"To truly know a person, you must not only listen to what they say but also watch what they do."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"This child, Ning Zhuo, is good; inherently kind and gentle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"A good seedling indeed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"With such magnanimity and vision, if he becomes the Clan Leader in the future, it might be a good thing for the entire family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Jiufan had long accumulated disappointment and dissatisfaction with the current main branch of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo had mentioned splitting the family in front of him a number of times and the quantity of these mentions began to make Ning Jiufan seriously consider the possibility of Ning Zhuo leading the family in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Jiufan said, "You don't need to worry about this matter. I'll handle it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo became nervous, "Ancestor, are you planning to take action yourself? That won't do!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"You are our Ning family's greatest hope."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"The upcoming palace examination can do without me, but it absolutely cannot do without you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"The reason I performed well is merely because I took advantage of the examination rules."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"I'd rather have my energy and time diverted, but you must not. If you do, the enemy might laugh themselves awake in their sleep!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Seeing Ning Zhuo's concern for him, Ning Jiufan was greatly comforted and couldn't help but reach out to pat Ning Zhuo's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This affectionate gesture was the first time Ning Jiufan had done such a thing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">And he had to admit, this big head felt quite nice to touch!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Don't worry, little Zhuo. I have my own discretion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Don't underestimate yourself. The second stage of the palace examination showed everyone that the Lava Immortal Palace's examination is very favorable to trial disciples."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"You've switched to cultivating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, making you one of the Lava Immortal Palace's own. In the upcoming examinations, this identity advantage cannot be ignored."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"From now on, only the two of us from the Ning family will participate in the examination. We must advance together. Even if we can't obtain the position of palace master, we can still seek other high-ranking positions and lay a solid foundation for the Ning family in the future Fire Persimmon Immortal City!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"I'll handle this small storm for you. From now on, you must give it your all and not be distracted by external trivialities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo was moved to tears and immediately bowed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo was not surprised to receive Ning Jiufan's protection. The latter's actions were one of the scenarios he had anticipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">After taking his leave, he immediately called Ning Xiangguo and informed him that he would be under the Ancestor's protection. He would now focus entirely on the examination and would no longer concern himself with external matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Xiangguo immediately showed a hint of joy, congratulating Ning Zhuo on being recognized and protected by their Ancestor, foreseeing a bright future ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He strongly agreed with Ning Jiufan's view that this was undoubtedly the enemy's plot to distract Ning Zhuo. If Ning Zhuo were affected, it would affect the entire Ning family, and they could not let the enemy succeed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Despite Ning Xiangguo's eloquent words, Ning Zhuo clearly understood the latter's role as an internal traitor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Xiangguo had secretly pledged allegiance to the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">And according to the subsequent intelligence from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Ning Zhuo also knew that the masked individuals were indeed the City Lord's Mansion's hidden hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The masked assassins were skilled in using Gu insects and had previously targeted and plotted against the geniuses of the three families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Xiangguo himself was unaware of the true allegiance of the masked individuals. However, this did not prevent him from regularly passing his information to that dark line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The dark line of the City Lord's Mansion received this information and immediately presented it to the higher-ups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Upon seeing it, the higher-ups became anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">They had finally found a way to interfere with Ning Zhuo, only to have it thwarted by Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This immediately stirred strong malice in the higher-ups, who wanted to quickly extract all value from Ning Ji while he was still useful, the intention being to cause a significant mental blow to Ning Zhuo with Ning Ji's death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Although Ning Zhuo is a genius, he is still just a sixteen-year-old child."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Even if his relationship with his uncle's family is thin, as long as Ning Ji dies, I will have other means to spread rumors and tarnish Ning Zhuo's righteous reputation to make him frustrated and irritable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The higher-ups quickly reported their opinions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The action plan eventually reached Fei Si's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Ning Zhuo..." Fei Si sighed, recalling Ning Zhuo's respectful demeanor when he greeted him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">But Fei Si could sense the fire burning in Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"You brat, in the end, you're still blocking the path of my Meng family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">No matter how much Fei Si appreciated Ning Zhuo, he couldn't sacrifice his own interests for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Fei Si was dependent on Meng Kui, and any damage to the Meng family's interests was a damage to his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Thus, he used his malicious and cunning intelligence to refine the entire action plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The higher-ups, upon receiving Fei Si's instructions, found them increasingly ingenious, praising "As expected of Lord Fei Si" while fully executing the plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Soon, the masked individuals received orders to act and appeared before Ning Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"You are going to die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Ning Zhuo will not save you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Before you die, do you have anything to say?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Ji was shocked, crying out in disbelief and begging bitterly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The masked individuals tortured him severely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Ji, tormented to the point of wishing for death, cursed at the masked individuals and Ning Zhuo, venting his rage and regret before dying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Jiufan issued orders, commanding a group of skilled family members to raid the kidnappers' location, attempting to rescue Ning Ji by force while leaving no room for the enemy's schemes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Xiangguo also received secret orders from the City Lord's Mansion. Through the operation of other dark lines, he led a group of trusted followers and successfully infiltrated the rescue team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Ji was dead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The rescue mission failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But Ning Xiangguo succeeded!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He intercepted Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, who was attempting to escape, capturing her. He delivered both her and the evidence of her kidnapping Ning Ji to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Seeing the evidence, Ning Zhuo's face was as calm as water in front of Ning Xiangguo, crushing the cup in his hand in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">When alone, his gaze was deep, and his heart felt cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He felt the chill — the coldness from those in power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Jiufan didn't care about Ning Ji's safety; he cared about the Ning family's interests. Therefore, after understanding Ning Zhuo's "true feelings," he acted without hesitation. Regardless of success or failure, he wanted to end this matter decisively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Fei Si, besides being cold, was even more ruthless. He decisively activated Ning Xiangguo as a pawn, delivering Ning Xiaohui's grandmother to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Because he knew: Ning Zhuo had a deep aversion to the main branch of the Ning family. Now, knowing that Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was the culprit behind his cousin Ning Ji's kidnapping, what would Ning Zhuo do?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo would most likely cause a commotion! He would be angry, agitated, and unstable, and his environment would also become unstable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo would become a bomb within the Ning family faction!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Fei Si's malice was evident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">And he had only sent out an insane old woman while keeping Ning Xiaoren as a backup. Using schemes without exhausting them, he was indeed a master strategist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">As for Ning Ji?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Heh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Who truly cared about the life and death of such a small figure?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Perhaps only his biological parents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"The life of a small figure is truly fragile."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">In the dim light of the room, Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Ji's life took a sharp turn — one moment in the limelight with people flattering him, and the next moment a hostage, tortured to death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">All because he was caught in the power struggle of the higher-ups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">He was like a fragment, crushed to dust between the grinding stones of two forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo thought of himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He was well aware that his favor with Ning Jiufan was largely due to the value he demonstrated, especially after Ning Xiaohui's death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Compared to Ning Jiufan and Fei Si, he was a small figure. Compared to the Meng family and the Zhu family of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, he was also a small figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">A slight misstep and he too would be mercilessly crushed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Just like Ning Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The only difference might be that Ning Ji never knew the truth until his death, while Ning Zhuo might understand a bit more, dying with clarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This situation for Ning Zhuo was actually better than his plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He quickly took action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Ning family cultivators arranged in the Lava Immortal Palace represented various branches of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo first secretly negotiated with them, reaching a consensus before contacting the main branch of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">This sudden situation startled the Ning family Clan Leader, prompting him to use an emergency teleportation route to personally rush to the Lava Immortal Palace for a private meeting with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo's stance was straightforward: Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, a member of the main branch, kidnapped a junior from a side branch, threatening the family's young genius. If this matter were exposed, how devastating would it be for the main branch and for you, the Clan Leader?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">But I, Ning Zhuo, for the sake of the family and the bigger picture, could be willing to not expose this matter. However, if you want to cover it up, there must be a price to pay!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Ning family Clan Leader's face turned ashen, "The price is agreeing to your demand for a family split? Absolutely not!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo smiled, "The other branches of the main family have agreed. What significance does your insistence have?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The Ning family Clan Leader was resolute; having a family split during his tenure would be a major blemish on his administration!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">But Ning Zhuo had already cornered him, "The so-called price is negotiable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Clan Leader, don't you want your son to return to the family?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
