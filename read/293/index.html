<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The trouble at the black market was one of the scenarios Ning Zhuo had long anticipated. He wasn't surprised in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"If it really doesn't work out, just abandon the black market entirely and retreat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Compared to the Lava Immortal Palace, the black market was merely a minor branch. If Ning Zhuo were to be distracted by this, investing even a little effort and time would mean the enemy's schemes had succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Of course, a full retreat was only a last resort. At this stage, it wasn't necessary yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo immediately sent a reply, instructing the black market to seek help from Ning Youfu and Ning Houjun, the two former family elders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo had long-term strategies and had anticipated many difficulties he would face during the palace examination. He had made arrangements in advance, one of which was persuading Ning Youfu and Ning Houjun, the two former family elders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">These two played a significant role in Ning Zhuo's efforts to topple Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Being from a branch of the family themselves, they were optimistic about Ning Zhuo and willing to support him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Only these types of heavyweight figures could stabilize the situation, giving the leaderless black market authoritative leadership, thereby preventing panic and confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In the letter, he also requested the black market to allocate a group of personnel to enter the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">This group, led by Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian, would include a large number of Ning family cultivators and forcibly recruited members from the monkey head gang, Turtle Breath Gang, and Crane Beak Gang, totaling over a hundred people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"This so-called power is for my use, not for me to invest too much into it." Ning Zhuo understood this point deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The power he had painstakingly built — if not used now, then when?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The second stage of the palace examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The eleventh round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong's complete victory made others grit their teeth in anger, yet they could do nothing about it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo had more victories than defeats. Although he tried to keep a low profile, it was no longer possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Whether on the stage or in the plaza, the cultivators' views of him had changed. Even Golden Core stage cultivators treated him as a formidable opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Unexpectedly, a mere Qi Refining stage junior has emerged."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Ning Zhuo indeed has some skills."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Every time Ning Zhuo faces Zhu Xuanji or Ning Jiufan, he voluntarily concedes. If he really fought, his record might be even higher!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Many praised him openly while secretly exchanging glances, realizing they couldn't let Ning Zhuo continue winning like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">However, Ning Zhuo was extremely cautious; he stayed holed up in his residence all day. Ning Jiufan, the Ning Clan ancestor, lived next door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This left many feeling powerless and sighing helplessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">In the deep night of the Lava Immortal Palace, the firelight surged, as bright as day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Since the volcanic eruption and the beast tide surged, the sky above the Lava Immortal Palace had been shrouded in heavy smoke, obscuring the sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Xiaoren had been fighting here for some time, gradually losing track of whether it was day or night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He had been fighting continuously for over ten hours. His face was haggard, his eyes bloodshot, and the continuous high-intensity battles made him wish he could collapse and sleep immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">But he couldn't, forcing himself to endure the fatigue and exhaustion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"They're here, a group of demon beasts in the southeast corner," a cultivator suddenly shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">A few breaths later, the cultivator responsible for scouting spoke again, "Be careful, this group of demon beasts is all Flame Lizards. We must strike first and prevent them from reaching our formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Xiaoren and others formed a team of cultivators, stationed at a street corner. They had set up a formation and were defending from a strategic position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Most were cultivators from the main branch of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Although Ning Xiaoren had been expelled from the family, cooperating at this time didn't violate any family rules.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Hearing the warning, Ning Xiaoren gritted his teeth and urged his nearly exhausted mana to maneuver the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Casting spells through the formation was much faster than individually, and with greater power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Giant ice spears like massive trees formed instantly and shot out in succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The ice spears killed several Flame Lizards while enraging the remaining ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Flame Lizards roared, charging towards Ning Xiaoren's position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Within, cultivators immediately controlled the formation, deploying a large number of mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">These constructs, primarily battering rams, charged forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Although they were shattered by the Flame Lizards, they successfully halted their charge, significantly reducing their speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Xiaoren panted heavily, feeling waves of nausea. His mana was exhausted, forcing him to temporarily retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Backup cultivators immediately replaced him, taking over the formation's core and controlling it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After a fierce spell bombardment, one Flame Lizard still managed to get close.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Damn, we haven't gotten the physical cultivators yet!" The cultivators' faces turned pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">At this moment, a frenzied voice rang out, "Afraid! Who scared my little Hui? Watch your grandma, little Hui, don't be afraid!" With that, Ning Xiaohui's grandmother rushed out of the formation, charging straight at the Flame Lizard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">She collided with the Flame Lizard, only to be thrown back, crashing through two buildings before falling to the ground, unable to get up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">She was almost entirely broken. Her protective artifact was shattered and she was continuously coughing up blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"This lunatic!" Ning Xiaoren's pupils contracted upon witnessing this scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Ning family main branch cultivators also had varied expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Thanks to Ning Xiaohui's grandmother's desperate obstruction, they were able to seize the opportunity, unleashing a round of spells to annihilate the last Flame Lizard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The formation was stabilized, but Ning Xiaoren's heart was heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"The demon beasts have thick hides. This was just a group of Foundation Establishment level Scarlet Flame Beasts. If it were Golden Core level, could I retreat safely?" Ning Xiaoren had no confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He looked at Ning Xiaohui's grandmother. At this point, Ning family cultivators had already rushed out of the formation to her side, beginning treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"She's already gone mad."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Ning Xiaohui's death hit her too hard."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"How am I living with such a madwoman in the same formation?" Ning Xiaoren felt a chill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"It's all Ning Zhuo's fault, that little bastard!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be a prisoner. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be risking my life here to earn merits under the guise of being expelled from the family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Ning Zhuo deserves to die, he deserves to die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"The heavens are blind, allowing this treacherous villain to thrive. Even in the second stage of the palace examination, he's among the top! What are those Golden Core cultivators and geniuses doing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Can't they even deal with Ning Zhuo?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Xiaoren's situation was just a microcosm of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The destruction of the Lava Immortal Palace had both advantages and disadvantages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The advantage was that Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators, even without any mechanical expertise, could enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Under the leadership of Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji, Fire Persimmon Immortal City dispatched a large number of Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators to the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">These cultivators, like a timely rain, filled all the front lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">With their participation, the defense lines within the Lava Immortal Palace were reinforced, firmly blocking the advance of the beast tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">After all, among the Scarlet Flame Beasts, there weren't many Golden Core level individuals. Once they appeared, they were focused on and rarely survived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">As for the real threat to the Lava Immortal Palace, the two Nascent Soul level demon beasts were being held off and entangled by Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">However, Meng Kui, fighting one against two, often fell into a disadvantage in this battle situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Nascent Soul level demon beasts frequently achieved victories, shattering the outer areas of the Lava Immortal Palace piece by piece.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The more that the Lava Immortal Palace was broken and lost, the weaker the restrictions became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Currently, Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators could find gaps and directly enter the Immortal Palace. Following this trend, Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators would soon be able to enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Ning Xiaoren, you're too tired. Go back and rest. Once you're in good condition, come back to fight!" The Ning family main branch cultivators still showed considerable care for Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Xiaoren nodded and eagerly retreated from the front line after recovering a bit of mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">On his way back, he saw a large group of people gathered together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Curious, he approached to inquire and discovered it was a murder scene. A Foundation Establishment cultivator had been ambushed and killed, with his heart pierced and his soul missing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"The Void Sect has struck again! The deceased had just participated in the palace examination during the day and lost his life at night, sigh..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"These evil ones will stop at nothing to gain the Lava Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Upon learning the details, Ning Xiaoren gritted his teeth, "Why not assassinate Ning Zhuo? Good people don't live long, while the wicked live for a thousand years. What a rotten world!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">This was already the third recent murder targeting palace examination members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Two were successfully killed and one was severely injured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Strictly speaking, severe injury was also a success. The injured cultivator was in such poor condition that they lost every match in the arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Palace examination participants couldn't attack each other directly, but they could certainly use others to carry out schemes and suppressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The competition for the Lava Immortal Palace wasn't just about the daytime palace examination but also the nighttime assassinations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">It was foreseeable that lone cultivators without deep backgrounds or backing would be gradually eliminated and lose their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Xiaoren returned to his residence and fell asleep immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The next moment, he was startled awake by the cold touch of a dagger pressed against his neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Who are you?!" Ning Xiaoren was shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The masked assassin held the dagger, constantly threatening Ning Xiaoren's life, "Tell me about Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"You, you want to deal with him?" Ning Xiaoren realized, his expression stunned, "No, I won't betray my clansman."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The intruder sneered, "Don't pretend. Who doesn't know about your grudge with him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Besides, you've already been expelled from the family, all thanks to Ning Zhuo! He's no longer your clansman, former young master of the Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Xiaoren's face quickly darkened, a trace of venom flashing in his eyes, "What do you want to know?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Everything," the masked person said calmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Xiaoren: "How do I know you'll let me go if I tell you everything?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The masked person shook his head, "You don't know, and I can't guarantee it. You just need to know that you must satisfy me. If I'm not satisfied, I'll cut off your head."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Xiaoren hurriedly said, "Okay, okay, I'll talk, I'll talk." He spoke in great detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The masked assassin was dissatisfied, "I already know all this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He pried open Ning Xiaoren's mouth with the dagger's tip, sending a Gu insect into his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Gu insect burrowed its way down, entering Ning Xiaoren's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The masked assassin gently activated it, and Ning Xiaoren immediately clutched his chest, writhing and convulsing on the bed like an electrified maggot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The masked assassin tortured him for a while before stopping, "Your answers are very unsatisfactory."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"I'm giving you a task now: do everything you can to obstruct Ning Zhuo and interfere with him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Otherwise, I'll let you die a miserable death from this heart-eating pain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Xiaoren quickly waved his hands, desperately pleading, "Sir, please don't be impulsive. I'll do it, I'll definitely do it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Ning Zhuo is my enemy, after all. We're on the same side, we're allies!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The masked assassin sneered, "It's good that you have this awareness. You have three days to show results, or you'll die." With that, the masked assassin disappeared from Ning Xiaoren's sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Coming and going without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Leaving Ning Xiaoren biting his lip, banging his head against the bed, "Ning Zhuo! Ning Zhuo!! I almost died because of you, you damned thing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"I'll kill you, I'll kill you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">However, after venting for a while, Ning Xiaoren gradually regained his composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Ning Zhuo, that little bastard, has done so many wicked things. Since the palace examination began, he's been hiding, living next to Ning Jiufan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Under the protection of a Golden Core cultivator, how can I kill him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"That dog thief, too cunning, too cunning!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
