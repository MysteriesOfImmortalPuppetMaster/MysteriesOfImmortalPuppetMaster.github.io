<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The trouble at the black market was one of the scenarios Ning Zhuo had long anticipated. He wasn't surprised in the slightest.<br/>
<br/>
"If it really doesn't work out, just abandon the black market entirely and retreat."<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the Lava Immortal Palace, the black market was merely a minor branch. If Ning Zhuo were to be distracted by this, investing even a little effort and time would mean the enemy's schemes had succeeded.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, a full retreat was only a last resort. At this stage, it wasn't necessary yet.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately sent a reply, instructing the black market to seek help from Ning Youfu and Ning Houjun, the two former family elders.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had long-term strategies and had anticipated many difficulties he would face during the palace examination. He had made arrangements in advance, one of which was persuading Ning Youfu and Ning Houjun, the two former family elders.<br/>
<br/>
These two played a significant role in Ning Zhuo's efforts to topple Ning Xiaoren.<br/>
<br/>
Being from a branch of the family themselves, they were optimistic about Ning Zhuo and willing to support him.<br/>
<br/>
Only these types of heavyweight figures could stabilize the situation, giving the leaderless black market authoritative leadership, thereby preventing panic and confusion.<br/>
<br/>
In the letter, he also requested the black market to allocate a group of personnel to enter the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
This group, led by Ning Xiangguo and Ning Xiangqian, would include a large number of Ning family cultivators and forcibly recruited members from the monkey head gang, Turtle Breath Gang, and Crane Beak Gang, totaling over a hundred people.<br/>
<br/>
"This so-called power is for my use, not for me to invest too much into it." Ning Zhuo understood this point deeply.<br/>
<br/>
The power he had painstakingly built ‚Äî if not used now, then when?<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
The second stage of the palace examination.<br/>
<br/>
The eleventh round.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's complete victory made others grit their teeth in anger, yet they could do nothing about it.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had more victories than defeats. Although he tried to keep a low profile, it was no longer possible.<br/>
<br/>
Whether on the stage or in the plaza, the cultivators' views of him had changed. Even Golden Core stage cultivators treated him as a formidable opponent.<br/>
<br/>
"Unexpectedly, a mere Qi Refining stage junior has emerged."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo indeed has some skills."<br/>
<br/>
"Every time Ning Zhuo faces Zhu Xuanji or Ning Jiufan, he voluntarily concedes. If he really fought, his record might be even higher!"<br/>
<br/>
Many praised him openly while secretly exchanging glances, realizing they couldn't let Ning Zhuo continue winning like this.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zhuo was extremely cautious; he stayed holed up in his residence all day. Ning Jiufan, the Ning Clan ancestor, lived next door.<br/>
<br/>
This left many feeling powerless and sighing helplessly.<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
In the deep night of the Lava Immortal Palace, the firelight surged, as bright as day.<br/>
<br/>
Since the volcanic eruption and the beast tide surged, the sky above the Lava Immortal Palace had been shrouded in heavy smoke, obscuring the sun.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren had been fighting here for some time, gradually losing track of whether it was day or night.<br/>
<br/>
He had been fighting continuously for over ten hours. His face was haggard, his eyes bloodshot, and the continuous high-intensity battles made him wish he could collapse and sleep immediately.<br/>
<br/>
But he couldn't, forcing himself to endure the fatigue and exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
"They're here, a group of demon beasts in the southeast corner," a cultivator suddenly shouted.<br/>
<br/>
A few breaths later, the cultivator responsible for scouting spoke again, "Be careful, this group of demon beasts is all Flame Lizards. We must strike first and prevent them from reaching our formation."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren and others formed a team of cultivators, stationed at a street corner. They had set up a formation and were defending from a strategic position.<br/>
<br/>
Most were cultivators from the main branch of the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Xiaoren had been expelled from the family, cooperating at this time didn't violate any family rules.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing the warning, Ning Xiaoren gritted his teeth and urged his nearly exhausted mana to maneuver the formation.<br/>
<br/>
Casting spells through the formation was much faster than individually, and with greater power.<br/>
<br/>
Giant ice spears like massive trees formed instantly and shot out in succession.<br/>
<br/>
The ice spears killed several Flame Lizards while enraging the remaining ones.<br/>
<br/>
The Flame Lizards roared, charging towards Ning Xiaoren's position.<br/>
<br/>
Within, cultivators immediately controlled the formation, deploying a large number of mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
These constructs, primarily battering rams, charged forward.<br/>
<br/>
Although they were shattered by the Flame Lizards, they successfully halted their charge, significantly reducing their speed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren panted heavily, feeling waves of nausea. His mana was exhausted, forcing him to temporarily retreat.<br/>
<br/>
Backup cultivators immediately replaced him, taking over the formation's core and controlling it.<br/>
<br/>
After a fierce spell bombardment, one Flame Lizard still managed to get close.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn, we haven't gotten the physical cultivators yet!" The cultivators' faces turned pale.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, a frenzied voice rang out, "Afraid! Who scared my little Hui? Watch your grandma, little Hui, don't be afraid!" With that, Ning Xiaohui's grandmother rushed out of the formation, charging straight at the Flame Lizard.<br/>
<br/>
She collided with the Flame Lizard, only to be thrown back, crashing through two buildings before falling to the ground, unable to get up.<br/>
<br/>
She was almost entirely broken. Her protective artifact was shattered and she was continuously coughing up blood.<br/>
<br/>
"This lunatic!" Ning Xiaoren's pupils contracted upon witnessing this scene.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family main branch cultivators also had varied expressions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Ning Xiaohui's grandmother's desperate obstruction, they were able to seize the opportunity, unleashing a round of spells to annihilate the last Flame Lizard.<br/>
<br/>
The formation was stabilized, but Ning Xiaoren's heart was heavy.<br/>
<br/>
"The demon beasts have thick hides. This was just a group of Foundation Establishment level Scarlet Flame Beasts. If it were Golden Core level, could I retreat safely?" Ning Xiaoren had no confidence.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at Ning Xiaohui's grandmother. At this point, Ning family cultivators had already rushed out of the formation to her side, beginning treatment.<br/>
<br/>
"She's already gone mad."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui's death hit her too hard."<br/>
<br/>
"How am I living with such a madwoman in the same formation?" Ning Xiaoren felt a chill.<br/>
<br/>
"It's all Ning Zhuo's fault, that little bastard!"<br/>
<br/>
"If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be a prisoner. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be risking my life here to earn merits under the guise of being expelled from the family."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo deserves to die, he deserves to die!"<br/>
<br/>
"The heavens are blind, allowing this treacherous villain to thrive. Even in the second stage of the palace examination, he's among the top! What are those Golden Core cultivators and geniuses doing?"<br/>
<br/>
"Can't they even deal with Ning Zhuo?!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren's situation was just a microcosm of the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The destruction of the Lava Immortal Palace had both advantages and disadvantages.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage was that Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators, even without any mechanical expertise, could enter.<br/>
<br/>
Under the leadership of Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji, Fire Persimmon Immortal City dispatched a large number of Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators to the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
These cultivators, like a timely rain, filled all the front lines.<br/>
<br/>
With their participation, the defense lines within the Lava Immortal Palace were reinforced, firmly blocking the advance of the beast tide.<br/>
<br/>
After all, among the Scarlet Flame Beasts, there weren't many Golden Core level individuals. Once they appeared, they were focused on and rarely survived.<br/>
<br/>
As for the real threat to the Lava Immortal Palace, the two Nascent Soul level demon beasts were being held off and entangled by Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
However, Meng Kui, fighting one against two, often fell into a disadvantage in this battle situation.<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul level demon beasts frequently achieved victories, shattering the outer areas of the Lava Immortal Palace piece by piece.<br/>
<br/>
The more that the Lava Immortal Palace was broken and lost, the weaker the restrictions became.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators could find gaps and directly enter the Immortal Palace. Following this trend, Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators would soon be able to enter.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaoren, you're too tired. Go back and rest. Once you're in good condition, come back to fight!" The Ning family main branch cultivators still showed considerable care for Ning Xiaoren.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren nodded and eagerly retreated from the front line after recovering a bit of mana.<br/>
<br/>
On his way back, he saw a large group of people gathered together.<br/>
<br/>
Curious, he approached to inquire and discovered it was a murder scene. A Foundation Establishment cultivator had been ambushed and killed, with his heart pierced and his soul missing.<br/>
<br/>
"The Void Sect has struck again! The deceased had just participated in the palace examination during the day and lost his life at night, sigh..."<br/>
<br/>
"These evil ones will stop at nothing to gain the Lava Immortal Palace!"<br/>
<br/>
Upon learning the details, Ning Xiaoren gritted his teeth, "Why not assassinate Ning Zhuo? Good people don't live long, while the wicked live for a thousand years. What a rotten world!"<br/>
<br/>
This was already the third recent murder targeting palace examination members.<br/>
<br/>
Two were successfully killed and one was severely injured.<br/>
<br/>
Strictly speaking, severe injury was also a success. The injured cultivator was in such poor condition that they lost every match in the arena.<br/>
<br/>
Palace examination participants couldn't attack each other directly, but they could certainly use others to carry out schemes and suppressions.<br/>
<br/>
The competition for the Lava Immortal Palace wasn't just about the daytime palace examination but also the nighttime assassinations.<br/>
<br/>
It was foreseeable that lone cultivators without deep backgrounds or backing would be gradually eliminated and lose their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren returned to his residence and fell asleep immediately.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he was startled awake by the cold touch of a dagger pressed against his neck.<br/>
<br/>
"Who are you?!" Ning Xiaoren was shocked.<br/>
<br/>
The masked assassin held the dagger, constantly threatening Ning Xiaoren's life, "Tell me about Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"You, you want to deal with him?" Ning Xiaoren realized, his expression stunned, "No, I won't betray my clansman."<br/>
<br/>
The intruder sneered, "Don't pretend. Who doesn't know about your grudge with him?"<br/>
<br/>
"Besides, you've already been expelled from the family, all thanks to Ning Zhuo! He's no longer your clansman, former young master of the Ning family."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren's face quickly darkened, a trace of venom flashing in his eyes, "What do you want to know?"<br/>
<br/>
"Everything," the masked person said calmly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren: "How do I know you'll let me go if I tell you everything?"<br/>
<br/>
The masked person shook his head, "You don't know, and I can't guarantee it. You just need to know that you must satisfy me. If I'm not satisfied, I'll cut off your head."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren hurriedly said, "Okay, okay, I'll talk, I'll talk." He spoke in great detail.<br/>
<br/>
The masked assassin was dissatisfied, "I already know all this."<br/>
<br/>
He pried open Ning Xiaoren's mouth with the dagger's tip, sending a Gu insect into his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
The Gu insect burrowed its way down, entering Ning Xiaoren's heart.<br/>
<br/>
The masked assassin gently activated it, and Ning Xiaoren immediately clutched his chest, writhing and convulsing on the bed like an electrified maggot.<br/>
<br/>
The masked assassin tortured him for a while before stopping, "Your answers are very unsatisfactory."<br/>
<br/>
"I'm giving you a task now: do everything you can to obstruct Ning Zhuo and interfere with him."<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, I'll let you die a miserable death from this heart-eating pain."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren quickly waved his hands, desperately pleading, "Sir, please don't be impulsive. I'll do it, I'll definitely do it."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo is my enemy, after all. We're on the same side, we're allies!"<br/>
<br/>
The masked assassin sneered, "It's good that you have this awareness. You have three days to show results, or you'll die." With that, the masked assassin disappeared from Ning Xiaoren's sight.<br/>
<br/>
Coming and going without a trace.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Ning Xiaoren biting his lip, banging his head against the bed, "Ning Zhuo! Ning Zhuo!! I almost died because of you, you damned thing!"<br/>
<br/>
"I'll kill you, I'll kill you!"<br/>
<br/>
However, after venting for a while, Ning Xiaoren gradually regained his composure.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, that little bastard, has done so many wicked things. Since the palace examination began, he's been hiding, living next to Ning Jiufan."<br/>
<br/>
"Under the protection of a Golden Core cultivator, how can I kill him?"<br/>
<br/>
"That dog thief, too cunning, too cunning!"<br/>
