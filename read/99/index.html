<paragraph index="1">Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Zhu Xuanji paused before a small house and gently pushed open the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The next moment, dense shadows poured out like a tide, swallowing him up completely. After devouring Zhu Xuanji, the surge of shadows churned, blanketing the entire alley in darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Within the darkness, a pair of golden eyes suddenly lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">They were Zhu Xuanji’s Golden Pupils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Divine light surged within his eyes, piercing through the churning shadows and breaking past all concealment to lock onto a demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This demonic cultivator was in the middle of Foundation Establishment. Although his disguise had been destroyed, he showed no panic. Instead, he laughed coldly and launched himself straight toward Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The two people clashed within the mass of shadows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhu Xuanji only took a light step backward. Meanwhile, the demonic cultivator let out a muffled groan and was sent flying backward through the darkness even faster than he’d arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">However, Zhu Xuanji didn’t press the advantage. Instead, he frowned, as if sensing something off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“As expected of Sir Zhu. You easily saw through my disguise.” The demonic cultivator’s voice echoed out from all directions. “But can you see through what’s next?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">As his voice fell, countless figures that were all identical to the demonic cultivator flew out from the shadows and surrounded Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zhu Xuanji’s magical power surged as he struck down the incoming figures in rapid succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">As these figures were defeated, they broke apart, revealing their true identity as mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">However, the shattered mechanical constructs rapidly reassembled themselves within the shadows and continued their onslaught.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zhu Xuanji stayed where he was, allowing wave after wave of mechanical constructs to attack him. His guard remained solid and unshaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Deep in the shadows, the real demonic cultivator sensed that things were going poorly and prepared to make an escape. But at that moment, Zhu Xuanji spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Liu Ying[^1], don’t you think it’s a bit too late to start thinking of escaping?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The demonic cultivator, Liu Ying, felt a chill crawl down his spine as the Golden Pupils locked onto him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He desperately retreated, but Zhu Xuanji had already located his true body and followed close behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Boom boom boom…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">After several rounds of vicious attacks, Liu Ying fell helplessly to the ground. His chest was crushed, and broken ribs pierced into his lungs. Blood sprayed from his mouth and nostrils with every breath, and each moment was a desperate struggle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Don’t, don’t kill me. I surrender!” Liu Ying saw Zhu Xuanji approaching at a steady pace and immediately begged for his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Zhu Xuanji said, “It seems that you’re just using shadows to replace puppet strings on your mechanical constructs.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Liu Ying was momentarily stunned. “Sir Zhu, could there be some misunderstanding?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhu Xuanji shook his head. “Just taking precautions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Even if there is a misunderstanding, the hundreds who died at your hands wouldn’t think so.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Liu Ying’s pupils contracted sharply. Shadows surged like a swarm of serpents, striking at Zhu Xuanji from behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But once they reached within three chi of his body, the shadows melted away like snow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Liu Ying’s final blow failed. As death approached him, he cried out, “I don’t understand! I’m only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage. Although I’ve entered the Lava Immortal Palace a few times, why are you, Divine Investigator Zhu, targeting me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Zhu Xuanji gave no answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In the next instant, Liu Ying perished by Zhu Xuanji’s hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“The fifth one.” Zhu Xuanji pulled out a list and crossed out Liu Ying’s name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Although this demonic cultivator was skilled in shadow escape techniques, he had nowhere to hide in front of the Golden Pupils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zhu Xuanji’s list wasn’t arranged by cultivation base, but rather by degree of suspicion and overall threat level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Liu Ying’s methods bore many similarities to those of the black shadow demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">More crucially, Zhu Xuanji suspected that Liu Ying might have grasped the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability. Although this possibility was very low, it was enough to place him fifth on the list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Before setting out this time, Zhu Xuanji had been summoned in private by the Southern Bean Kingdom’s monarch and was told of many secrets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Southern Bean Monarch had warned him, “Xuanji, you must tread carefully in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Long ago, Three Schools Supreme Sage left the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability in the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“This divine ability allows control over others of the same kind. The more one understands their kind, the greater the degree of control they can exert.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“If a Foundation Establishment cultivator has mastered this divine ability, even a Golden Core like you would be in grave danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“That’s because this divine ability’s control extends into even fate energy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhu Xuanji was astonished. “Is the Life-Hanging Thread capable of extracting another’s fate energy?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Not exactly.” The Southern Bean Monarch shook his head, continuing in a clear and crisp voice, “However, the Life-Hanging Thread can allow fate energies to accumulate and overlap without loss from internal conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“As long as a cultivator masters this divine ability, they can link to many others and bind their fate energies together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Our founding sovereign rose up from nothing, born without a royal mandate. She was only able to accomplish this due to Three Schools Supreme Sage creating the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability for her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“It was through the power of this divine ability that her many friends and subordinates were willing to lead the charge and sacrifice for her sake.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhu Xuanji showed a solemn expression and resolutely accepted the mission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He was a Golden Core cultivator. Although the grand formation would suppress him, few people in Fire Persimmon Immortal City could truly match up to his strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The real danger lay in losing the conflict between fate energy. If his fate energy were diminished, he would easily fall into seemingly coincidental yet deadly traps. At that point, even a Golden Core like himself would have nothing to rely on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Liu Ying had once been a suspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But now that the man was dead, Zhu Xuanji dismissed that suspicion. “It seems I was overthinking things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Then again, most of these suspects are mere Foundation Establishment cultivators. How could they possibly comprehend a divine ability?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">For the Southern Bean royal family, any divine abilities related to life and fate were deeply taboo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">After all, it was precisely thanks to one such divine ability that their founding sovereign had risen to power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">If someone possessing a divine ability like this were to appear in the Southern Bean royal family’s sphere of influence, they would much prefer to secretly eliminate that person and prevent any threat to their stable rule over Southern Bean Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">After the bequeathment ceremony ended, Ning Zhuo returned to clan territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Closing his eyes, he focused on his upper dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The lotus seed within his divine sea had already sprouted and was emanating a faint glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“An embryonic form of the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo had already comprehended the purpose of the divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Compared to spells evoked with magical power, the might and profundity of a divine ability was often far greater. This was because divine abilities were founded based on deep insight into the principles of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">For example, take Ning Zhuo. On the surface, it seemed that he had obtained inspiration from the immortal tale and grasped some profound truths to trigger the Illusory True Lotus Seed in his divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">But in reality, this was just the catalyst.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The more fundamental reason was that Ning Zhuo already held many insights into the way humans and society functioned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">These previous insights, when paired with the story of the holy immortal master, brought about a qualitative change. The Illusory True Lotus Seed sprouted, and the embryonic Life-Hanging Thread divine ability took form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">And it was precisely because the comprehension stemmed from his own thoughts that the divine ability’s uses became clear to him once it awakened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“If Han Ming’s Theory of Numbered Breaths is correct, then this may well be the fated opportunity I earned after my fate energy surged due to defeating Yuan Dasheng,” Ning Zhuo realized inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">As it turned out, Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng wasn’t the fated opportunity. After all, its core material was the corpse of Yuan Dasheng, which would have been in Ning Zhuo’s possession no matter what.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Fated opportunities often worked like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">For most people, a story might be nothing more than entertainment, yielding no tangible benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">But for a certain person, that same story could result in an unimaginable gain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">If it wasn’t your fated opportunity, you wouldn’t gain anything even if it was placed right in front of you.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“Uncle Ning.” Ning Zhuo took the initiative to seek out Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Xiaoren smiled and asked Ning Zhuo why he had come.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But when he heard the reason, his smile froze on his face. “You’re saying… you want to forgive your uncle Ning Ze?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo nodded. “Yes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“I’ve been agonizing over this matter for the past few days. But after deep thought, I’ve decided to forgive him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“After all, he is my blood-related uncle. He’s the closest family member I have left in this world.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Xiaoren was not pleased with this development.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">These past few days, he had done everything in his power to win Ning Zhuo over. He wanted the boy to feel that he, Ning Xiaoren, was the closest and most trustworthy person to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Little Zhuo, you are indeed a good and kindhearted child.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Anyone else would never forgive an uncle like that. But you are able to do so. I’m impressed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo smiled bashfully. “Blood runs thicker than water, after all. And Uncle Ning Ze and I are family…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“As long as he’s willing to pay back the spirit stones and resources he’s embezzled from me over the past sixteen years.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Ah.” Ning Xiaoren was stunned as he finally understood why Ning Zhuo had come to see him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He couldn’t help cursing inwardly. Did the boy have to pause like that while speaking? Couldn’t he finish saying everything in one go?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo cupped his fists and bowed. “I beg Sir Junior Patriarch to uphold justice for me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“This is a completely reasonable request.” Ning Xiaoren thought for a moment. “Little Zhuo, I will ensure justice is carried out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Not long after.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The two arrived at the clan’s private prison and met the incarcerated Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">When Ning Ze saw Ning Xiaoren appear, he assumed that he was being released and rushed over to the cell door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">But a moment later, Ning Zhuo revealed the true purpose behind their arrival.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“Uncle, I’ve thought it over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“You are still my uncle by blood. I don’t want to see you suffer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“So, pay me back all the spirit stones and cultivation resources you’ve embezzled over the years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“I’ll forgive you and won’t press charges!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Ze’s eyes went wide. He looked at Ning Zhuo, then quickly turned to Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">But Ning Xiaoren stood silently behind Ning Zhuo, already glaring with a face that said, “Don’t slip up, or you’ll face the consequences.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Ze’s lips trembled, and he barely suppressed his fury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">When had he ever embezzled Ning Zhuo’s spirit stones and cultivation resources? Ning Xiaoren had never given him any to begin with!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">But he couldn’t just say the truth here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Seeing Ning Zhuo staring at him, he wanted nothing more than to slap the boy across the face immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">But he knew that it wasn’t possible. Ning Zhuo’s status had completely changed. He was now heavily valued by the clan, and even the junior patriarch Ning Xiaoren was trying to win him over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">In the end, Ning Ze took a deep breath and gritted his teeth at Ning Zhuo. “Fine. I’ll pay you back.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Thank you, Uncle.” Ning Zhuo smiled brightly, then bowed to Ning Xiaoren. “And thank you, junior patriarch, for upholding justice on my behalf.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Xiaoren laughed heartily and patted Ning Zhuo on the shoulder. Inwardly, though, he was thinking, “This kid really is a bit too greedy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">On the other hand, Ning Ze was already roaring inside. “Justice my ass!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo already owned a thirty percent stake in the explosive fire monkey business, with another forty percent of the profits going to Fei Si. He was currently receiving abundant support from the tri-clan alliance as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">There was no need for him to covet these “embezzled resources”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">But to reassure Ning Xiaoren and deepen the impression of a young man greedy for wealth, Ning Zhuo still chose to act this way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">A few days later, Ning Zhuo took his leave from Ning Xiaoren’s residence, saying that he missed his home and wished to stay there for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Xiaoren had long grown tired of Ning Zhuo eating and drinking in his house for free, and even sleeping in his bedroom without paying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Now that Ning Zhuo had made a clean break with Ning Ze, there was nothing holding him back. Ning Xiaoren pretended to be reluctant for a while, but still agreed after repeated pleas from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
