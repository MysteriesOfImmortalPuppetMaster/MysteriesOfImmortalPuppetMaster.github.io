<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Flames soared into the sky as a violent explosion shattered several puppets rushing forward into pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Something's wrong! Everyone, be careful," Ning Zhuo shouted, warning the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Did we really eliminate the Mechanical Apes?" Zhou Zeshen frowned deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The next moment, the door before them was pushed open, and three Mechanical Apes, all resembling the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, entered in single file.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"How can there be so many?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Is it because we have a large group, so the Lava Immortal Palace increased the difficulty?" "But this is too much, isn't it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Before the group could react, the three Mechanical Apes launched their attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Change formation, use the battle array!" Zhu Xuanji commanded in a low voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The Zhou family cultivators stepped forward, forming a human wall to block the three Mechanical Apes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">However, before they could activate the battle array, another violent explosion occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Amidst the flames and smoke, the Zhou family cultivators were covered in dust and ashes, but the casualties were minimal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Their battle array greatly increased their defensive power, making them much more resilient than fighting individually.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">However, taking advantage of the explosion, the remaining two Mechanical Apes had already charged to the rear line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The rear cultivators were thrown into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Their coordination was no match for the Zhou family cultivators, and more critically, the middle of the team was filled with mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Another violent explosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The explosion directly destroyed over twenty mechanical constructs, rendering the previous efforts to create them useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The remaining Mechanical Ape rampaged through the crowd, causing everyone to retreat in fear of being blown up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">For a moment, the cultivators' formation was in disarray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">In the critical moment, Ning Zhuo stepped forward: "Everyone, move aside, let me handle this!" The crowd quickly made way, and Ning Zhuo, wielding a giant axe, charged forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The giant axe was larger than his entire puppet body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo swung the axe with great momentum, creating a fierce wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Floating around him were various floating hands, continuously casting spells, bombarding the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">According to their secret rehearsal, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng moved nimbly, dodging the spells with great agility, then charged at Ning Zhuo, delivering a powerful push.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo quickly raised his giant axe to block the attack, but he was still sent flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was about to pursue when Zhou Zhu blocked its path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">After a few rounds, Zhou Zhu was also knocked down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But at this moment, Zhou Zeshen, Zheng Jian, and Ning Xiaohui surrounded the ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Relying on the full strength of the genius cultivators, the three families barely managed to stabilize the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"This is the real Mechanical Ape, the others are simple constructs meant to self-destruct!" In the midst of the fierce battle, a cultivator inspected the battlefield and discovered the truth, quickly shouting to inform the others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Everyone's hearts sank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">They had been deceived!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">They had wasted a large amount of resources, creating eight crossbow carts that were now useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"We're ready, lure it in quickly!" The Zhou family battle array was fully activated, exerting its maximum power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Each member of the Zhou family in the formation bore the heavy burden of maintaining and operating the living array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zhou Zhu and the others fought while retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Yuan Dasheng did not pursue, instead focusing on destroying the mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Seeing that Yuan Dasheng was not falling for the trap, the crowd grew increasingly anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"This guy has become too cunning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo said, "It's probably the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit controlling it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">These words immediately infuriated the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, causing it to spew a mouthful of red fire in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Indeed, it's controlled by a spirit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"No wonder spiritual treasures can guard families, sects, and nations." The combined forces of the three families immediately became more vigilant, facing the situation with full strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The crowd surrounded and blocked the ape, with many even sacrificing themselves to delay the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng for a few breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo fought fiercely while assisting Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">During special training, he understood the power of the Zhou family's battle array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">If Yuan Dasheng got trapped, it would be difficult to escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">At that time, the various mechanical constructs prepared for him would be unleashed, and Yuan Dasheng would be doomed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Cheng Bai, join the battle!" Ning Zhuo secretly controlled the Life Hanging by a Thread, ordering Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Cheng Bai pushed open the door and rushed into the battlefield, causing a collective gasp from the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"It's here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"The slave ghost puppet has appeared."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Quick, follow the plan and contain it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhou Zhu took the lead, wielding the Mud Gate Earth Hammer, charging at Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Zheng Jian temporarily used his bow and arrow components, shooting arrows at Cheng Bai's face before Zhou Zhu arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">But Cheng Bai merely lowered his head slightly, using his hat-like head to deflect the arrows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Sparks flew as the arrows slid off the curved surface of his head, flying into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Zheng Jian's pupils contracted in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">According to the information, the slave ghost puppet's defense shouldn't be this strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Its materials have been upgraded!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Not just it, but also the Mechanical Apes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zheng Jian turned his head, observing for a moment before confirming that Yuan Dasheng, though seemingly the same as the information, had undergone many material upgrades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Damn it, the Lava Immortal Palace has indeed increased the difficulty!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">In the original plan, Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu were to engage in close combat to entangle Cheng Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">But now, with Cheng Bai significantly enhanced, Zheng Jian's confidence wavered, feeling that the original battle plan was flawed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Don't panic! I'll handle it!" Ning Zhuo shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">He donned the mechanical constructs he had created.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Two breaths later, he was equipped with modified hanging rings on his neck, wrists, ankles, and other parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo, wielding the giant axe, charged at Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">During the fight, the hanging rings on Ning Zhuo's body continuously sprayed threads, attaching to the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Yuan Dasheng's movements slowed significantly, giving others an opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Zhou family's battle array finally managed to trap Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Good job, Ning Zhuo!" Zheng Jian praised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The Grasp Fire Technique further enhanced, bathing it in crimson flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Hehe, Brother Ning, you are indeed reliable at critical moments," Zhou Zeshen transmitted his voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Yuan Dasheng roared, casting a spell for the first time—Grasp Fire Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The flames burned, incinerating Ning Zhuo's threads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Yuan Dasheng continued to roar, opening the door again, this time releasing a large number of Mechanical Wind Fire Wheels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The Wind Fire Wheels moved at high speed, spewing flames as they rolled, with great power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Many puppet bodies were burned to ashes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The three families' cultivators were tormented by the Wind Fire Wheels, retreating step by step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Why are these wheels so agile?" Many cultivators cast spells, repeatedly missing their targets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Mechanical Wind Fire Wheels were more agile than anyone had imagined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"How could they not be agile? I cremated them one by one, gaining their spirituality. They will all shine brilliantly in this battle," Ning Zhuo thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"We can't hold on!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"The casualties are severe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Use the smoke carts!!" Some people loudly requested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"No, those are prepared for the puppet's ghost army." Ning Zhuo immediately refused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The fierce battle continued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The Wind Fire Wheels rampaged, burning puppets one after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The casualties reached forty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Use the smoke carts, they can block these wheels!" Someone suggested again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"No, if we use them, and the opponent releases ghosts, we won't have effective means to deal with them." Ning Zhuo refused again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The casualties reached sixty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Ah!" A cultivator shouted, finally unable to bear it, about to activate the smoke carts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">But Ning Zhuo, with quick reflexes, stopped him: "Endure, endure! Small impatience spoils great plans!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Before long, Yuan Dasheng broke through the Zhou family's battle array, about to escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Where do you think you're going!" Ning Xie finally couldn't bear it, launching an attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Senior Ning Xie, I'll assist you." Ning Xiaohui unleashed the Ice Jade Hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Xie cast Snow Soul Ice Essence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The two joined forces, unleashing peak Foundation Establishment level power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The temperature dropped sharply, and ice crystals formed, quickly turning the entire room white.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Yuan Dasheng was heavily targeted, struggling to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The flames on its body fought hard against the extreme cold and ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Let me deliver the final blow!" Ning Zhuo shouted, leaping high into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He raised the giant axe above his head and then swung it down fiercely!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">However, just as everyone watched with anticipation, Ning Xiaohui inexplicably changed the direction of her spell, enveloping Ning Zhuo as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ice quickly formed on Ning Zhuo, freezing him solid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The next moment, Yuan Dasheng attacked, piercing Ning Zhuo's chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Then, it lifted its leg, sweeping Ning Zhuo's upper body, including his head, far away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Ning Xiaohui!" Ning Zhuo roared in extreme anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The crowd was shocked and furious, many unable to comprehend what had just happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">With the enemy at hand, someone had taken personal revenge so blatantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Ning Xiaohui, you disgrace the main family!" Ning Chen shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Yong roared, "Ning Xiaohui, what are you doing? Without Brother Zhuo, how can we deal with the Mechanical Apes?" Ning Xiaohui was stunned: "I, I did this?" She didn't know why she had done it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">In her daze, she exposed a huge flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Three Mechanical Wind Fire Wheels came from three directions, crushing and colliding with her, shattering her body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Without a host, Ning Xie roared in anger, about to be expelled from the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">But the next moment, Cheng Bai arrived, pointing a finger, releasing a group of mechanical ropes from his sleeve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The mechanical ropes, like a swarm of snakes, bound Ning Xie tightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Someone save me!" Ning Xie became powerless, his face changing dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The next moment, Cheng Bai arrived, standing before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The array and spells activated simultaneously, forcibly suppressing Ning Xie!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The battle continued for another tea's time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai were both severely wounded, narrowly achieving victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The combined forces of the three families were defeated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">After the battle, countless people exited the Immortal Palace, glaring at Ning Xiaohui with intense hostility, their resentment like a volcano about to erupt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Xiaohui's face was ashen, and she quickly distanced herself from the crowd.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Many people stepped forward to comfort Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo's face was ironclad: "So close to success, so close!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"This wasn't your fault."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"Cheer up, Brother Zhuo! You performed the best."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"Ning Zhuo, this time I'm on your side. Ning Xiaohui must give us all an explanation!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
