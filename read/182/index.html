<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 182: Ning Xiaohui, What Have You Done?!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Flames soared into the sky as a violent explosion shattered several puppets rushing forward into pieces.<br/>
<br/>
"Something's wrong! Everyone, be careful," Ning Zhuo shouted, warning the others.<br/>
<br/>
"Did we really eliminate the Mechanical Apes?" Zhou Zeshen frowned deeply.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, the door before them was pushed open, and three Mechanical Apes, all resembling the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, entered in single file.<br/>
<br/>
"How can there be so many?"<br/>
<br/>
"Is it because we have a large group, so the Lava Immortal Palace increased the difficulty?" "But this is too much, isn't it?"<br/>
<br/>
Before the group could react, the three Mechanical Apes launched their attack.<br/>
<br/>
"Change formation, use the battle array!" Zhu Xuanji commanded in a low voice.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family cultivators stepped forward, forming a human wall to block the three Mechanical Apes.<br/>
<br/>
However, before they could activate the battle array, another violent explosion occurred.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the flames and smoke, the Zhou family cultivators were covered in dust and ashes, but the casualties were minimal.<br/>
<br/>
Their battle array greatly increased their defensive power, making them much more resilient than fighting individually.<br/>
<br/>
However, taking advantage of the explosion, the remaining two Mechanical Apes had already charged to the rear line.<br/>
<br/>
The rear cultivators were thrown into chaos.<br/>
<br/>
Their coordination was no match for the Zhou family cultivators, and more critically, the middle of the team was filled with mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Another violent explosion.<br/>
<br/>
The explosion directly destroyed over twenty mechanical constructs, rendering the previous efforts to create them useless.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining Mechanical Ape rampaged through the crowd, causing everyone to retreat in fear of being blown up.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the cultivators' formation was in disarray.<br/>
<br/>
In the critical moment, Ning Zhuo stepped forward: "Everyone, move aside, let me handle this!" The crowd quickly made way, and Ning Zhuo, wielding a giant axe, charged forward.<br/>
<br/>
The giant axe was larger than his entire puppet body.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo swung the axe with great momentum, creating a fierce wind.<br/>
<br/>
Floating around him were various floating hands, continuously casting spells, bombarding the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
According to their secret rehearsal, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng moved nimbly, dodging the spells with great agility, then charged at Ning Zhuo, delivering a powerful push.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly raised his giant axe to block the attack, but he was still sent flying.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was about to pursue when Zhou Zhu blocked its path.<br/>
<br/>
After a few rounds, Zhou Zhu was also knocked down.<br/>
<br/>
But at this moment, Zhou Zeshen, Zheng Jian, and Ning Xiaohui surrounded the ape.<br/>
<br/>
Relying on the full strength of the genius cultivators, the three families barely managed to stabilize the situation.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the real Mechanical Ape, the others are simple constructs meant to self-destruct!" In the midst of the fierce battle, a cultivator inspected the battlefield and discovered the truth, quickly shouting to inform the others.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone's hearts sank.<br/>
<br/>
They had been deceived!<br/>
<br/>
They had wasted a large amount of resources, creating eight crossbow carts that were now useless.<br/>
<br/>
"We're ready, lure it in quickly!" The Zhou family battle array was fully activated, exerting its maximum power.<br/>
<br/>
Each member of the Zhou family in the formation bore the heavy burden of maintaining and operating the living array.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu and the others fought while retreating.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng did not pursue, instead focusing on destroying the mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that Yuan Dasheng was not falling for the trap, the crowd grew increasingly anxious.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it!"<br/>
<br/>
"This guy has become too cunning."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, "It's probably the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit controlling it!"<br/>
<br/>
These words immediately infuriated the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, causing it to spew a mouthful of red fire in anger.<br/>
<br/>
"Indeed, it's controlled by a spirit."<br/>
<br/>
"No wonder spiritual treasures can guard families, sects, and nations." The combined forces of the three families immediately became more vigilant, facing the situation with full strength.<br/>
<br/>
The crowd surrounded and blocked the ape, with many even sacrificing themselves to delay the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng for a few breaths.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo fought fiercely while assisting Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
During special training, he understood the power of the Zhou family's battle array.<br/>
<br/>
If Yuan Dasheng got trapped, it would be difficult to escape.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, the various mechanical constructs prepared for him would be unleashed, and Yuan Dasheng would be doomed!<br/>
<br/>
"Cheng Bai, join the battle!" Ning Zhuo secretly controlled the Life-Hanging Thread, ordering Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai pushed open the door and rushed into the battlefield, causing a collective gasp from the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
"It's here!"<br/>
<br/>
"The slave ghost puppet has appeared."<br/>
<br/>
"Quick, follow the plan and contain it!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu took the lead, wielding the Mud Gate Earth Hammer, charging at Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian temporarily used his bow and arrow components, shooting arrows at Cheng Bai's face before Zhou Zhu arrived.<br/>
<br/>
But Cheng Bai merely lowered his head slightly, using his hat-like head to deflect the arrows.<br/>
<br/>
Sparks flew as the arrows slid off the curved surface of his head, flying into the air.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian's pupils contracted in surprise.<br/>
<br/>
According to the information, the slave ghost puppet's defense shouldn't be this strong.<br/>
<br/>
"Its materials have been upgraded!"<br/>
<br/>
"Not just it, but also the Mechanical Apes."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian turned his head, observing for a moment before confirming that Yuan Dasheng, though seemingly the same as the information, had undergone many material upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it, the Lava Immortal Palace has indeed increased the difficulty!"<br/>
<br/>
In the original plan, Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu were to engage in close combat to entangle Cheng Bai.<br/>
<br/>
But now, with Cheng Bai significantly enhanced, Zheng Jian's confidence wavered, feeling that the original battle plan was flawed.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't panic! I'll handle it!" Ning Zhuo shouted.<br/>
<br/>
He donned the mechanical constructs he had created.<br/>
<br/>
Two breaths later, he was equipped with modified hanging rings on his neck, wrists, ankles, and other parts.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, wielding the giant axe, charged at Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
During the fight, the hanging rings on Ning Zhuo's body continuously sprayed threads, attaching to the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's movements slowed significantly, giving others an opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family's battle array finally managed to trap Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
"Good job, Ning Zhuo!" Zheng Jian praised.<br/>
<br/>
The Grasp Fire Technique further enhanced, bathing it in crimson flames.<br/>
<br/>
"Hehe, Brother Ning, you are indeed reliable at critical moments," Zhou Zeshen transmitted his voice.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng roared, casting a spell for the first time‚ÄîGrasp Fire Technique.<br/>
<br/>
The flames burned, incinerating Ning Zhuo's threads.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng continued to roar, opening the door again, this time releasing a large number of Mechanical Wind Fire Wheels.<br/>
<br/>
The Wind Fire Wheels moved at high speed, spewing flames as they rolled, with great power.<br/>
<br/>
Many puppet bodies were burned to ashes.<br/>
<br/>
The three families' cultivators were tormented by the Wind Fire Wheels, retreating step by step.<br/>
<br/>
"Why are these wheels so agile?" Many cultivators cast spells, repeatedly missing their targets.<br/>
<br/>
The Mechanical Wind Fire Wheels were more agile than anyone had imagined.<br/>
<br/>
"How could they not be agile? I cremated them one by one, gaining their spirituality. They will all shine brilliantly in this battle," Ning Zhuo thought.<br/>
<br/>
"We can't hold on!"<br/>
<br/>
"The casualties are severe."<br/>
<br/>
"Use the smoke carts!!" Some people loudly requested.<br/>
<br/>
"No, those are prepared for the puppet's ghost army." Ning Zhuo immediately refused.<br/>
<br/>
The fierce battle continued.<br/>
<br/>
The Wind Fire Wheels rampaged, burning puppets one after another.<br/>
<br/>
The casualties reached forty percent.<br/>
<br/>
"Use the smoke carts, they can block these wheels!" Someone suggested again.<br/>
<br/>
"No, if we use them, and the opponent releases ghosts, we won't have effective means to deal with them." Ning Zhuo refused again.<br/>
<br/>
The casualties reached sixty percent.<br/>
<br/>
"Ah!" A cultivator shouted, finally unable to bear it, about to activate the smoke carts.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo, with quick reflexes, stopped him: "Endure, endure! Small impatience spoils great plans!"<br/>
<br/>
Before long, Yuan Dasheng broke through the Zhou family's battle array, about to escape.<br/>
<br/>
"Where do you think you're going!" Ning Xie finally couldn't bear it, launching an attack.<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Ning Xie, I'll assist you." Ning Xiaohui unleashed the Ice Jade Hand.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xie cast Snow Soul Ice Essence!<br/>
<br/>
The two joined forces, unleashing peak Foundation Establishment level power.<br/>
<br/>
The temperature dropped sharply, and ice crystals formed, quickly turning the entire room white.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng was heavily targeted, struggling to move.<br/>
<br/>
The flames on its body fought hard against the extreme cold and ice.<br/>
<br/>
"Let me deliver the final blow!" Ning Zhuo shouted, leaping high into the air.<br/>
<br/>
He raised the giant axe above his head and then swung it down fiercely!<br/>
<br/>
However, just as everyone watched with anticipation, Ning Xiaohui inexplicably changed the direction of her spell, enveloping Ning Zhuo as well.<br/>
<br/>
Ice quickly formed on Ning Zhuo, freezing him solid.<br/>
<br/>
Bang.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Yuan Dasheng attacked, piercing Ning Zhuo's chest.<br/>
<br/>
Then, it lifted its leg, sweeping Ning Zhuo's upper body, including his head, far away.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui!" Ning Zhuo roared in extreme anger.<br/>
<br/>
The crowd was shocked and furious, many unable to comprehend what had just happened.<br/>
<br/>
With the enemy at hand, someone had taken personal revenge so blatantly.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui, you disgrace the main family!" Ning Chen shouted.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Yong roared, "Ning Xiaohui, what are you doing? Without Brother Zhuo, how can we deal with the Mechanical Apes?" Ning Xiaohui was stunned: "I, I did this?" She didn't know why she had done it.<br/>
<br/>
In her daze, she exposed a huge flaw.<br/>
<br/>
Three Mechanical Wind Fire Wheels came from three directions, crushing and colliding with her, shattering her body.<br/>
<br/>
Without a host, Ning Xie roared in anger, about to be expelled from the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
But the next moment, Cheng Bai arrived, pointing a finger, releasing a group of mechanical ropes from his sleeve.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical ropes, like a swarm of snakes, bound Ning Xie tightly.<br/>
<br/>
"Someone save me!" Ning Xie became powerless, his face changing dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Cheng Bai arrived, standing before him.<br/>
<br/>
The array and spells activated simultaneously, forcibly suppressing Ning Xie!<br/>
<br/>
The battle continued for another tea's time.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai were both severely wounded, narrowly achieving victory.<br/>
<br/>
The combined forces of the three families were defeated!<br/>
<br/>
After the battle, countless people exited the Immortal Palace, glaring at Ning Xiaohui with intense hostility, their resentment like a volcano about to erupt.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's face was ashen, and she quickly distanced herself from the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
Many people stepped forward to comfort Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face was ironclad: "So close to success, so close!"<br/>
<br/>
"This wasn't your fault."<br/>
<br/>
"Cheer up, Brother Zhuo! You performed the best."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, this time I'm on your side. Ning Xiaohui must give us all an explanation!"</div>
