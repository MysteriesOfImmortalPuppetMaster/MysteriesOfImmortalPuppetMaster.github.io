<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Seal of the Garrison General was distributed the following day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">It was made entirely of bronze, with a perfectly square face, each side measuring about three inches, and it was quite heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">On the top of the seal was carved a soaring swallow, its tail sharp as scissors, wings spread, giving the impression of flying swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The inscription read "Garrison General" in sharp strokes, symbolizing that the subordinates of the Garrison General often possess the ability to quickly move and excel in ambush tasks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Zhang Hei rubbed the Garrison General's Seal with his thick fingers and gripped it tightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Immediately, he stuffed the seal into his bosom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Guan Hong didn’t even glance at it, taking it for herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Liu Er, however, examined the Seal in his hands and pondered: "The Garrison General's seal is finely carved, and I heard the seal of General Zuo Yang features a fierce lion pouncing down."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Liu Er was of mixed human and demon blood, his four ears being clear evidence. In other cultivation nations, it was quite rare to award someone of his background with a general position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Sweetly said, he was a relative of the Blood-Remnant Dynasty. However, to put it more bluntly, such relatives were rather numerous, and the influence of the Blood-Remnant Dynasty had long since sunk into the mire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo was also examining the seal in his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This was the seal of his military advisor Yu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The seal face was circular, two inches in diameter, made of jade, giving a warm touch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">On the front of the seal was carved a bright moon and clouds, with the inscription "Military Advisor Jiji," calm and clear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Holding the seal slightly, Ning Zhuo infused it with magical power, making it glow faintly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhang Hei saw this and laughed: "A mere small seal, what’s there to try? High-ranking military seals and official seals carry military tactics and official arts. We don't even have a Garrison General's seal, let alone your Military Advisor Jiji seal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Liu Er collected his emotions and stored the seal carefully, seeing Ning Zhuo’s studious demeanor, unable to help but chuckle: "Ning Little Brother, if you want a better seal, you could earn some merit, and I will report it, so you can be promoted a couple of ranks. How does that sound?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo hurriedly declined: "This is just my first time obtaining such a national artifact, merely studying it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“I’m not very interested in the official seals of the two nations. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Because my clan is located in the Southern Bean Kingdom, if I want to hold an official position or command an army in the future, I must seek favor from the Southern Bean Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"To be candid with the three generals, I am close friends with the royal family member Zhu Xuanji of the Southern Bean Kingdom. He tends to award me an official position."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"I am self-aware; my cultivation is only at the early stage of foundation Establishment, and I need much more practice. It's currently difficult to achieve a great undertaking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"This time, I am following the three generals, hoping to leverage your powers to participate in battle and see if there’s an opportunity for my clan to take revenge on the Six Caves Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Afterward, I also need to carry precious materials and reach a trade deal with some major force to fulfill my clan’s mission."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"And further on, I want to travel to more places to broaden my horizons."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zhang Hei squinted: "Zhu Xuanji of the Southern Bean Kingdom? He is a renowned Detective. I've heard of him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhang Hei looked at Ning Zhuo again. He didn’t expect the Foundation Establishment cultivator before him to have close ties to a famous person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Liu Er’s regret deepened upon hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo possessed precious materials, was very wealthy, and had a unique grasp of earth techniques; although he was only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment, his combat power was outstanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Now hearing of Ning Zhuo's strong connections, even Zhu Xuanji looked favorably upon him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Liu Er's inquiries were to draw Ning Zhuo in, use the Ning family for his own purposes. Yet, Ning Zhuo’s words made him realize the young cultivator before him could not be underestimated. He was a young master of the Ning family with deep connections to the royal family of the Southern Bean Kingdom, possessing a significant background —someone like him could not easily be won over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“At least, I can’t win him over right now!” Liu Er gritted his teeth secretly, feeling his thirst for fame and fortune intensifying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In the evening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">A troop slowly entered the Celestial City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The rays of the setting sun illuminated their golden armor, further enhancing their nobility and majesty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Golden Halberd Army!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">One of the two forbidden military forces of the two nations formally arrived at the City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Although this news had already spread throughout the city, seeing such a disciplined army in person made the citizens solemn, and they couldn’t help but exclaim in their hearts: Such a strong army!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The military flag fluttered, rustling in the evening wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The whole army rode horses, the sound of hooves heavy and powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Every soldier held a golden long halberd, upright towards the sky, forming a forest of weapons, emitting an endless sharp aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Gan, as the commander of the Golden Halberd Army, rode at the front of the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">His face was cold, eyes sharp as blades, sweeping around, making the citizens instinctively avert their gazes, not daring to make eye contact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">In stark contrast to him was a diplomat of the two nations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Although he also rode a fine horse and sat upright, his demeanor was incompatible with that of the Golden Halberd Army, clearly an outsider.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">But no one dared to underestimate this official.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">For the clothes he wore and the staff he held indicated his identity—an imperial envoy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Unlike other armies, the Golden Halberd Army had the fewest numbers yet was the most loyal and reliable, hence they did not camp outside the city but directly settled inside Celestial City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The city lord had long arranged accommodations, proactively welcoming Sun Gan and the envoy, enthusiastically inviting them to join the evening banquet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sun Gan's face was as hard as iron; he stated that he must first settle the army before considering attending the banquet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The envoy laughed heartily, asking for the banquet to include the heads of several armies so he could bond with these colleagues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Sun Gan chuckled coldly upon hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">It was because this envoy, named Zhao Yuan, was notoriously greedy. Every time he traveled, he used his power to solicit bribes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Sun Gan found it reprehensible, yet Zhao Yuan was trusted by the upper echelons of the two nations, often dispatched on various missions no matter how many complaints were lodged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The banquet was quite lavish, filled with the local specialties of Celestial City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The banquet had both an inner and outer hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Ning Zhuo Little Friend?" In the outer hall, Zhang Zhongyi was surprised to see Ning Zhuo step in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">As the military advisor, Ning Zhuo was considered a senior figure in an army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">This was the advantage of joining the Three Generals Battalion; positions were open in the early stages, and with a small contribution, one could attain high rank.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Seeing Zhang Zhongyi, Ning Zhuo was also delighted. After chatting, he sat directly to Zhang Zhongyi’s left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo did not conceal his status or the necessity of doing so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"You joined the Three Generals Battalion and even became their military advisor?" Zhang Zhongyi exclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Though he held a high reputation, he was merely a military doctor, unable to participate in the decision-making of the Red Flower Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">From this perspective, Ning Zhuo’s status was already higher than his.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo quietly informed Zhang Zhongyi that it was by coincidence that he heard Liu, Guan, and Zhang discussing the organization of a new army. He took the initiative to express his desire to join.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">For this, he even presented the three generals with three pieces of precious materials: the Xuan Huang Mother Stone, Blood Bamboo Stone, and Nether Black Pond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhang Zhongyi immediately examined Ning Zhuo, astonished by the financial power of this Foundation Establishment cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Being able to present such precious materials proved Ning Zhuo had at least a few more!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Unfortunately, Mu Lan did not heed my advice. If she had recruited Ning Zhuo, how wonderful would that be."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Sigh!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Her bow needs replacement; otherwise, she cannot fully utilize her exceptional archery skills. If only we had some Nascent Soul level materials..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Zhang Zhongyi shook his head continuously in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The night banquet began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo and Zhang Zhongyi chatted while dining, frequently toasting the people at the same table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Suddenly, the door to the inner hall was pushed open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Mu Lan stormed out in a huff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Zhao Yuan, you are the notorious worm of our two nations!" Mu Lan shouted angrily, scanning the room until her gaze landed on Zhang Zhongyi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">She also noticed Ning Zhuo, her gaze lingering on him for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Mu Lan then said: "Zhang, let’s go. This banquet may be nice, but the small-mindedness of the people at the table truly disgusts me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Under the attention of many, Zhang Zhongyi immediately stood up, his face displaying anger: "General, old man follows closely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Though Zhang Zhongyi sighed inwardly, anticipating this situation, now was not the time to persuade Mu Lan. He left the table immediately to display unity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The night banquet had not yet begun for long before Mu Lan and Zhang Zhongyi furiously departed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Come on, continue eating and drinking!" Zhao Si loudly encouraged, attempting to liven the atmosphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He was incredibly thick-skinned, almost shameless, seemingly oblivious to Mu Lan’s criticism of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Shuang Jing, Xu Dali, and others quickly raised their cups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Liu Er was among them, but only sported a bitter smile. Zhao Yuan’s earlier mention of "travel compensation" was simply extortionate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">At another table in the inner hall, Zhang Hei raised his head, pouring more wine down his throat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Guan Hong sat upright, stroking his long beard, keeping a keen eye on the main table's discussions, his eyes flashing with cold light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">As the feast ended, the group of four walked home, and Liu Er looked up at the bright moon in the night sky, sighing deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Why does the elder brother look so upset?" Zhang Hei asked, yawning and staggering from drunkenness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Guan Hong snorted coldly and recounted the events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Zhang Hei exclaimed: "That envoy dares to openly solicit bribes? How outrageous! Is the two-nation regime really this corrupt?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"If we succeed in our future endeavors, will we also be treated harshly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Liu Er waved his hand: "That won’t happen. The recruitment order issued personally by the monarch of the two nations concerns him, the royal family, and the prestige of the two nations. In this respect, they will definitely strive for fairness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Liu Er feared Zhang Hei would hold a grudge, as he wanted to achieve great things in the two nations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Among all the surrounding cultivation nations, only the two nations opened such opportunities for someone like him, a mixed-blood human-demon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Zhang Hei grumbled: "That's good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"I felt from the first sight that this dog envoy was looking at people with a slant eye; he’s clearly not a good person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Why should we care about him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Although he is an envoy, he is not our direct superior. If we can avoid a confrontation with him, that itself is a good outcome. He even wants our money?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"That's simply unacceptable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Our money is already stretched thin; it's meant for forming an army."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Liu Er could only sigh deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "Gentlemen, don’t worry. I will handle the envoy's matters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Based on my silver tongue, I will make him understand that the honor of the three generals cannot be insulted by mere wealth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Liu Er then looked to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo gave Liu Er a meaningful smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Liu Er was momentarily startled, then ordered Ning Zhuo to represent him and manage this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"There's no time to lose; I'll return to clarify matters with that envoy," Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Liu Er agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Zhang Hei wanted to support Ning Zhuo: "The military advisor's cultivation is merely Foundation Establishment; how can he face that Golden Dan envoy? It's better for me to accompany you to increase our stature."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, politely refusing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Liu Er took the initiative to grasp Zhang Hei's shoulder, expressing his full confidence in Ning Zhuo, asserting that doubting Ning Zhuo’s ability was underestimating our younger brother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Zhang Hei was momentarily dazed by this remark and had to watch Ning Zhuo head back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Moments later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo was all smiles, and envoy Zhao Si was also smiling broadly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">He was brightly lit as he continually thumbed through the precious materials in his hands, sounding off loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"The three generals of the Garrison Battalion are indeed remarkable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Those who recognize the times are wise!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo took out another precious material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"I have a close relationship with Lord Zhang Zhongyi and aim to rely on him to help my friend."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"I also ask you, My Lord, to go easy on the Red Flower Battalion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Zhao Yuan cast a deep glance at Ning Zhuo: "Kid, some matters are not for a foreigner like you from the Southern Bean Kingdom to meddle in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"The troubles of General Mu Lan are far greater than you imagined."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo smiled: "I understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">As he spoke, he took out a Nascent Soul precious material and placed it on the table: "If there’s a big problem, naturally I will trouble you further. Adding another precious material is completely reasonable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Zhao Yuan's eyes widened, deeply shaken by Ning Zhuo's display of wealth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"The Ning family Fire Persimmon Immortal City must be a great clan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Why did they only pass through the two nations and not settle down? They migrated to the Southern Bean Kingdom?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Zhao Yuan thought of this and felt a sense of regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"How many precious materials does this kid still have? Since he likes to meddle in other affairs..." This greedy thought just surfaced when he quickly dismissed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Life and death hung by a thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The Buddhist Heart Demon's Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Ning Zhuo maintained a gentle smile, but was continuously upholding these two measures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Lord Zhao, I helped the Red Flower Battalion just to make a good impression on Lord Zhang Zhongyi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"If possible, please grant me a small convenience."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"I would never put you in a difficult position; I just need some cooperation from you..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Influenced discreetly, Zhao Yuan nodded immediately upon hearing Ning Zhuo’s specific request: "Who made me look fondly upon this kid? Rest assured, I agree."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo once again indicated that after the matter was accomplished, he would offer a small token of appreciation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Zhao Yuan nodded repeatedly: "The Ning family’s education must be deep-rooted, with such values. It indeed makes us admire."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Military supplies were distributed, but the Red Flower Battalion had yet to receive theirs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Mu Lan, furious, made a scene, but the cultivator responsible for logistics had already prepared a perfect excuse, deliberately continuing to delay distribution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Zhang Zhongyi sighed immediately upon hearing this, knowing it was Zhao Si’s doing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Just then, Ning Zhuo came to visit. Upon seeing Zhang Zhongyi’s furrowed brow, he inquired about the reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">After learning of the situation, Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and told Zhang Zhongyi: Previously, he represented the Three Generals Battalion in delivering goods, which had pleased Zhao Yuan. Perhaps today, they might visit again, allowing the envoy to lift his hand on this occasion and let him cover the difference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Moments later, Ning Zhuo returned after handling the matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Zhang Zhongyi changed his previous demeanor, took Ning Zhuo's hand, and expressed deep gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">"Mu Lan is strong-willed, resembling her father. If I were to act, she would resent me, further creating a rift. I was caught in a dilemma until Ning Zhuo took action."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Ning Zhuo responded: "I also have a personal stake in this, Lord Zhang; I want to help my friend."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"Well said, well said!" Zhang Zhongyi waved dismissively, "This time, I’ll waive all consultation fees."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Ning Zhuo clapped the traveling dragon box at his waist, releasing Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">At this moment, even Sun Ling Tong's little butt turned to stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">He, however, was not in a hurry, still laughing nonchalantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Zhang Zhongyi skeptically remarked: "To save the little one, we still need a Master of Earth Techniques; you haven’t forgotten that, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands towards Zhang Zhongyi and slightly bowed: "Lord Zhang, don’t take offense; I myself am the Master of Earth Techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Zhang Zhongyi raised an eyebrow, looking incredulously at the white-clad youth before him: "You?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Ning Zhuo stood upright, arms relaxed, wearing a smile: "No fake, guaranteed." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Sun Lingtong: "Hehe! Little Ning, Dr. Zhang, please act swiftly; I can hardly wait!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
