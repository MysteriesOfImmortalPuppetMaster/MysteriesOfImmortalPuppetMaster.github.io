<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The Seal of the Garrison General was distributed the following day.<br/>
<br/>
It was made entirely of bronze, with a perfectly square face, each side measuring about three inches, and it was quite heavy.<br/>
<br/>
On the top of the seal was carved a soaring swallow, its tail sharp as scissors, wings spread, giving the impression of flying swiftly.<br/>
<br/>
The inscription read "Garrison General" in sharp strokes, symbolizing that the subordinates of the Garrison General often possess the ability to quickly move and excel in ambush tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei rubbed the Garrison General's Seal with his thick fingers and gripped it tightly.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, he stuffed the seal into his bosom.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong didn’t even glance at it, taking it for herself.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, however, examined the Seal in his hands and pondered: "The Garrison General's seal is finely carved, and I heard the seal of General Zuo Yang features a fierce lion pouncing down."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was of mixed human and demon blood, his four ears being clear evidence. In other cultivation nations, it was quite rare to award someone of his background with a general position.<br/>
<br/>
Sweetly said, he was a relative of the Blood-Remnant Dynasty. However, to put it more bluntly, such relatives were rather numerous, and the influence of the Blood-Remnant Dynasty had long since sunk into the mire.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was also examining the seal in his hands.<br/>
<br/>
This was the seal of his military advisor Yu Jiu.<br/>
<br/>
The seal face was circular, two inches in diameter, made of jade, giving a warm touch.<br/>
<br/>
On the front of the seal was carved a bright moon and clouds, with the inscription "Military Advisor Jiji," calm and clear.<br/>
<br/>
Holding the seal slightly, Ning Zhuo infused it with magical power, making it glow faintly.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei saw this and laughed: "A mere small seal, what’s there to try? High-ranking military seals and official seals carry military tactics and official arts. We don't even have a Garrison General's seal, let alone your Military Advisor Jiji seal."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er collected his emotions and stored the seal carefully, seeing Ning Zhuo’s studious demeanor, unable to help but chuckle: "Ning Little Brother, if you want a better seal, you could earn some merit, and I will report it, so you can be promoted a couple of ranks. How does that sound?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly declined: "This is just my first time obtaining such a national artifact, merely studying it."<br/>
<br/>
“I’m not very interested in the official seals of the two nations. <br/>
<br/>
"Because my clan is located in the Southern Bean Kingdom, if I want to hold an official position or command an army in the future, I must seek favor from the Southern Bean Kingdom."<br/>
<br/>
"To be candid with the three generals, I am close friends with the royal family member Zhu Xuanji of the Southern Bean Kingdom. He tends to award me an official position."<br/>
<br/>
"I am self-aware; my cultivation is only at the early stage of foundation Establishment, and I need much more practice. It's currently difficult to achieve a great undertaking."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, I am following the three generals, hoping to leverage your powers to participate in battle and see if there’s an opportunity for my clan to take revenge on the Six Caves Sect!"<br/>
<br/>
"Afterward, I also need to carry precious materials and reach a trade deal with some major force to fulfill my clan’s mission."<br/>
<br/>
"And further on, I want to travel to more places to broaden my horizons."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei squinted: "Zhu Xuanji of the Southern Bean Kingdom? He is a renowned Detective. I've heard of him."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei looked at Ning Zhuo again. He didn’t expect the Foundation Establishment cultivator before him to have close ties to a famous person.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s regret deepened upon hearing this.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo possessed precious materials, was very wealthy, and had a unique grasp of earth techniques; although he was only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment, his combat power was outstanding.<br/>
<br/>
Now hearing of Ning Zhuo's strong connections, even Zhu Xuanji looked favorably upon him!<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er's inquiries were to draw Ning Zhuo in, use the Ning family for his own purposes. Yet, Ning Zhuo’s words made him realize the young cultivator before him could not be underestimated. He was a young master of the Ning family with deep connections to the royal family of the Southern Bean Kingdom, possessing a significant background —someone like him could not easily be won over.<br/>
<br/>
“At least, I can’t win him over right now!” Liu Er gritted his teeth secretly, feeling his thirst for fame and fortune intensifying.<br/>
<br/>
In the evening.<br/>
<br/>
A troop slowly entered the Celestial City of Green Forest.<br/>
<br/>
The rays of the setting sun illuminated their golden armor, further enhancing their nobility and majesty.<br/>
<br/>
Golden Halberd Army!<br/>
<br/>
One of the two forbidden military forces of the two nations formally arrived at the City of Green Forest.<br/>
<br/>
Although this news had already spread throughout the city, seeing such a disciplined army in person made the citizens solemn, and they couldn’t help but exclaim in their hearts: Such a strong army!<br/>
<br/>
The military flag fluttered, rustling in the evening wind.<br/>
<br/>
The whole army rode horses, the sound of hooves heavy and powerful.<br/>
<br/>
Every soldier held a golden long halberd, upright towards the sky, forming a forest of weapons, emitting an endless sharp aura.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan, as the commander of the Golden Halberd Army, rode at the front of the formation.<br/>
<br/>
His face was cold, eyes sharp as blades, sweeping around, making the citizens instinctively avert their gazes, not daring to make eye contact.<br/>
<br/>
In stark contrast to him was a diplomat of the two nations.<br/>
<br/>
Although he also rode a fine horse and sat upright, his demeanor was incompatible with that of the Golden Halberd Army, clearly an outsider.<br/>
<br/>
But no one dared to underestimate this official.<br/>
<br/>
For the clothes he wore and the staff he held indicated his identity—an imperial envoy!<br/>
<br/>
Unlike other armies, the Golden Halberd Army had the fewest numbers yet was the most loyal and reliable, hence they did not camp outside the city but directly settled inside Celestial City of Green Forest.<br/>
<br/>
The city lord had long arranged accommodations, proactively welcoming Sun Gan and the envoy, enthusiastically inviting them to join the evening banquet.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan's face was as hard as iron; he stated that he must first settle the army before considering attending the banquet.<br/>
<br/>
The envoy laughed heartily, asking for the banquet to include the heads of several armies so he could bond with these colleagues.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan chuckled coldly upon hearing this.<br/>
<br/>
It was because this envoy, named Zhao Yuan, was notoriously greedy. Every time he traveled, he used his power to solicit bribes.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan found it reprehensible, yet Zhao Yuan was trusted by the upper echelons of the two nations, often dispatched on various missions no matter how many complaints were lodged.<br/>
<br/>
The banquet was quite lavish, filled with the local specialties of Celestial City of Green Forest.<br/>
<br/>
The banquet had both an inner and outer hall.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo Little Friend?" In the outer hall, Zhang Zhongyi was surprised to see Ning Zhuo step in.<br/>
<br/>
As the military advisor, Ning Zhuo was considered a senior figure in an army.<br/>
<br/>
This was the advantage of joining the Three Generals Battalion; positions were open in the early stages, and with a small contribution, one could attain high rank.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Zhang Zhongyi, Ning Zhuo was also delighted. After chatting, he sat directly to Zhang Zhongyi’s left.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not conceal his status or the necessity of doing so.<br/>
<br/>
"You joined the Three Generals Battalion and even became their military advisor?" Zhang Zhongyi exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
Though he held a high reputation, he was merely a military doctor, unable to participate in the decision-making of the Red Flower Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
From this perspective, Ning Zhuo’s status was already higher than his.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quietly informed Zhang Zhongyi that it was by coincidence that he heard Liu, Guan, and Zhang discussing the organization of a new army. He took the initiative to express his desire to join.<br/>
<br/>
For this, he even presented the three generals with three pieces of precious materials: the Xuan Huang Mother Stone, Blood Bamboo Stone, and Nether Black Pond.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi immediately examined Ning Zhuo, astonished by the financial power of this Foundation Establishment cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Being able to present such precious materials proved Ning Zhuo had at least a few more!<br/>
<br/>
"Unfortunately, Mulan did not heed my advice. If she had recruited Ning Zhuo, how wonderful would that be."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh!"<br/>
<br/>
"Her bow needs replacement; otherwise, she cannot fully utilize her exceptional archery skills. If only we had some Nascent Soul level materials..."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi shook his head continuously in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
The night banquet began.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Zhang Zhongyi chatted while dining, frequently toasting the people at the same table.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the door to the inner hall was pushed open.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan stormed out in a huff.<br/>
<br/>
"Zhao Yuan, you are the notorious worm of our two nations!" Mulan shouted angrily, scanning the room until her gaze landed on Zhang Zhongyi.<br/>
<br/>
She also noticed Ning Zhuo, her gaze lingering on him for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan then said: "Zhang, let’s go. This banquet may be nice, but the small-mindedness of the people at the table truly disgusts me!"<br/>
<br/>
Under the attention of many, Zhang Zhongyi immediately stood up, his face displaying anger: "General, old man follows closely."<br/>
<br/>
Though Zhang Zhongyi sighed inwardly, anticipating this situation, now was not the time to persuade Mulan. He left the table immediately to display unity.<br/>
<br/>
The night banquet had not yet begun for long before Mulan and Zhang Zhongyi furiously departed.<br/>
<br/>
"Come on, continue eating and drinking!" Zhao Si loudly encouraged, attempting to liven the atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
He was incredibly thick-skinned, almost shameless, seemingly oblivious to Mulan’s criticism of him.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Jing, Xu Dali, and others quickly raised their cups.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was among them, but only sported a bitter smile. Zhao Yuan’s earlier mention of "travel compensation" was simply extortionate.<br/>
<br/>
At another table in the inner hall, Zhang Hei raised his head, pouring more wine down his throat.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong sat upright, stroking his long beard, keeping a keen eye on the main table's discussions, his eyes flashing with cold light.<br/>
<br/>
As the feast ended, the group of four walked home, and Liu Er looked up at the bright moon in the night sky, sighing deeply.<br/>
<br/>
"Why does the elder brother look so upset?" Zhang Hei asked, yawning and staggering from drunkenness.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong snorted coldly and recounted the events.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei exclaimed: "That envoy dares to openly solicit bribes? How outrageous! Is the two-nation regime really this corrupt?"<br/>
<br/>
"If we succeed in our future endeavors, will we also be treated harshly?"<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er waved his hand: "That won’t happen. The recruitment order issued personally by the monarch of the two nations concerns him, the royal family, and the prestige of the two nations. In this respect, they will definitely strive for fairness."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er feared Zhang Hei would hold a grudge, as he wanted to achieve great things in the two nations.<br/>
<br/>
Among all the surrounding cultivation nations, only the two nations opened such opportunities for someone like him, a mixed-blood human-demon.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei grumbled: "That's good!"<br/>
<br/>
"I felt from the first sight that this dog envoy was looking at people with a slant eye; he’s clearly not a good person."<br/>
<br/>
"Why should we care about him?"<br/>
<br/>
"Although he is an envoy, he is not our direct superior. If we can avoid a confrontation with him, that itself is a good outcome. He even wants our money?"<br/>
<br/>
"That's simply unacceptable!"<br/>
<br/>
"Our money is already stretched thin; it's meant for forming an army."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er could only sigh deeply.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "Gentlemen, don’t worry. I will handle the envoy's matters."<br/>
<br/>
"Based on my silver tongue, I will make him understand that the honor of the three generals cannot be insulted by mere wealth."<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er then looked to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gave Liu Er a meaningful smile.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was momentarily startled, then ordered Ning Zhuo to represent him and manage this matter.<br/>
<br/>
"There's no time to lose; I'll return to clarify matters with that envoy," Ning Zhuo said.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei wanted to support Ning Zhuo: "The military advisor's cultivation is merely Foundation Establishment; how can he face that Golden Dan envoy? It's better for me to accompany you to increase our stature."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, politely refusing.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er took the initiative to grasp Zhang Hei's shoulder, expressing his full confidence in Ning Zhuo, asserting that doubting Ning Zhuo’s ability was underestimating our younger brother.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei was momentarily dazed by this remark and had to watch Ning Zhuo head back.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was all smiles, and envoy Zhao Si was also smiling broadly.<br/>
<br/>
He was brightly lit as he continually thumbed through the precious materials in his hands, sounding off loudly.<br/>
<br/>
"The three generals of the Garrison Battalion are indeed remarkable!<br/>
<br/>
"Those who recognize the times are wise!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took out another precious material.<br/>
<br/>
"I have a close relationship with Lord Zhang Zhongyi and aim to rely on him to help my friend."<br/>
<br/>
"I also ask you, My Lord, to go easy on the Red Flower Battalion."<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Yuan cast a deep glance at Ning Zhuo: "Kid, some matters are not for a foreigner like you from the Southern Bean Kingdom to meddle in."<br/>
<br/>
"The troubles of General Mulan are far greater than you imagined."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled: "I understand."<br/>
<br/>
As he spoke, he took out a Nascent Soul precious material and placed it on the table: "If there’s a big problem, naturally I will trouble you further. Adding another precious material is completely reasonable!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Yuan's eyes widened, deeply shaken by Ning Zhuo's display of wealth.<br/>
<br/>
"The Ning family Fire Persimmon Immortal City must be a great clan!"<br/>
<br/>
"Why did they only pass through the two nations and not settle down? They migrated to the Southern Bean Kingdom?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Yuan thought of this and felt a sense of regret.<br/>
<br/>
"How many precious materials does this kid still have? Since he likes to meddle in other affairs..." This greedy thought just surfaced when he quickly dismissed it.<br/>
<br/>
Life and death hung by a thread!<br/>
<br/>
The Buddhist Heart Demon's Seal!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo maintained a gentle smile, but was continuously upholding these two measures.<br/>
<br/>
"Lord Zhao, I helped the Red Flower Battalion just to make a good impression on Lord Zhang Zhongyi."<br/>
<br/>
"If possible, please grant me a small convenience."<br/>
<br/>
"I would never put you in a difficult position; I just need some cooperation from you..."<br/>
<br/>
Influenced discreetly, Zhao Yuan nodded immediately upon hearing Ning Zhuo’s specific request: "Who made me look fondly upon this kid? Rest assured, I agree."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo once again indicated that after the matter was accomplished, he would offer a small token of appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Yuan nodded repeatedly: "The Ning family’s education must be deep-rooted, with such values. It indeed makes us admire."<br/>
<br/>
The next day.<br/>
<br/>
Military supplies were distributed, but the Red Flower Battalion had yet to receive theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Mulan, furious, made a scene, but the cultivator responsible for logistics had already prepared a perfect excuse, deliberately continuing to delay distribution.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi sighed immediately upon hearing this, knowing it was Zhao Si’s doing.<br/>
<br/>
Just then, Ning Zhuo came to visit. Upon seeing Zhang Zhongyi’s furrowed brow, he inquired about the reason.<br/>
<br/>
After learning of the situation, Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and told Zhang Zhongyi: Previously, he represented the Three Generals Battalion in delivering goods, which had pleased Zhao Yuan. Perhaps today, they might visit again, allowing the envoy to lift his hand on this occasion and let him cover the difference.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, Ning Zhuo returned after handling the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi changed his previous demeanor, took Ning Zhuo's hand, and expressed deep gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
"Mulan is strong-willed, resembling her father. If I were to act, she would resent me, further creating a rift. I was caught in a dilemma until Ning Zhuo took action."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo responded: "I also have a personal stake in this, Lord Zhang; I want to help my friend."<br/>
<br/>
"Well said, well said!" Zhang Zhongyi waved dismissively, "This time, I’ll waive all consultation fees."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo clapped the traveling dragon box at his waist, releasing Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, even Sun Ling Tong's little butt turned to stone.<br/>
<br/>
He, however, was not in a hurry, still laughing nonchalantly.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi skeptically remarked: "To save the little one, we still need a Master of Earth Techniques; you haven’t forgotten that, right?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cupped his hands towards Zhang Zhongyi and slightly bowed: "Lord Zhang, don’t take offense; I myself am the Master of Earth Techniques."<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Zhongyi raised an eyebrow, looking incredulously at the white-clad youth before him: "You?!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood upright, arms relaxed, wearing a smile: "No fake, guaranteed." <br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: "Hehe! Little Ning, Dr. Zhang, please act swiftly; I can hardly wait!"</div>
