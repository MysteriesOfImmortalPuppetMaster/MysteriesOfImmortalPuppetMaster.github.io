<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
Flames, frost, rolling logs, golden blades, and giant stones continuously attacked Meng Chong, each representing one of the Five Elements.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong's eyes flashed with a sharp light.<br/>
<br/>
He executed his innate talent, WildSprint Thunderclap, moving with the speed of lightning, weaving through the gaps between the spells.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't until the final layer of spells that his shoulder was grazed by a golden blade.<br/>
<br/>
The subordinates responsible for sparring training congratulated him repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong had made significant progress.<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha," Meng Chong laughed heartily, "If I undergo ten more sessions of such training, I won't fear the attacks of those spell puppets when I break through the next checkpoint." Meng Chong took a temporary rest, and the Meng family's servants immediately presented meticulously prepared refreshments, all of which were spirit foods.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong ate and drank a few bites, then heard the latest intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
"What?" He raised his eyebrows slightly.<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui entered the Immortal Palace three times today, each time intercepted by mechanical apes, suffering miserable defeats and failing to even reach the preparation room. How is she so unlucky?"<br/>
<br/>
"Why do I rarely encounter that mechanical ape anymore?" Meng Chong was fixated on the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he had fought Yuan Dasheng many times and always lost, harboring a grudge and a strong desire to redeem himself.<br/>
<br/>
However, under Ning Zhuo's arrangement and command, Yuan Dasheng rarely intercepted Meng Chong anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, when Meng Chong was in the heat of battle, Yuan Dasheng would burst in and launch sneak attacks, often with great success.<br/>
<br/>
This infuriated Meng Chong even more.<br/>
<br/>
Initially, he cursed loudly, but later, perhaps realizing that the mechanical ape couldn't understand human language, he chose to keep silent.<br/>
<br/>
For Ning Xiaohui, Yuan Dasheng had become a nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
For Meng Chong, however, he was a coveted opponent.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Family.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical Trap Training Room.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian walked on the wooden floor.<br/>
<br/>
His gaze was calm, emitting a chill, and his steps were slow.<br/>
<br/>
With each step, he lifted his leg high and lowered it slowly.<br/>
<br/>
During the descent, his innate talent, Heart-Piercing Insight, frequently activated, guiding him.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian walked from start to finish without triggering any of the traps beneath the floor.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of training had been conducted many times.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian had gained a deeper understanding of his innate talent, achieving significant results.<br/>
<br/>
However, what impressed Zheng Jian the most was the Ning family's talisman.<br/>
<br/>
"This Ice Heart Talisman really suits me."<br/>
<br/>
"Using this talisman, I can enter an absolutely calm state. My Heart-Piercing Insight almost always activates!"<br/>
<br/>
"Unfortunately, the Ice Heart Talisman can only be refined by cultivators who specialize in the Ice Heart Technique."<br/>
<br/>
"The Ice Heart Technique is a core technique of the Ning family, and talismans related to it rarely circulate in the market. I only got this opportunity thanks to the alliance of the three families."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh..."<br/>
<br/>
Jian Family.<br/>
<br/>
Underground Martial Arena.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zesheng were preparing for a sparring match.<br/>
<br/>
Both took out medicine pouches, which contained a pile of silver-gray powder.<br/>
<br/>
They tilted their heads back, opened their mouths wide, and poured the silver-gray powder directly into their mouths.<br/>
<br/>
This was the Mind-Splitting Powder.<br/>
<br/>
The medicine quickly took effect, causing slight changes in the faces of these two Qi Refining geniuses of the Zhou family.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's fight!" Zhou Zesheng shouted in a low voice.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu responded with a muffled grunt.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zesheng initiated the attack with a spell.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu, after a brief pause, took out a mechanical war hammer.<br/>
<br/>
Mud Gate Earth Hammer!<br/>
<br/>
The war hammer was almost as tall as Zhou Zhu himself, and very heavy.<br/>
<br/>
Wielding it with just his personal strength was quite strenuous.<br/>
<br/>
The hammer's surface had multiple round holes, from which fierce air currents spouted.<br/>
<br/>
The air currents propelled the hammer, assisting Zhou Zhu in attacking Zhou Zesheng.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zesheng dared not confront its fierce light head-on and kept retreating.<br/>
<br/>
While retreating, he opened his storage bag, releasing a swarm of mechanical bats.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical‚ÄîNight Sky Bats.<br/>
<br/>
A large group of mechanical bats flew in the air, spewing thick black fog along the way.<br/>
<br/>
The black fog filled the battlefield, obscuring Zhou Zhu's vision.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu tried several methods but couldn't disperse the black fog, so he decisively patted his storage belt.<br/>
<br/>
From the belt emerged a large number of mechanical mice.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical‚ÄîGround Drilling Mice.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical mice landed on the ground and, under Zhou Zhu's control, cast their inherent spell‚ÄîMud Transformation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
The solid ground immediately turned into a swamp.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu swung the hammer forcefully, splashing countless clods of yellow mud.<br/>
<br/>
The hammer embedded deeply into the swampy mud, and suddenly, several round holes spouted air currents simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
The hammer plunged into the mud, dragging Zhou Zhu along.<br/>
<br/>
Many Night Sky Bats lost their primary target and, under Zhou Zesheng's command, continuously descended into the swamp to capture the Ground Drilling Mice.<br/>
<br/>
The Ground Drilling Mice defended themselves in the swamp.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever a Night Sky Bat missed, the spiral drill at the front of the Ground Drilling Mice would pierce through the thin bodies of the bats.<br/>
<br/>
If a Night Sky Bat caught a Ground Drilling Mouse, its inherent spell would immediately seal the mouse, greatly hindering its spiritual power.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zesheng were locked in a stalemate until both the Ground Drilling Mice and Night Sky Bats were nearly exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
They then tacitly stopped fighting.<br/>
<br/>
As the black fog dissipated, both sat down and took out Multi-Heart Pills.<br/>
<br/>
They immediately consumed the Multi-Heart Pills to consolidate the results of their training.<br/>
<br/>
After a long time, Zhou Zesheng was the first to open his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few breaths later, Zhou Zhu also opened his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
With a hint of joy, Zhou Zesheng sighed, "The combination of Mind-Splitting Powder and Multi-Heart Pills is indeed effective, allowing us to master deeper levels of multitasking and control more mechanical constructs."<br/>
<br/>
"If we continue training like this, we might be able to control thirty mechanical bats and mice simultaneously."<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu, rarely speaking in long sentences, said, "Mana is too scarce. Longer combat durations would yield better results."<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zesheng sighed, "There's nothing we can do. We haven't found the subsequent techniques yet. Fortunately, everyone is at the third level of Qi Refining, equally weak."<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu asked, "Is there really a subsequent technique in the Lava Immortal Palace?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zesheng replied, "Judging by the current trend, it's more likely. We just need to keep an eye on Meng Chong. He has the highest progress. If his cultivation breaks through to the fourth level, then the Lava Immortal Palace must have the subsequent techniques."<br/>
<br/>
At this point, the reformation teams of the four factions generally had reached the peak of the third level of Qi Refining.<br/>
<br/>
Without subsequent techniques, they could only remain stagnant.<br/>
<br/>
Only the geniuses of each family could still make progress by training their innate talents.<br/>
<br/>
Others mostly chose to study and research mechanical techniques to become stronger.<br/>
<br/>
Progress was made, but it wasn't significant.<br/>
<br/>
Even Meng Chong had entered a relatively stable bottleneck period.<br/>
<br/>
Wrapped in floating clouds, Ning Zhuo silently cultivated, continuing to refine his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
The Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact was pressed against his chest, slowly rotating.<br/>
<br/>
In Ning Zhuo's middle dantian, a tornado was stirring.<br/>
<br/>
Ineffective mana was drawn into the tornado, where it was ground and reduced.<br/>
<br/>
This was a form of purification.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's mana, cultivated through shortcuts like the Ice Jade Wine, was impure.<br/>
<br/>
But now, through this process, the quality of his mana would significantly improve.<br/>
<br/>
Pure mana was crucial, as the purer it was, the more positive the impact on all aspects, giving the cultivator greater advantages.<br/>
<br/>
The Pure Yang Body, an innate talent, allowed mana to naturally carry pure yang energy, free of impurities.<br/>
<br/>
Among the seven great flames, the Glazed Pure Fire was highly sought after because it could burn away impurities, purifying a cultivator's divine sense, mana, and blood.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators universally pursued pure mana relentlessly.<br/>
<br/>
"The Tornado Windmill's purification ability is secondary; its main function is to speed up mana refinement."<br/>
<br/>
"If there were a specialized purification Magical Artifact, it would be even better."<br/>
<br/>
After one round of purification, Ning Zhuo's original ten parts of mana were reduced to less than six parts, a significant difference.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued to absorb spiritual energy, refining it into Five Elements Mana.<br/>
<br/>
After two or three rounds, he replenished the purified mana to ten parts.<br/>
<br/>
He paused his dantian cultivation to let the purified mana nourish his middle dantian.<br/>
<br/>
He then began his essence cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
The source of essence refinement was his physical body.<br/>
<br/>
The physical body's condition was influenced mainly by abundant spirit food and pills.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo never skimped on his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, he had taken one each of the Marrow Cleansing Pill and Detoxification Pill.<br/>
<br/>
These pills were bestowed by the main lineage of the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, after thorough examination by Sun Lingtong and careful testing by Ning Zhuo himself, he confirmed their effects.<br/>
<br/>
The Marrow Cleansing Pill slightly improved his physique, while the Detoxification Pill mainly removed accumulated toxins from his body.<br/>
<br/>
The effects were not very noticeable.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, pills like the Marrow Cleansing Pill required long-term and large-scale consumption to yield gradual results.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had just started taking them.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Ning Zhuo primarily relied on spirit food, with pills as a supplement, so he hadn't accumulated much pill toxicity.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, today's essence cultivation ended.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo began practicing spells.<br/>
<br/>
He took out the Five Elements Ruler, held it in his hand, and silently channeled his Five Elements Mana, casting the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique.<br/>
<br/>
The floating clouds churned, barely concealing Ning Zhuo's spell fluctuations.<br/>
<br/>
The Five Elements Ruler allowed the Five Elements Mana to quickly separate, assisting Ning Zhuo in practicing spells, which had a positive effect.<br/>
<br/>
"Complex."<br/>
<br/>
"This spell is too complex, the most intricate I've ever encountered!"<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, if only there were corresponding rewards on the ranking list."<br/>
<br/>
"Maybe the subsequent levels of the Immortal Palace will have them?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had just begun practicing this technique, with a long way to go.<br/>
<br/>
After practicing for a while, Ning Zhuo took out two Enlightenment Diagrams, the Frost Enlightenment Diagram and the Proud Snow Enlightenment Diagram.<br/>
<br/>
He stared at them for a long time, then touched his forehead, still clueless.<br/>
<br/>
"No worries."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took out an Enlightenment Pill and immediately consumed it.<br/>
<br/>
He then looked at the two Enlightenment Diagrams, his gaze unwavering.<br/>
<br/>
His thoughts gradually dispersed, and Ning Zhuo didn't restrain them, letting them spread.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo began to gradually feel the subtle sensations brought by the Enlightenment Diagrams.<br/>
<br/>
This feeling was unprecedented.<br/>
<br/>
However, the insights from the Enlightenment Diagrams were faint.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, the various mechanical blueprints and the mechanical classics left by his mother became vividly clear in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the various techniques and spells he had acquired in the Lava Immortal Palace also became prominent.<br/>
<br/>
"Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra!"<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the entire scripture of the Fire Burial Sutra appeared clearly in Ning Zhuo's mind, word for word.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo suddenly had a new understanding of this scripture.<br/>
<br/>
He beamed with joy, "So this scripture has a deeper interpretation."<br/>
<br/>
"Wonderful!"<br/>
<br/>
"Now, I can refine spiritual mechanical constructs on my own."<br/>
<br/>
It was a case of planting flowers intentionally but not blooming, while unintentionally planting willows that thrived.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo never expected that while using the Enlightenment Pill to comprehend the Enlightenment Diagrams, he would gain new insights into the Fire Burial Sutra.</div>
