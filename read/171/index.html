<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 171: Ning Zhuo's Enlightenment</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Flames, frost, rolling logs, golden blades, and giant stones continuously attacked Meng Chong, each representing one of the Five Elements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Meng Chong's eyes flashed with a sharp light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He executed his innate talent, WildSprint Thunderclap, moving with the speed of lightning, weaving through the gaps between the spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">It wasn't until the final layer of spells that his shoulder was grazed by a golden blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The subordinates responsible for sparring training congratulated him repeatedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Meng Chong had made significant progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Hahaha," Meng Chong laughed heartily, "If I undergo ten more sessions of such training, I won't fear the attacks of those spell puppets when I break through the next checkpoint." Meng Chong took a temporary rest, and the Meng family's servants immediately presented meticulously prepared refreshments, all of which were spirit foods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Meng Chong ate and drank a few bites, then heard the latest intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"What?" He raised his eyebrows slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Ning Xiaohui entered the Immortal Palace three times today, each time intercepted by mechanical apes, suffering miserable defeats and failing to even reach the preparation room. How is she so unlucky?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Why do I rarely encounter that mechanical ape anymore?" Meng Chong was fixated on the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After all, he had fought Yuan Dasheng many times and always lost, harboring a grudge and a strong desire to redeem himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">However, under Ning Zhuo's arrangement and command, Yuan Dasheng rarely intercepted Meng Chong anymore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Occasionally, when Meng Chong was in the heat of battle, Yuan Dasheng would burst in and launch sneak attacks, often with great success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This infuriated Meng Chong even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Initially, he cursed loudly, but later, perhaps realizing that the mechanical ape couldn't understand human language, he chose to keep silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">For Ning Xiaohui, Yuan Dasheng had become a nightmare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">For Meng Chong, however, he was a coveted opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zheng Family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Mechanical Trap Training Room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zheng Jian walked on the wooden floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">His gaze was calm, emitting a chill, and his steps were slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">With each step, he lifted his leg high and lowered it slowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">During the descent, his innate talent, Heart-Piercing Insight, frequently activated, guiding him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Zheng Jian walked from start to finish without triggering any of the traps beneath the floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">This kind of training had been conducted many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zheng Jian had gained a deeper understanding of his innate talent, achieving significant results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">However, what impressed Zheng Jian the most was the Ning family's talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"This Ice Heart Talisman really suits me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Using this talisman, I can enter an absolutely calm state. My Heart-Piercing Insight almost always activates!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Unfortunately, the Ice Heart Talisman can only be refined by cultivators who specialize in the Ice Heart Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"The Ice Heart Technique is a core technique of the Ning family, and talismans related to it rarely circulate in the market. I only got this opportunity thanks to the alliance of the three families."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Sigh..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Jian Family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Underground Martial Arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zesheng were preparing for a sparring match.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Both took out medicine pouches, which contained a pile of silver-gray powder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">They tilted their heads back, opened their mouths wide, and poured the silver-gray powder directly into their mouths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">This was the Mind-Splitting Powder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The medicine quickly took effect, causing slight changes in the faces of these two Qi Refining geniuses of the Zhou family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Let's fight!" Zhou Zesheng shouted in a low voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhou Zhu responded with a muffled grunt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhou Zesheng initiated the attack with a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Zhou Zhu, after a brief pause, took out a mechanical war hammer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Mud Gate Earth Hammer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The war hammer was almost as tall as Zhou Zhu himself, and very heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Wielding it with just his personal strength was quite strenuous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The hammer's surface had multiple round holes, from which fierce air currents spouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The air currents propelled the hammer, assisting Zhou Zhu in attacking Zhou Zesheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Zhou Zesheng dared not confront its fierce light head-on and kept retreating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">While retreating, he opened his storage bag, releasing a swarm of mechanical bats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Mechanical - Night Sky Bats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">A large group of mechanical bats flew in the air, spewing thick black fog along the way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The black fog filled the battlefield, obscuring Zhou Zhu's vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhou Zhu tried several methods but couldn't disperse the black fog, so he decisively patted his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">From the belt emerged a large number of mechanical mice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Mechanical - Ground Drilling Mice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The mechanical mice landed on the ground and, under Zhou Zhu's control, cast their inherent spell - Mud Transformation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The solid ground immediately turned into a swamp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Zhou Zhu swung the hammer forcefully, splashing countless clods of yellow mud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The hammer embedded deeply into the swampy mud, and suddenly, several round holes spouted air currents simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The hammer plunged into the mud, dragging Zhou Zhu along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Many Night Sky Bats lost their primary target and, under Zhou Zesheng's command, continuously descended into the swamp to capture the Ground Drilling Mice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Ground Drilling Mice defended themselves in the swamp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Whenever a Night Sky Bat missed, the spiral drill at the front of the Ground Drilling Mice would pierce through the thin bodies of the bats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">If a Night Sky Bat caught a Ground Drilling Mouse, its inherent spell would immediately seal the mouse, greatly hindering its spiritual power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zesheng were locked in a stalemate until both the Ground Drilling Mice and Night Sky Bats were nearly exhausted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">They then tacitly stopped fighting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">As the black fog dissipated, both sat down and took out Multi-Heart Pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">They immediately consumed the Multi-Heart Pills to consolidate the results of their training.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">After a long time, Zhou Zesheng was the first to open his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Just a few breaths later, Zhou Zhu also opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">With a hint of joy, Zhou Zesheng sighed, "The combination of Mind-Splitting Powder and Multi-Heart Pills is indeed effective, allowing us to master deeper levels of multitasking and control more mechanical constructs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"If we continue training like this, we might be able to control thirty mechanical bats and mice simultaneously."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Zhou Zhu, rarely speaking in long sentences, said, "Mana is too scarce. Longer combat durations would yield better results."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Zhou Zesheng sighed, "There's nothing we can do. We haven't found the subsequent techniques yet. Fortunately, everyone is at the third level of Qi Refining, equally weak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Zhou Zhu asked, "Is there really a subsequent technique in the Lava Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zhou Zesheng replied, "Judging by the current trend, it's more likely. We just need to keep an eye on Meng Chong. He has the highest progress. If his cultivation breaks through to the fourth level, then the Lava Immortal Palace must have the subsequent techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">At this point, the reformation teams of the four factions generally had reached the peak of the third level of Qi Refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Without subsequent techniques, they could only remain stagnant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Only the geniuses of each family could still make progress by training their innate talents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Others mostly chose to study and research mechanical techniques to become stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Progress was made, but it wasn't significant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Even Meng Chong had entered a relatively stable bottleneck period.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Wrapped in floating clouds, Ning Zhuo silently cultivated, continuing to refine his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact was pressed against his chest, slowly rotating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">In Ning Zhuo's middle dantian, a tornado was stirring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ineffective mana was drawn into the tornado, where it was ground and reduced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">This was a form of purification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo's mana, cultivated through shortcuts like the Ice Jade Wine, was impure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">But now, through this process, the quality of his mana would significantly improve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Pure mana was crucial, as the purer it was, the more positive the impact on all aspects, giving the cultivator greater advantages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Pure Yang Body, an innate talent, allowed mana to naturally carry pure yang energy, free of impurities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Among the seven great flames, the Glazed Pure Fire was highly sought after because it could burn away impurities, purifying a cultivator's divine sense, mana, and blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Cultivators universally pursued pure mana relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"The Tornado Windmill's purification ability is secondary; its main function is to speed up mana refinement."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"If there were a specialized purification Magical Artifact, it would be even better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">After one round of purification, Ning Zhuo's original ten parts of mana were reduced to less than six parts, a significant difference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo continued to absorb spiritual energy, refining it into Five Elements Mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">After two or three rounds, he replenished the purified mana to ten parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He paused his dantian cultivation to let the purified mana nourish his middle dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He then began his essence cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The source of essence refinement was his physical body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The physical body's condition was influenced mainly by abundant spirit food and pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo never skimped on his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">In addition, he had taken one each of the Marrow Cleansing Pill and Detoxification Pill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">These pills were bestowed by the main lineage of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Recently, after thorough examination by Sun Lingtong and careful testing by Ning Zhuo himself, he confirmed their effects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Marrow Cleansing Pill slightly improved his physique, while the Detoxification Pill mainly removed accumulated toxins from his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The effects were not very noticeable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">On one hand, pills like the Marrow Cleansing Pill required long-term and large-scale consumption to yield gradual results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Ning Zhuo had just started taking them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">On the other hand, Ning Zhuo primarily relied on spirit food, with pills as a supplement, so he hadn't accumulated much pill toxicity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Soon, today's essence cultivation ended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo began practicing spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">He took out the Five Elements Ruler, held it in his hand, and silently channeled his Five Elements Mana, casting the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The floating clouds churned, barely concealing Ning Zhuo's spell fluctuations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The Five Elements Ruler allowed the Five Elements Mana to quickly separate, assisting Ning Zhuo in practicing spells, which had a positive effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Complex."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"This spell is too complex, the most intricate I've ever encountered!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Sigh, if only there were corresponding rewards on the ranking list."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Maybe the subsequent levels of the Immortal Palace will have them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo had just begun practicing this technique, with a long way to go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">After practicing for a while, Ning Zhuo took out two Enlightenment Diagrams, the Frost Enlightenment Diagram and the Proud Snow Enlightenment Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He stared at them for a long time, then touched his forehead, still clueless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"No worries."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo took out an Enlightenment Pill and immediately consumed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">He then looked at the two Enlightenment Diagrams, his gaze unwavering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">His thoughts gradually dispersed, and Ning Zhuo didn't restrain them, letting them spread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo began to gradually feel the subtle sensations brought by the Enlightenment Diagrams.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">This feeling was unprecedented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">However, the insights from the Enlightenment Diagrams were faint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Instead, the various mechanical blueprints and the mechanical classics left by his mother became vividly clear in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">In addition, the various techniques and spells he had acquired in the Lava Immortal Palace also became prominent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Dissolution Sutra!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">In the end, the entire scripture of the Fire Burial Sutra appeared clearly in Ning Zhuo's mind, word for word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ning Zhuo suddenly had a new understanding of this scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">He beamed with joy, "So this scripture has a deeper interpretation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"Wonderful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Now, I can refine spiritual mechanical constructs on my own."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">It was a case of planting flowers intentionally but not blooming, while unintentionally planting willows that thrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Ning Zhuo never expected that while using the Enlightenment Pill to comprehend the Enlightenment Diagrams, he would gain new insights into the Fire Burial Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
