<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">In the prison, the old scholar of the Ink Pool picked up a branding iron.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The front half of the branding iron was glowing red-hot from the charcoal brazier, and at its very tip was an engraved word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Upon closer inspection, Ning Zhuo saw that it was the word “Benevolence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The old scholar of the Ink Pool held this branding iron with the word “Benevolence” and walked up to the Silent Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Silent Ghost General was bound and unable to move, staring calmly at the old scholar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Without the slightest hesitation, the old scholar pressed the branding iron directly onto the Silent Ghost General’s forehead between his brows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sss...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The red-hot iron scorched the Ghost General’s brow, sending up thick black smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">For a moment, the scent of burning flesh filled the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The old scholar pressed the branding iron down for a full five breaths before slowly withdrawing it and returning it to the brazier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Silent Ghost General’s head drooped powerlessly, his breath now rough and heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Seeing Ning Zhuo’s surprise, Wen Ruanyu explained in time, “We Confucian cultivators uphold the Five Constants: Benevolence, Righteousness, Etiquette, Wisdom, and Trust.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Benevolence means to love others. It is the foundation of Confucianism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“If you desire to establish yourself, you must help others establish themselves; if you desire success, you must help others achieve success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“A person of benevolence has a generous heart, with integrity as steady as a mountain. They bestow favor and offer tolerance, accumulating good deeds as a foundation and treating all things with sincerity…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo listened attentively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Whether it was the old scholar Zheng Shoumo or the Myriad Manifestations true disciple Wen Ruanyu, both were Confucian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">To Ning Zhuo, Confucian cultivation was unfamiliar, so hearing such detailed explanations from these masters made him perk up and learn eagerly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Seeing that the Silent Ghost General was only gasping heavily, the old scholar pulled out another branding iron from the brazier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This time, it bore a different word – “Righteousness”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Hiss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zheng Shoumo pressed the branding iron onto the Silent Ghost General’s left shoulder, creating another wave of scorched flesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The sharp pain caused the Silent Ghost General to suddenly raise his head and gaze at the ceiling, but his expression remained indifferent and his eyes calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Seeing this, the old scholar grew thoughtful. “Good, that gaze is not bad. I hope you can maintain this resolve for the next ones as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Wen Ruanyu explained again, “Righteousness, or properness, is the anchor of the righteous path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“A gentleman values righteousness above all and builds his conduct upon it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Righteousness does not lie in the body but in the heart. Even in times of adversity, one must uphold one’s integrity and not betray one’s original will…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“To act with righteousness is to follow justice, unmoved by personal gain; to embody uprightness with no distractions in the heart.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo silently committed these words to memory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The old scholar set down the Righteousness branding iron and took out a third one, bearing the word “Etiquette”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He repeated the process, branding the word onto the Silent Ghost General’s left shoulder blade. The Ghost General tightly shut his lips and clenched his teeth, still refusing to utter a sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The old scholar examined him from head to toe, sincerely praising, “As expected, a true man of steel.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Wen Ruanyu once more offered an explanation for Ning Zhuo, “Etiquette, or civility, is the code of conduct that humans must follow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“It’s said that etiquette is order, the structure of heaven and earth and the foundation of a state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Further, etiquette is the respect in one’s heart and the method by which one interacts with the world. To act with etiquette is to hold reverence in the heart, be graceful in manner, and retain a measure in all things…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Wen Ruanyu seemed to have studied this aspect the most deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He even added some of his own understanding: “Etiquette is not hypocrisy, but the unity of internal respect and external expression in accordance with natural law and human morals. Knowing when to advance and when to retreat, judging weight and lightness, discerning right and wrong…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo gained much from this and hastily cupped his hands in thanks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">He recalled the earlier scene at the Underworld Flood Dragon River when Wen Ruanyu engaged in battle. His mastery of etiquette had indeed been profound, causing many water ghosts and underworld soldiers to lay down their weapons and begin speaking of manners, surrendering themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“Benevolence, Righteousness, Etiquette, Wisdom, Trust... with Benevolence, Righteousness, and Etiquette already branded, only Wisdom and Trust remain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo recognized the pattern and had already noticed that many branding irons were stuck in the brazier, just with their tips buried too deep to see the words on them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The old scholar returned the branding iron to the brazier but did not immediately take out the fourth one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He turned to Wen Ruanyu and said, “Sir Wen, this enemy commander is truly the toughest man I’ve encountered in my life. I’ve branded him with three words, and he hasn’t so much as furrowed his brow or groaned in pain. I fear the remaining two words won’t get him to talk either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“I am ashamed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“I was boasting just a moment ago, but now I’m eating my words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“It was my mistake to underestimate the heroes of the world.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Wen Ruanyu frowned, “Then what now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The old scholar replied, “I still have a method. We can use this man’s fortitude to extract even more intelligence.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Moments later, the Green-Faced Ghost General, Bone Club Ghost General, Flower Life Ghost General, and Fang Tooth Ghost General were all brought into the cell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The old scholar said, “Your commander truly is a tough man. He didn’t let out a single sound even after being branded with three words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Watch closely. I hope you all can show the same resolve!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">With that, the old scholar pulled out the branding iron with the word Wisdom and pressed it hard onto the Silent Ghost General’s thigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Silent Ghost General trembled from the pain but still uttered nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Seeing this, the faces of the other four Ghost Generals changed drastically. Some struggled desperately, letting out muffled cries, but they were tightly bound and couldn’t move freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Wen Ruanyu once again explained to Ning Zhuo, this time through divine sense, “The wise are those who have knowledge and can put into practice that knowledge. Theirs is the wisdom of penetrating insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Knowing is not as good as liking, and liking is not as good as enjoying…"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“A wise person sees clearly, adapts to change, perceives the subtle, understands the big picture, is thoughtful in planning and decisive in action…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo silently nodded, pleased at all he was learning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Even the old scholar couldn’t help but give the Silent Ghost General a thumbs up. “Very good. You’re the toughest prisoner I’ve seen in my entire life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“I’ve never encountered someone who could endure all five words. I hope you can break that record.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Hiss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In the next moment, the branding iron with the character Trust was also pressed onto the Silent Ghost General’s right thigh, searing the word onto his flesh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Wen Ruanyu said, “Trust is ethos, the virtue of keeping one’s word and staying loyal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“To speak and act as promised, to honor one’s commitments, unwavering in loyalty, winning the hearts of all, and thereby embodying true virtue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“A gentleman focuses on the root, and once the root is established, the path emerges. Virtue is never alone; it always finds companions. Trust brings peace of mind to the people. A nation that is trustworthy wins the hearts of its citizens. It is both a moral pinnacle and the foundation of personal integrity.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">As he finished explaining, the Silent Ghost General finally reached his limit. His eyes closed, and he fainted on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“What a pity, what a pity.” The old scholar shook his head in sincere regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He turned and unbound the Green-Faced Ghost General, allowing him to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">With a gentle and refined tone, the old scholar said, “I recall that you once received a branding, but fainted halfway through the first word. I hope you’ll do better this time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The Green-Faced Ghost General, a hardened veteran of countless battles and a ghostly creature who licked blood from his blade, struggled even more violently at these words, shouting, “I already told you everything! I’ve confessed all I know!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The old Confucian scholar of the Ink Pool nodded and smiled. "In a moment, we’ll summon Madam City Lord’s Soul Inquiry Scroll. I hope your words are true."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The old scholar resealed the bindings on the Green-Faced Ghost General, then successively released the restraints on the remaining three generals so they could speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The three generals had all witnessed with their own eyes how Silent Ghost General had collapsed in unconsciousness, and they had each experienced the pain of the branding iron. This kind of pain was not merely skin-deep but reached into the depths of the soul, a truly soul-searing, unbearable agony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">This time, when the old scholar interrogated them one by one, they all confessed military intelligence they had previously withheld. Their attitudes became considerably more proper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Only when it came to Flower Life Ghost General did this ghost general stammer out tremblingly, "Sirs, Sir Silent didn’t truly resist to the end. He had long desired to return to the light. It’s just that his innate talent and cultivation technique made his expression remain calm and prevented him from speaking."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The old scholar of the Ink Pool: ......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu: ......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The silence grew a little awkward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">With a wave of his hand, Mo Chi ordered the remaining four generals to be taken away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He cupped his hands toward Wen Ruanyu, requesting permission to cast a spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Wen Ruanyu did not hesitate and nodded in approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Thus, in the next instant, Mo Chi activated a Confucian spell - Amnesty and Alliance Policy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The old scholar stirred his spiritual energy, rapidly depleting it as he chanted softly under his breath, like reciting a beautiful literary piece.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Hand seals, oral seals, and heart seals - these were the main method through which spells were cast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">For a Confucian cultivator, oral seals were especially crucial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">As Mo Chi chanted, one by one, tiny silver-white words condensed from thin air and gathered together to form a refined and elegant passage of writing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">These silver-white words flowed like water toward Silent Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The five branded words on Silent Ghost General’s body were infused with the silver-white writing and began to emit a gentle white glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The glow rapidly spread from the five origins, converging across the surface of the Ghost General’s body into crisscrossing lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Upon closer inspection, each silver-white line was formed by minuscule words joined together. From a broader view, these lines looked like tightly bound restraints completely binding Silent Ghost General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The silver glow gradually faded until nothing remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">After more than ten breaths passed, the silver lines themselves also disappeared without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Finally, the five branded characters - Benevolence, Righteousness, Etiquette, Wisdom, and Trust - also faded away completely. To the naked eye, there was no difference from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Good. A complete success. Not bad at all." Wen Ruanyu clapped his hands and praised, "Old Brother Zheng’s insights into the Amnesty and Alliance Policy far surpass mine. If I had cast it, I certainly would not have achieved this level of effectiveness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo was slightly surprised. "Elder Zheng is in the late Foundation Establishment stage, while Senior Wen is a Golden Core stage cultivator. This can still happen?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Wen Ruanyu nodded. "Of course it can. Throughout the long river of history, we Confucian cultivators are late bloomers. The reason we managed to rise and secure a share of the world is because our cultivation method incorporates the hundred arts of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"For example, there are the traditional four scholarly arts - zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting - as well as the six gentlemanly disciplines of rites, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic. These allow us to cross stages of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"It is precisely because we blend these cultivation skills that Confucian cultivators are not judged solely by cultivation base. Sometimes, a Confucian cultivator deeply versed in the arts or classical texts can do things even those with a high cultivation base cannot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo thought of his own experience of using military strategy in battle to suddenly amplify his combat power, and he gained deeper understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The Silent Ghost General slowly regained consciousness, his expression still as indifferent as ever.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The old scholar of the Ink Pool directly released his bindings and restored his freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">This was a bold move, yet Wen Ruanyu showed no intention of stopping it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">As the Silent Ghost General studied the three of them, silver-white radiance shimmered on his body. He half-knelt on the ground and bowed to the three, expressing submission with the most direct action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Seeing this, Sun Lingtong could not help exclaiming, "This Amnesty and Alliance Policy is too effective, isn’t it? It’s about on par with your Life-Hanging Thread divine ability, Little Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"But divine abilities are incredibly hard to control. Whereas Amnesty and Alliance Policy is just a Confucian spell. Even an old man like this can learn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo, however, had a different opinion and privately replied, "There is still a difference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"My divine ability can forcibly control the enemy’s body and movements regardless of their will, and it works instantaneously."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"But the Amnesty and Alliance Policy requires extensive preliminary setup. Cultivating this spell must also have its own difficulties. Otherwise, Wen Ruanyu, a true disciple in the Golden Core stage, wouldn’t have deferred to a Foundation Establishment cultivator like Zheng Shoumo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"I really am growing more interested in Confucian cultivation. I hope to find time to learn more about it in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Sun Lingtong laughed, "Little Zhuo, is there any school or technique you’re not interested in?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo paused and replied, "Learning more is never a bad thing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Through this experience, the two of them expanded their horizons and realized that Confucian cultivators were quite different from what they had imagined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Silent Ghost General had been won over, but the other four generals couldn’t endure the branding. They could only be branded one word at a time with intervals in between. Thus, even though the Flower Life Ghost General had expressed their willingness to surrender, they were still imprisoned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">When Wen Ruanyu and the others questioned the Silent Ghost General, they did not gain any valuable leads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">In response, the old scholar of the Ink Pool analyzed, "Since they were sent into the inner city on a death mission, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord wouldn’t have entrusted them with important intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"In that sense, the Golden Core Ghost Generals dispatched here must have not been considered very valuable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"And precisely because of this, it is more likely that we can persuade them to surrender."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">As for the Silent Ghost General, Ning Zhuo secretly felt it was a pity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He had hoped to burn him and extract the spirituality of his innate talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">However, since he had already surrendered, his value to White Paper Immortal City was naturally greater for the time being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Right now, the ghost tide is still assaulting the city. A major battle is inevitable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"I’ll let Silent Ghost General continue making contributions. Once he eventually dies on the battlefield, I can take over then. There’s no need to rush."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">With no further leads, Ning Zhuo decisively suspended the investigation and remained in the Hidden Yang Manor to focus on cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">He used the four soul cultivation treasures one after another, causing his soul foundation to soar with each use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He broke through from Ten Thousand Man Soul to Hundred Thousand Man Soul, and then kept advancing from Hundred Thousand Man Soul without the slightest decrease in speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">On another front, Ning Zhuo also maintained his cultivation in the Three Schools Supreme Skills. Unfortunately, his progress in the Demonic Blood Vein Technique remained slow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo had the aptitude, and with the support of his Early Wisdom innate talent, his comprehension of Demonic Blood Vein Technique was already far beyond that of ordinary cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">But comparison was the thief of joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">From his perspective, his progress in understanding the Demonic Blood Vein Technique was simply too slow. It couldn’t compare at all to the cultivation of his physical body, and even his physical cultivation lagged far behind his soul cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Jiao Ma, Jiao Ma, your family has come to visit you." When Ning Zhuo’s soul foundation reached Three Hundred Thousand Man Soul, he received a message from a paper puppet servant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The visitor was the head of the Jiao Clan. Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, he immediately launched into a scolding tirade: "Ma'er, what are you doing? You still haven’t entered the Robust Yang Courtyard and are staying in Hidden Yang Manor?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Speak up!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"Are you still hung up on Qing Yan’s daughter?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
