<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Jin Yangzi flicked his sleeve and turned away proudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Only after he left the central courtyard did the male consorts break into heated whispers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“This Jin Yangzi fellow is truly insufferable!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Hmph, he’s nothing more than a demonic cultivator, naturally uncivilized. It’s beneath us to stoop to his level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Alas, we humans must endure humiliation at the hands of this demon, how utterly embarrassing!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“It’s hardly our fault, is it? He’s a true disciple of the Seven Feathers Alliance, rumored to possess remnants of the Three-legged Golden Crow bloodline. His presence here at the Ghostly Black Marshlands is supposedly the fulfillment of a favor between the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign and the Seven Feathers Alliance. How could ordinary people like us contend with such an individual?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Hidden Yang Manor indulges him excessively. When we wish to leave, we must report thrice, yet he merely informs the gatekeepers and strolls right out!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Listening to their discussions, Sun Lingtong’s curiosity was piqued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Seven Feathers Alliance was a superpower comparable to the Soul Devouring Sect and the Void Sect, but primarily composed of demonic cultivators. At its inception, it was formed by seven ancient spirit birds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The White-Haired Dragon Sovereign was notably a renowned Soul Formation cultivator within the Flying Cloud Country.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sun Lingtong glanced again at the bulletin, realizing it listed rankings based on Yang energy contributions among the male consorts of the Hidden Yang Manor. Only the top fifty were displayed; naturally, Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo) wasn’t mentioned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“So, Jin Yangzi occupies the top of these rankings persistently, not just due to his formidable strength but also thanks to his influential backing. Above all, his bloodline grants him extraordinary potential!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“No wonder he’s so arrogant - no one dares provoke him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sun Lingtong departed the central courtyard, approaching the manor’s gates just in time to glimpse Jin Yangzi’s retreating figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“He’s heading out again?” Sun Lingtong’s thoughts stirred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“With the treasures Jin Yangzi carries, if I managed to rob him, the gains would be tremendous!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong licked his lips, his usual thieving instincts flaring up again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Jin Yangzi is a true disciple of the Seven Feathers Alliance. True disciples from such superpowers are at least Golden Core stage cultivators, with some even at the Nascent Soul stage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“But Jin Yangzi must only be at Golden Core!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Sun Lingtong was very certain of his conclusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">With all the internal and external threats faced by White Paper Immortal City, it was impossible for them to tolerate the presence of Nascent Soul stage experts from other powers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">If Jin Yangzi truly was at Nascent Soul, he certainly wouldn’t be staying within Hidden Yang Manor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“I can rob this fellow!” Having come from the Void Sect himself, Sun Lingtong was unfazed by Jin Yangzi’s prestigious background - instead, it excited him further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Having acquired the Evil Void God’s Bone marrow in the Thousand Peak Forest, Sun Lingtong’s thieving techniques had greatly advanced, bolstering his confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Thinking thus, he discreetly trailed Jin Yangzi, using his stealth techniques to gather traces of his aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">At a fork in the road, Sun Lingtong parted ways from Jin Yangzi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He didn’t immediately act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Firstly, he needed to carefully observe and gather more information. Secondly, he had urgent matters to attend to; otherwise, he’d have trouble explaining himself to Ning Zhuo later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Still unfamiliar with White Paper Immortal City, Sun Lingtong wandered a bit before finding a trustworthy route - someone secretly dealing in confidential intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">As he followed this path into a narrow alley, he suddenly sensed Jin Yangzi’s aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“He’s nearby?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Since it was along his route anyway, Sun Lingtong decisively concealed himself and approached silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In the alleyway, Jin Yangzi halted, hands clasped behind him, suddenly turning with a sneer, “Come out, sneaky rat! You’ve followed me this far - show yourself!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong tensed, ready to employ his escape techniques, but Jin Yangzi glanced briefly in his direction, “Not you, short stuff.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Hehehe.” A chilling laugh echoed as a mysterious cultivator appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Sun Lingtong sharply turned to see an individual hunched over, skin swollen grotesquely, with dark bags beneath bloodshot eyes. Wet hair constantly dripped water, as though he’d just crawled from a river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">A shiver of fear ran down Sun Lingtong’s spine!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He hadn’t even realized someone had been following him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Jin Yangzi maintained his haughty posture, coldly asking, “Who are you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The mysterious cultivator stared at Jin Yangzi with his eerie, bloodshot eyes, “The one here to claim your life.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Jin Yangzi burst into arrogant laughter, “A nameless nobody dares threaten me, Jin Yangzi? Don’t you realize I’ve known about your pursuit all along and deliberately lured you here?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Before finishing his sentence, Jin Yangzi struck suddenly, slicing forward with a radiant golden blade formed by his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">As he acted, he unleashed the aura of a Golden Core cultivator, fiercely asserting his dominance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">However, as the fierce golden blade approached the mysterious cultivator, its brilliance rapidly diminished. By the time it reached him, it was reduced to the size of a mere marble, its formidable power all but extinguished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The mysterious cultivator flicked it away effortlessly, shattering it into fragments. A chilling smile spread across his face as he spoke, his voice dripping with malevolence. “Did you truly think you’d discovered me by accident? Foolish. It was by design.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He continued, his voice echoing eerily. “I counted on your arrogance to draw me out, Jin Yangzi. Your pride is precisely what seals your doom!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">In an instant, the alleyway vanished, replaced by a grand waterfall plunging into a deep, turbulent pool. This was his Dao Field - Hidden Scales of the Dragon Pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Jin Yangzi’s eyes narrowed sharply as he quickly soared into the sky, avoiding the churning waters. Sun Lingtong, caught off guard, leaped onto a precarious rock in the pool, positioned awkwardly between the two powerful cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Standing opposite Jin Yangzi at the pool’s edge, the mysterious cultivator unleashed his attack. With a wave of his hand, he summoned a dragon-shaped surge of water from the pool. The watery dragon lunged towards Jin Yangzi, who swiftly drew a long spear, its tip radiating brilliant light. A casual jab from the spear shattered the aquatic beast effortlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Jin Yangzi sneered contemptuously, “Your Dao Field surprised me. You’re a devotee of the Hidden Scale Dragon Lord? Nevertheless, these petty attacks are barely worth my attention!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Is that so?” The mysterious cultivator smirked ominously, launching a flurry of water-based techniques. Yet, regardless of how cleverly the water twisted and took shape, Jin Yangzi dismissed each attack with mocking ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Something’s terribly wrong here!” Sun Lingtong thought anxiously, sensing a hidden danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Fortunately, neither combatant targeted him, each fully focused on the other as their primary enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Jin Yangzi effortlessly deflected another series of strikes, his confidence turning to irritation. “Are you mocking me? Enough of your games! Show me your true strength!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The mysterious cultivator chuckled darkly. “I’ve already revealed my power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Jin Yangzi growled in anger. “If this is all you have, mere Foundation Establishment tricks, I’ll shred you to pieces!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Jin Yangzi, for all your bravado, you’ve yet to notice your predicament,” the mysterious cultivator replied coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Startled, Jin Yangzi quickly scanned himself with his divine sense but initially found nothing amiss. His face soon twisted in horror as the mysterious cultivator activated another technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Suddenly, Jin Yangzi’s artifacts and enchanted items - his robes, boots, and more - were enveloped by mist and stripped from his body. Desperately, he channeled his energy to reclaim them, but discovered his connection to these treasures had been completely severed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“What sorcery is this?!” Jin Yangzi roared in fury and shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sun Lingtong’s eyes widened in realization. “Overturned Water! This is the legendary Overturned Water!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Overturned Water - a sinister treasure of the water element known for severing all connections with whatever it enveloped. As the proverb went, spilled water cannot be gathered again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Jin Yangzi realized too late that most of his treasures had been corrupted, rendered useless by Overturned Water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">In a last-ditch effort, he transformed into his true form - a majestic golden crow - and attempted to escape by soaring skyward. Yet the mighty waterfall surged down mercilessly, crashing him back to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Within the powerful torrent, a blinding golden light burst forth. Jin Yangzi unleashed his desperate demon art - Crimson Blood Golden Light Slash! Though extremely taxing, its destructive power far surpassed a cultivator’s normal limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The mysterious cultivator grunted softly. A dragon’s resonant roar emanated from the waterfall, rapidly consuming and weakening Jin Yangzi’s desperate strike until its dazzling radiance was utterly extinguished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Jin Yangzi clenched his teeth, helpless against the overwhelming power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“This is truly dire!” Sun Lingtong thought desperately. He had hoped Jin Yangzi might break free of the Dao Field, providing a chance to escape. Instead, Jin Yangzi was thoroughly suppressed, sealing their grim fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Even if this is your Dao Field, I still have recognition within White Paper Immortal City and remain unaffected by its grand formation!” Jin Yangzi glared fiercely at the mysterious cultivator. “You’re also at the Golden Core stage, yet you’re similarly unrestricted. Who exactly are you?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The mysterious cultivator smiled chillingly. “The one who’ll end your life.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Massive waves surged violently, submerging Jin Yangzi with merciless force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Jin Yangzi frantically beat his wings, using all his strength to break free. Time after time, he managed to briefly escape the surging waters, only to be ruthlessly hammered back down by the cascading waterfall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">After several exhausting cycles, Jin Yangzi gradually weakened, the golden glow representing his life force eventually extinguishing beneath the turbulent pool.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“Thieving Technique - Piercing the Void!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong desperately attempted to flee amidst despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But the mysterious cultivator didn’t even need to act personally. The Dao Field alone sufficed to nullify Sun Lingtong’s escape, rendering his efforts completely futile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“Within this Dao Field, any method used by my enemies is significantly weakened.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Little Zhuo, save me quickly!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">In that instant, the life-and-death moment ignited the life-saving treasure, erupting with blinding mirror-like radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The brilliant light enveloped Sun Lingtong, causing him to vanish instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">When he reappeared, he was back inside Residence A-01 in the Hidden Yang Manor. Ning Zhuo stood with his Life-Bound Artifact, the Spirit Communing Mirror, having successfully rescued Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“What happened, boss?” Ning Zhuo had reacted urgently only after hearing the desperate cry for help and was still unaware of the preceding events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Sun Lingtong patted his chest, breathing raggedly. “That was… way too intense…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">For a moment, he struggled to speak clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Hmm?” The mysterious cultivator was astonished to see Sun Lingtong escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“That technique was externally invoked and ignored the suppression of my Dao Field. It seems like some sort of summoning method.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“No matter.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Jin Yangzi’s death was never something that could be concealed anyway, nor did I intend to hide it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">“White Paper Immortal City,” he chuckled sinisterly, “is finally about to descend into chaos.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The mysterious cultivator produced a bone orb, casually tossing it forward. It transformed into an ominous ghostly gateway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">As the gateway opened, countless water ghosts and ghostly soldiers surged forth, having long been prepared for this moment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Shortly thereafter, miserable screams and frantic calls for help filled the previously quiet alleys, plunging the area into complete disorder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The ghostly soldiers marched out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Clang! Clang! Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The alarm bells of White Paper Immortal City resonated urgently, echoing through the entire city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The city’s great formation activated, aggressively suppressing the emergent tide of water ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The city guards swiftly mobilized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Yet, halfway through their deployment, new orders arrived from the upper echelons, redirecting a large portion of the cultivators to defend the city walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Ghost Tide had arrived earlier than anticipated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
