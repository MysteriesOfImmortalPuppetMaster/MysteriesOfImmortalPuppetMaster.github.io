<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 180: Golden Core Enters the Fray</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">It was the Zhou Family's turn.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Zhou Family Patriarch appeared, "Our family rose to prominence with a Spirit Gathering Formation. As everyone knows, this formation birthed a Formation Spirit."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"The Spirit Gathering Formation can consume some of its own spirituality to cast spells and enhance soul bodies."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"With this spell, cultivators can automatically absorb external spiritual energy, convert it into personal mana, and reduce the various costs of spellcasting."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The Zheng Family presented the Ghost Weapon Cultivation Art, the Zhou Family activated the Spirit Gathering Formation Spirit, and the Ning Family brought out the Foundation Establishment Ghost Cultivator Ning Xie, who possessed the innate talent of Snow Soul Ice Essence!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo's mood grew increasingly solemn.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">These were the foundations of each family, all grand gestures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Usually kept hidden, they were now brought out for use.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo thought of what the Ning Family Patriarch had said, "This concerns the Golden Core Patriarch," making the actions of the three families seem reasonable.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Alright, you continue your discussions; we won't delay you." The Zhou Family Patriarch waved his hand and left the secret chamber.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Ning Family Patriarch followed suit.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Xie remained floating in mid-air, arms crossed, staring coldly at Ning Zhuo.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo acted as if he couldn't feel it, treating Ning Xie like air, which made Ning Xie quite frustrated.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Zheng Hua continued, "These five jade slips record all the materials, spirit stones, and mechanical components we've gathered."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Because it's extremely difficult to bring items into the Lava Immortal Palace, the resources we can use in this battle are limited to these."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Xie of the Ning Family was the greatest achievement of the three families' joint research into the Lava Immortal Palace, attempting to bring items inside.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">In fact, each family had hidden ghost cultivators as part of their foundations.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Only Ning Xie succeeded because of his innate talent, which formed a mysterious synergy with NIng Xiaohui's talent.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo placed the jade slip on his forehead, and after examining it, his mood grew even more solemn.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The contents of the jade slip were very detailed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Just the spirit stones were calculated meticulously.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">It tallied the number of explorers and assumed that everyone chose the spirit stone reward, calculating the maximum number of spirit stones the entire exploration team could obtain.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">If no one chose the reward, it also calculated the minimum amount of spirit stones.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">It divided the stages into thirty percent, fifty percent, seventy percent, and ninety percent, each with detailed spirit stone numbers.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The same applied to mechanical components like the Hanging Ring and the Small Flying Box.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The resources that could be purchased in the preparation room using spirit stones, the duration of each crafting tool, were all calculated with extreme precision.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Moreover, the jade slip listed over a dozen mechanical constructs, categorized in detail.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zheng Hua explained timely, "These are the mechanical constructs we've selected after discussions among the three families."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Their functions and capabilities are detailed, and the materials and spirit stones required to construct them are meticulously calculated."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"If anyone has good ideas for mechanical constructs, feel free to propose them for further discussion."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo remained silent.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Zhou Zeshen looked at Ning Zhuo, not letting him off, smiling sincerely, "Brother Ning, you must have noticed that most of these mechanical constructs come from my sect, the Mudflow Sect."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"The Mudflow Sect excels in terrain-altering mechanisms, which is also the sect's main livelihood."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"The Ground Drilling Mouse is used to soften mountains and create tunnels, the Night Sky Bat for terrain detection and 3D mapping, the White Tiger Assault Chariot for large tunnel excavation, and the Mud Gate Earth Hammer for breaking boulders and solidifying foundations."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Brother Ning's talent in mechanisms is well-known. Your designs, the Mechanical Fire Monkey and the Fire Bamboo Snake, are also excellent in combat."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Therefore, your suggestions are very important!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly, "I will do my utmost, but these mechanisms need careful study before I can give my opinion. This matter is too important to speak carelessly."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Hahaha." Zhou Zeshen laughed, "Then we await Brother Ning's high opinion."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zheng Hua continued, "Next, I'll introduce the battle tactics we've prepared jointly."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"The first is the Zhou Family's battle formation."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">After the discussion, Ning Zhuo returned to his private room.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Along the way, his brows were tightly knit, his mood heavy.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Preparation room, mature tactics, the foundations of the three families," Ning Zhuo pondered, feeling the immense pressure.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His previous assumptions were correct; the three families indeed relied on the preparation room's functions.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">But it wasn't entirely correct.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Whether it was the joint battle tactics or the foundations brought out by the three families, they were almost all unexpected.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"The secret concerning the Golden Core Patriarch" made it even harder for him to guess what was happening at the higher levels.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"The three families united... strength in numbers." Ning Zhuo deeply felt the advantage of numbers.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Even if none of them made it to the rankings to receive abundant spirit stone rewards, the rewards from the sheer number of people alone were already substantial.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The three families united all their resources, meticulously calculating and optimizing the best combinations.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">They fully tapped into their combat potential.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Now, Ning Zhuo's greatest relief was that the exploration route of soul entering the Immortal Palace prohibited external items.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This was a significant layer of protection for Ning Zhuo.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">If external items were allowed, the combined power of the three families would be even more terrifying!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo took out the Floating Cloud Cloak, immersed himself in the floating clouds, and then entered the Immortal Palace.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Sun Lingtong had been waiting for him.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo conveyed the latest information, making Sun Lingtong's mood equally heavy, "The enemy is so strong. It seems we must let Cheng Bai join the battle to have a chance at victory."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo sighed, "Relying solely on Yuan Dasheng is indeed difficult."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"But we can't be too aggressive. If it doesn't work out, I won't take the formation this time."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"We must guard against the Soul Devouring Sect's hidden moves."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sun Lingtong nodded, "Don't worry, I have a plan!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sun Lingtong's soul returned to his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Looking at Cheng Bai's storage bag in front of him, his brows furrowed, his face resolute.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He had already made up his mind, "Little Zhuo is determined to seize the Lava Immortal Palace."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"This goal is not just a major opportunity in his life but also his mother's last wish, a task he must complete!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"This is of great significance to him!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"He speaks lightly, thinking I don't know? If he doesn't take the formation, the three families will advance unimpeded, possibly arousing their suspicion."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"As his elder, if I don't support him now, when will I?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Sun Lingtong was slowly breaking Cheng Bai's storage bag, progressing slowly but steadily.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Time is limited; I need to take some risks!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">As a member of the demonic faction, Sun Lingtong never lacked the spirit of adventure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">During the Qi Refining Stage, he had stolen treasures from the Foundation Establishment Stage, had been caught stealing, and had been imprisoned and tortured by his gang.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He didn't have to take risks; he enjoyed the thrill, the excitement of stealing and other stimulating activities that made him feel physically and mentally refreshed and happy.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Let's do it!" Sun Lingtong puffed up his cheeks, mustering all his strength, and cast a spell.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Soon, Cheng Bai's storage bag was opened, and a wisp of black-gray smoke floated into the air.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong's eyes were quick, and he extinguished the smoke before it drifted away!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Good!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"My calculations were correct; there were no other defensive measures. Hahaha, I got a Golden Core cultivator's storage bag!" Sun Lingtong immediately checked, finding Cheng Bai's storage bag filled with valuable items.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">There were seven Magical Artifacts alone.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The cultivation resources were almost all closely related to soul cultivation.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The unrelated materials were all Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Such materials were not easy to sell and required suitable auctions or trading partners.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">So, they had accumulated in Cheng Bai's hands.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The most valuable were some of Cheng Bai's personal items.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"These are all excellent fuel for the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra." Sun Lingtong beamed with joy.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo had already passed the relevant sutra to Sun Lingtong.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Therefore, during Ning Zhuo's special training, Sun Lingtong could also refine items on his own, adding spirituality to Cheng Bai.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">In the darkness, two ghost fires suddenly lit up.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Upon closer inspection, the ghost fires were actually the eyes of a cultivator.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Luo Shang!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">A true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect, tasked with finding and avenging the true culprit behind Cheng Bai's death.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He had long since infiltrated Fire Persimmon Immortal City, avoiding attention and hiding his identity.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"The two Soul Devouring Sect disciples in the City Lord's dungeon were just bait and traps."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Why has Han Ming been missing and out of contact?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"To this day, she hasn't responded to my secret transmissions."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"Hmm?!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">At this moment, Luo Shang sensed Cheng Bai's aura.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He had been using the sect's secret technique.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"It's in that direction... inside the mountain!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The ghost fire vanished, and Luo Shang immediately moved.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Not long after he disappeared, a female cultivator appeared.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Her face was like a peach blossom, her figure tall and graceful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">She was Yang Chanyu of the Void Sect.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Yang Chanyu had been mingling in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, constantly changing her appearance and wandering around, mainly to find Sun Lingtong.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">In the sect, Sun Lingtong's soul tablet showed no abnormalities.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Although the black market had been raided and Sun Lingtong was wanted, Yang Chanyu was convinced that Sun Lingtong was still in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Where is that little rascal hiding?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"I left secret signals, but none were triggered."  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Hmph, he's deliberately avoiding me!"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Yang Chanyu couldn't find Sun Lingtong but unexpectedly discovered Luo Shang.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The moment Luo Shang made a move, Yang Chanyu sensed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">After some thought, she decided to follow him secretly to see what Luo Shang had discovered.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Luo Shang cautiously found a gap in the Immortal City Grand Formation, circled around, and found the secret base inside the mountain.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">However, when he entered the secret base, Sun Lingtong had already left.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Sun Lingtong had gone to another underground base to replenish Cheng Bai's spirituality.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Luo Shang thought for a moment and decided to wait for Sun Lingtong to return, planning to catch him off guard!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"A secret underground base... wait, it's Sun Lingtong's aura. Hmph, you little brat, I've finally found you." Yang Chanyu snorted coldly and also hid herself.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Meanwhile, in another secret chamber.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Zhu Xuanji gathered the Golden Core Patriarchs of the three families for a second secret discussion.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">In the first discussion, Zhu Xuanji proposed cooperation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He wanted the Golden Core Patriarchs of the three families to assist him fully, combining their forces to invade Fire Persimmon Mountain and directly attack the Demon Ape's lair to seize the Demon General's corpse!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">This action was highly risky, even for Golden Core cultivators, who could face death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">But if six Golden Core cultivators worked together sincerely, there was a significant chance of success.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The key was the high reward!  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Part of it was the rich spoils from destroying the Demon Ape's lair, and the other part was the generous remuneration Zhu Xuanji offered to the Golden Core cultivators for their assistance.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The remuneration was very tempting.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Therefore, the Golden Core cultivators of the three families were hesitant.  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Zhu Xuanji asked with a smile, "Fellow Daoists, have you made your decision?"  </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Zheng Shuangou was the first to speak, "Our side can send two people, but... the price must go up!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
