<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The wind surged from within, continuously flowing outward, amplifying the potency of Chen Lingfeng’s spells dramatically, but at the cost of his accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, minor flaws could not obscure brilliance!<br/>
<br/>
Spell after spell erupted, Chen Lingfeng’s casting speed instantly surging by sixty percent.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's long-range spells were intercepted mid-air by Chen Lingfeng's wind-based magic, completely covered and annihilated.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng’s relentless spells overcame Ning Zhuo's offensive, counterattacking aggressively.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Chen Lingfeng’s unstoppable momentum, Ning Zhuo decisively released a massive swarm of Mechanical Golden Swallows.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Swallows soared upward, dazzling like celebratory clouds shimmering with golden light above Ning Zhuo. They quickly split into three groups, flying swiftly.<br/>
<br/>
One flock dove straight into Chen Lingfeng’s wind spells, instantly disintegrating into countless fragments.<br/>
<br/>
The other two flocks split left and right, circling around before converging in a pincer attack toward Chen Lingfeng!<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng swiftly retreated, wind encasing his body, granting extraordinary agility.<br/>
<br/>
Unable to adjust their course in time, the front part of the Golden Swallow swarm collided into itself, plummeting to destruction.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, the majority merged into a cohesive group, soaring skyward, resembling glittering golden fish forming an arching bridge in mid-air, before diving downward.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng inhaled deeply, then unleashed a powerful gale.<br/>
<br/>
Emerald-green winds scattered the flock, flinging the Golden Swallows apart chaotically, like chrysanthemums scattered by rain and wind - a scene tragically beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
In his heightened state, Chen Lingfeng’s combat power had become astonishing.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s Mechanical Golden Swallows, recently deployed, were nearly annihilated!<br/>
<br/>
However, the deaths of these mechanical golden swallows, much like the mechanical puppets, also contributed to Ning Zhuo’s combat strength.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng, with his keen perception, sensed another surge in Ning Zhuo’s aura. He spoke, his voice carried by the wind to reach Ning Zhuo’s ears:<br/>
<br/>
"The army strategist's analysis was correct."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, the more of your mechanical soldiers die, the stronger your personal enhancement becomes."<br/>
<br/>
"It’s similar to techniques like Martyr's Burning Soldiers, Ember-Bone Blade, and Blood Banner Mutual Demise."<br/>
<br/>
"However, what you are using should be military tactics."<br/>
<br/>
"You hold a military rank and are part of an army’s structure. As a result, you are not only drawing from the power of your troops but also leveraging the national strength of the Two Note Kingdom."<br/>
<br/>
"If you were to leave the military system, the power of this technique would plummet!"<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng’s words were meant to exert psychological pressure on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
In his view, no matter how astonishingly talented Ning Zhuo was, he was still a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old youth. Thrown into such a chaotic battlefield, his heart might be his weak spot.<br/>
<br/>
He was completely overthinking it!<br/>
<br/>
The years of enduring hardship in Fire Persimmon Immortal City had forged Ning Zhuo’s unyielding nature.<br/>
<br/>
Since childhood, he had been contemplating ways to deal with the City Lord’s Mansion and Nascent Soul cultivators. How could he possibly be shaken by a few words?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained expressionless, his heart undisturbed. In just a short while, his aura had strengthened even further.<br/>
<br/>
He had already anticipated the exposure of such information after repeatedly using the Hero’s Return Art in battle.<br/>
<br/>
His main focus was on controlling his mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
And he was beginning to feel the difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
Controlling so many mechanical puppets at once was already pushing Ning Zhuo to his limit. And this was even with Sun Lingtong secretly assisting from the shadows, quietly taking control of a portion of them.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo were to simultaneously control both the mechanical puppets and the mechanical golden swallows, the difficulty would spike dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
This was mainly because the two types of mechanical constructs required vastly different methods of control, making it hard for Ning Zhuo to handle both at once.<br/>
<br/>
So, after releasing the swarm of golden swallows, he decisively sacrificed a portion of them to free up his energy.<br/>
<br/>
The clash between the two flanks of golden swallows also exposed his shortcomings in control.<br/>
<br/>
Once the entire swarm of mechanical golden swallows was wiped out, Ning Zhuo immediately felt a sense of relief.<br/>
<br/>
“I can't recklessly release that many golden swallows at once again,” Ning Zhuo’s pupils contracted slightly as he silently warned himself.<br/>
<br/>
This batch of golden swallows had been meant for emergencies. Unlike puppets, these constructs weren’t in abundant supply.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo once again deployed mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
The army was instantly replenished, and their formation regained its splendor!<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng’s eye twitched as he watched.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, the total value of mechanical puppets Ning Zhuo had used already far exceeded his entire net worth!<br/>
<br/>
“This guy is insanely rich!”<br/>
<br/>
“So this is what a scion of a major clan looks like?”<br/>
<br/>
“The Ning Clan has this much money? I’ve never seen a rich heir throw wealth around like this.”<br/>
<br/>
“He’s just a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and he’s wealthier than me!”<br/>
<br/>
Compared to Ning Zhuo, Chen Lingfeng felt like he was some backwater bumpkin from a poverty-stricken province - completely unworthy and unpresentable.<br/>
<br/>
This comparison spurred him to intensify his assault - his casting speed growing faster and faster.<br/>
<br/>
Innate Talent - Mad Gale Temperament!<br/>
<br/>
A top-tier talent.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was coming close to truly grasping the power of this innate gift.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng displayed the combat power of a peak Golden Core cultivator!<br/>
<br/>
On his own, he suppressed Ning Zhuo, Yuan Dasheng, Meng Yehu, and the mechanical army.<br/>
<br/>
Wild winds howled, blades of air sliced through the air - Chen Lingfeng's momentum was violent and overwhelming. The area around him had been cleared, and all three armies were forced to retreat!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was obstructed, unable to advance.<br/>
<br/>
He gritted his teeth in silence and held his ground, relying on the continuous reinforcement of mechanical puppets to stubbornly resist.<br/>
<br/>
The pressure gradually lessened, and Ning Zhuo began to regain his composure.<br/>
<br/>
"Not good! Even after activating my innate talent, I still can't secure victory?!"<br/>
<br/>
Though Chen Lingfeng held the advantage, the longer the battle dragged on, the more uneasy he became.<br/>
<br/>
His attacks grew increasingly frenzied, but his aim deteriorated badly, creating obvious openings.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo controlled the mechanical puppets with precision. Sometimes, simply shifting the formation was enough to evade the brunt of Chen Lingfeng’s attacks - preserving his forces at minimal cost.<br/>
<br/>
From time to time, he even sent out small swarms of Golden Swallows to launch flanking attacks, helping to relieve the pressure on himself.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had been quietly supporting Ning Zhuo all along, helping him control the mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo is getting stronger!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had been observing the battle closely. The moment he perceived this shift, joy bloomed in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
A bystander sees things more clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong clearly noticed: Ning Zhuo's improvement was visibly significant while fighting Chen Lingfeng one-on-one.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn’t just that he had become adept at controlling his mechanical constructs - his various mechanical techniques and Five Element spells were all becoming more and more proficient in his hands. <br/>
<br/>
His timing in using them was also getting better and better.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was like a piece of jade.<br/>
<br/>
Under immense pressure, he was being relentlessly polished. As the saying goes, “Jade must be carved to become a gem” - and this piece of jade, Ning Zhuo, was finally beginning to shine with a brilliance of his own.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo’s accumulation has reached a critical step - he’s undergoing a qualitative transformation!”<br/>
<br/>
“In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, even though he kept a low profile, he always studied diligently. And with me giving him pointers, his foundational skills became rock-solid.”<br/>
<br/>
“Since leaving the mountain to journey across the world, he has never slacked in his cultivation, constantly practicing with tireless dedication. Though he hasn’t had much time to divide among everything, he’s been using real combat as training.”<br/>
<br/>
“Especially during his time in the army - he’s fought countless battles, large and small. That’s been an intense training ground for him.”<br/>
<br/>
“And now, finally, his accumulated progress has reached the tipping point - it’s beginning to elevate!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was sincerely happy for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Wind Movement - Wind Erosion!<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng’s unease grew stronger. He puffed out his cheeks and blew out a fierce blast of yellow wind.<br/>
<br/>
The yellow wind howled - impossible to defend against. <br/>
<br/>
Everything it touched disintegrated into powder, scattered like smoke and dust. Its power was utterly terrifying!<br/>
<br/>
Just like weathering by wind, the stone slab shields Ning Zhuo had erected around himself all turned to sand and scattered into nothingness.<br/>
<br/>
Next, the three-layered Fiery Fire Barriers around him flickered like dying candlelight in a storm, and then vanished.<br/>
<br/>
Even the thick layer of Earth Armor clinging to his body immediately began to weather away, cracking apart in chunks and disintegrating, revealing the inner layer beneath...<br/>
<br/>
-Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor.<br/>
<br/>
This mechanical armor stood firm and unmoved, glowing faintly with Buddhist light, displaying its formidable defensive power.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn’t unleash the Profound Gold Slash - several of his defensive spells had been broken, and his spiritual power had been drained significantly.<br/>
<br/>
If he forcefully unleashed the Profound Gold Slash now, it would no doubt drain all his spiritual energy!<br/>
<br/>
In this kind of situation, the better option was to activate a magical tool or magical artifact - that would save far more spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
Foundation Establishment cultivators generally relied on magical tools. Even though Ning Zhuo now had Golden Core-level combat power, he was still fundamentally different from a true Golden Core cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
And that difference… lay exactly here.<br/>
<br/>
His spiritual energy hadn’t undergone the fundamental transformation that came with forming a golden core. If he used a magical treasure, the consumption would be enormous - practically no different from forcefully casting the Profound Gold Slash.<br/>
<br/>
So, Ning Zhuo chose to use a magical tool instead.<br/>
<br/>
With a wave of his hand, a barrage of Thunder Beads rained down around Chen Lingfeng.<br/>
<br/>
Boom! Boom! Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Consumable magical tools often unleashed fierce power.<br/>
<br/>
The chain of explosions sent thick clouds of dust and smoke rolling across that section of the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
But the next moment, a howling gust swept through, dispersing the smog and revealing Chen Lingfeng.<br/>
<br/>
He looked a bit worse for wear, but on closer inspection, it was clear he hadn’t suffered any real injuries - just a rather disheveled appearance.<br/>
<br/>
Still, Ning Zhuo had achieved what he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
By spending those Thunder Beads, he had successfully interrupted Chen Lingfeng’s spellcasting, forcing the cessation of that highly dangerous Erosion spell.<br/>
<br/>
In the very next moment, the Nightblade Shadow Tiger emerged!<br/>
<br/>
Ghostclaw Strike!<br/>
<br/>
A vicious claw stabbed straight into Chen Lingfeng’s back, and in an instant, blood sprayed forth!<br/>
<br/>
Puff, puff - two more stabbing strikes in quick succession pierced all the way to the bone.<br/>
<br/>
Once he activated his innate talent, Chen Lingfeng had to abandon all forms of defense to allow the wind to rise within his bones and flow outward.<br/>
<br/>
“Ahhh!” Chen Lingfeng howled toward the sky. A violent wind burst from inside him, blasting outward and forcefully blowing the Nightblade Shadow Tiger away.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity to close in.<br/>
<br/>
The Heavily-Armored Blood Ape Yuan Dasheng charged at the forefront, clearing the path.<br/>
<br/>
The Nightblade Shadow Tiger pounced once more.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng’s eyes were blood-red.<br/>
<br/>
Windstride - Gale Sphere Spiral!<br/>
<br/>
A tornado erupted, rapidly expanding to engulf Ning Zhuo and the various constructs around him. Then, it suddenly contracted, forming a massive emerald wind sphere.<br/>
<br/>
Using the last shred of his sanity, Chen Lingfeng raised both hands, lifting the wind sphere into the air.<br/>
<br/>
Then, with the area around him cleared out, Chen Lingfeng completely lost control and fell into a frenzied state. Friend or foe - it didn’t matter anymore. He began attacking wildly.<br/>
<br/>
Overextending one’s innate talent for too long would always lead to consequences like this.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had, through his own strength alone, driven Chen Lingfeng mad!<br/>
<br/>
And now, Chen Lingfeng had brought chaos to the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it. He’s fully unleashed his innate talent - Chen Lingfeng might be just a Golden Core cultivator, but he can match a Nascent Soul!”<br/>
<br/>
“We can’t deal with him now - retreat first.”<br/>
<br/>
"The cultivators familiar with the intel all began to retreat, doing their utmost to distance themselves from Chen Lingfeng.<br/>
<br/>
Even Nascent Soul–level cultivators were no exception."<br/>
<br/>
The wind sphere carried Ning Zhuo, flying across the battlefield for a distance before finally dispersing in midair.<br/>
<br/>
Only then did Ning Zhuo regain his freedom.<br/>
<br/>
He and his mechanical constructs had just landed when a massive figure struck at him-<br/>
<br/>
The Elephant King, Xiang Yue!</div>
