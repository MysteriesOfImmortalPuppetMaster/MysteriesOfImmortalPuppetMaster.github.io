<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The wind surged from within, continuously flowing outward, amplifying the potency of Chen Lingfeng’s spells dramatically, but at the cost of his accuracy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Yet, minor flaws could not obscure brilliance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Spell after spell erupted, Chen Lingfeng’s casting speed instantly surging by sixty percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo's long-range spells were intercepted mid-air by Chen Lingfeng's wind-based magic, completely covered and annihilated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Chen Lingfeng’s relentless spells overcame Ning Zhuo's offensive, counterattacking aggressively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Seeing Chen Lingfeng’s unstoppable momentum, Ning Zhuo decisively released a massive swarm of Mechanical Golden Swallows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Golden Swallows soared upward, dazzling like celebratory clouds shimmering with golden light above Ning Zhuo. They quickly split into three groups, flying swiftly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">One flock dove straight into Chen Lingfeng’s wind spells, instantly disintegrating into countless fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The other two flocks split left and right, circling around before converging in a pincer attack toward Chen Lingfeng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Chen Lingfeng swiftly retreated, wind encasing his body, granting extraordinary agility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Unable to adjust their course in time, the front part of the Golden Swallow swarm collided into itself, plummeting to destruction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Yet, the majority merged into a cohesive group, soaring skyward, resembling glittering golden fish forming an arching bridge in mid-air, before diving downward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Chen Lingfeng inhaled deeply, then unleashed a powerful gale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Emerald-green winds scattered the flock, flinging the Golden Swallows apart chaotically, like chrysanthemums scattered by rain and wind - a scene tragically beautiful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In his heightened state, Chen Lingfeng’s combat power had become astonishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo’s Mechanical Golden Swallows, recently deployed, were nearly annihilated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">However, the deaths of these mechanical golden swallows, much like the mechanical puppets, also contributed to Ning Zhuo’s combat strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Chen Lingfeng, with his keen perception, sensed another surge in Ning Zhuo’s aura. He spoke, his voice carried by the wind to reach Ning Zhuo’s ears:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"The army strategist's analysis was correct."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Ning Zhuo, the more of your mechanical soldiers die, the stronger your personal enhancement becomes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"It’s similar to techniques like Martyr's Burning Soldiers, Ember-Bone Blade, and Blood Banner Mutual Demise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"However, what you are using should be military tactics."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"You hold a military rank and are part of an army’s structure. As a result, you are not only drawing from the power of your troops but also leveraging the national strength of the Two Note Kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"If you were to leave the military system, the power of this technique would plummet!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Chen Lingfeng’s words were meant to exert psychological pressure on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">In his view, no matter how astonishingly talented Ning Zhuo was, he was still a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old youth. Thrown into such a chaotic battlefield, his heart might be his weak spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He was completely overthinking it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The years of enduring hardship in Fire Persimmon Immortal City had forged Ning Zhuo’s unyielding nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Since childhood, he had been contemplating ways to deal with the City Lord’s Mansion and Nascent Soul cultivators. How could he possibly be shaken by a few words?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo remained expressionless, his heart undisturbed. In just a short while, his aura had strengthened even further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He had already anticipated the exposure of such information after repeatedly using the Hero’s Return Technique in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">His main focus was on controlling his mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">And he was beginning to feel the difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Controlling so many mechanical puppets at once was already pushing Ning Zhuo to his limit. And this was even with Sun Lingtong secretly assisting from the shadows, quietly taking control of a portion of them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">If Ning Zhuo were to simultaneously control both the mechanical puppets and the mechanical golden swallows, the difficulty would spike dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This was mainly because the two types of mechanical constructs required vastly different methods of control, making it hard for Ning Zhuo to handle both at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">So, after releasing the swarm of golden swallows, he decisively sacrificed a portion of them to free up his energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The clash between the two flanks of golden swallows also exposed his shortcomings in control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Once the entire swarm of mechanical golden swallows was wiped out, Ning Zhuo immediately felt a sense of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“I can't recklessly release that many golden swallows at once again,” Ning Zhuo’s pupils contracted slightly as he silently warned himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This batch of golden swallows had been meant for emergencies. Unlike puppets, these constructs weren’t in abundant supply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo once again deployed mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The army was instantly replenished, and their formation regained its splendor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Chen Lingfeng’s eye twitched as he watched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">At this point, the total value of mechanical puppets Ning Zhuo had used already far exceeded his entire net worth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“This guy is insanely rich!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“So this is what a scion of a major clan looks like?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“The Ning Clan has this much money? I’ve never seen a rich heir throw wealth around like this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“He’s just a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and he’s wealthier than me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Compared to Ning Zhuo, Chen Lingfeng felt like he was some backwater bumpkin from a poverty-stricken province - completely unworthy and unpresentable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">This comparison spurred him to intensify his assault - his casting speed growing faster and faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Innate Talent - Mad Gale Temperament!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A top-tier talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo was coming close to truly grasping the power of this innate gift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Chen Lingfeng displayed the combat power of a peak Golden Core cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">On his own, he suppressed Ning Zhuo, Yuan Dasheng, Meng Yehu, and the mechanical army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Wild winds howled, blades of air sliced through the air - Chen Lingfeng's momentum was violent and overwhelming. The area around him had been cleared, and all three armies were forced to retreat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo was obstructed, unable to advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He gritted his teeth in silence and held his ground, relying on the continuous reinforcement of mechanical puppets to stubbornly resist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The pressure gradually lessened, and Ning Zhuo began to regain his composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Not good! Even after activating my innate talent, I still can't secure victory?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Though Chen Lingfeng held the advantage, the longer the battle dragged on, the more uneasy he became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">His attacks grew increasingly frenzied, but his aim deteriorated badly, creating obvious openings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo controlled the mechanical puppets with precision. Sometimes, simply shifting the formation was enough to evade the brunt of Chen Lingfeng’s attacks - preserving his forces at minimal cost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">From time to time, he even sent out small swarms of Golden Swallows to launch flanking attacks, helping to relieve the pressure on himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Sun Lingtong had been quietly supporting Ning Zhuo all along, helping him control the mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Little Zhuo is getting stronger!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong had been observing the battle closely. The moment he perceived this shift, joy bloomed in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">A bystander sees things more clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sun Lingtong clearly noticed: Ning Zhuo's improvement was visibly significant while fighting Chen Lingfeng one-on-one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">It wasn’t just that he had become adept at controlling his mechanical constructs - his various mechanical techniques and Five Element spells were all becoming more and more proficient in his hands. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">His timing in using them was also getting better and better.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo was like a piece of jade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Under immense pressure, he was being relentlessly polished. As the saying goes, “Jade must be carved to become a gem” - and this piece of jade, Ning Zhuo, was finally beginning to shine with a brilliance of his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Little Zhuo’s accumulation has reached a critical step - he’s undergoing a qualitative transformation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, even though he kept a low profile, he always studied diligently. And with me giving him pointers, his foundational skills became rock-solid.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“Since leaving the mountain to journey across the world, he has never slacked in his cultivation, constantly practicing with tireless dedication. Though he hasn’t had much time to divide among everything, he’s been using real combat as training.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Especially during his time in the army - he’s fought countless battles, large and small. That’s been an intense training ground for him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“And now, finally, his accumulated progress has reached the tipping point - it’s beginning to elevate!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong was sincerely happy for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Wind Movement - Wind Erosion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Chen Lingfeng’s unease grew stronger. He puffed out his cheeks and blew out a fierce blast of yellow wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The yellow wind howled - impossible to defend against. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Everything it touched disintegrated into powder, scattered like smoke and dust. Its power was utterly terrifying!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Just like weathering by wind, the stone slab shields Ning Zhuo had erected around himself all turned to sand and scattered into nothingness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Next, the three-layered Fiery Fire Barriers around him flickered like dying candlelight in a storm, and then vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Even the thick layer of Earth Armor clinging to his body immediately began to weather away, cracking apart in chunks and disintegrating, revealing the inner layer beneath...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">-Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">This mechanical armor stood firm and unmoved, glowing faintly with Buddhist light, displaying its formidable defensive power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo couldn’t unleash the Mystic Gold Slash - several of his defensive spells had been broken, and his spiritual power had been drained significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">If he forcefully unleashed the Mystic Gold Slash now, it would no doubt drain all his spiritual energy!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">In this kind of situation, the better option was to activate a magical tool or magical artifact - that would save far more spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Foundation Establishment cultivators generally relied on magical tools. Even though Ning Zhuo now had Golden Core-level combat power, he was still fundamentally different from a true Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">And that difference… lay exactly here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">His spiritual energy hadn’t undergone the fundamental transformation that came with forming a golden core. If he used a magical treasure, the consumption would be enormous - practically no different from forcefully casting the Mystic Gold Slash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">So, Ning Zhuo chose to use a magical tool instead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">With a wave of his hand, a barrage of Thunder Beads rained down around Chen Lingfeng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Boom! Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Consumable magical tools often unleashed fierce power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The chain of explosions sent thick clouds of dust and smoke rolling across that section of the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">But the next moment, a howling gust swept through, dispersing the smog and revealing Chen Lingfeng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He looked a bit worse for wear, but on closer inspection, it was clear he hadn’t suffered any real injuries - just a rather disheveled appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Still, Ning Zhuo had achieved what he wanted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">By spending those Thunder Beads, he had successfully interrupted Chen Lingfeng’s spellcasting, forcing the cessation of that highly dangerous Erosion spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">In the very next moment, the Nightblade Shadow Tiger emerged!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ghostclaw Strike!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">A vicious claw stabbed straight into Chen Lingfeng’s back, and in an instant, blood sprayed forth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Puff, puff - two more stabbing strikes in quick succession pierced all the way to the bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Once he activated his innate talent, Chen Lingfeng had to abandon all forms of defense to allow the wind to rise within his bones and flow outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Ahhh!” Chen Lingfeng howled toward the sky. A violent wind burst from inside him, blasting outward and forcefully blowing the Nightblade Shadow Tiger away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity to close in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">The Heavily-Armored Blood Ape Yuan Dasheng charged at the forefront, clearing the path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Nightblade Shadow Tiger pounced once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Chen Lingfeng’s eyes were blood-red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Windstride - Gale Sphere Spiral!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">A tornado erupted, rapidly expanding to engulf Ning Zhuo and the various constructs around him. Then, it suddenly contracted, forming a massive emerald wind sphere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Using the last shred of his sanity, Chen Lingfeng raised both hands, lifting the wind sphere into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Then, with the area around him cleared out, Chen Lingfeng completely lost control and fell into a frenzied state. Friend or foe - it didn’t matter anymore. He began attacking wildly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Overextending one’s innate talent for too long would always lead to consequences like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo had, through his own strength alone, driven Chen Lingfeng mad!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">And now, Chen Lingfeng had brought chaos to the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“Damn it. He’s fully unleashed his innate talent - Chen Lingfeng might be just a Golden Core cultivator, but he can match a Nascent Soul!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“We can’t deal with him now - retreat first.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"The cultivators familiar with the intel all began to retreat, doing their utmost to distance themselves from Chen Lingfeng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Even Nascent Soul–level cultivators were no exception."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The wind sphere carried Ning Zhuo, flying across the battlefield for a distance before finally dispersing in midair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Only then did Ning Zhuo regain his freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">He and his mechanical constructs had just landed when a massive figure struck at him-</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The Elephant King, Xiang Yue!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
