<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The barbarian Golden Core led his subordinates and fought against Ning Zhuo‚Äôs mechanical army for a while. Realizing the latter‚Äôs might, he decisively retreated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong controlled the mechanical puppets and took the opportunity to pursue, killing many barbarian cultivators. Then they saw their opponents dashing all the way down the mountain along the slope.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong transmitted his voice with divine sense, ‚ÄúShould we continue chasing?‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took one glance at the battlefield at the foot of the mountain. The people from the Three Generals Battalion were far fewer in number than the enemy army, and they were close to being surrounded.<br/>
<br/>
He made a quick decision and gritted his teeth. ‚ÄúNo! Let‚Äôs first destroy this enemy camp.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, the barbarian Golden Core who wielded a spear had overestimated himself. He led his troops out, only to be routed by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The enemy camp was still intact, and there were still some barbarian soldiers who kept shooting arrows in Ning Zhuo‚Äôs direction.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo led the mechanical puppets to the gates of the enemy camp but suddenly halted.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, the advantage of having obedient and disciplined mechanical puppets was fully displayed.<br/>
<br/>
If it were a normal army that lacked sufficient training and discipline, some soldiers would certainly have grown too excited to obey the sudden order to stop and would have continued to charge forward.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúLittle Zhuo?‚Äù Sun Lingtong felt puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo withdrew his gaze from the mechanical ring. Just now, his mechanical ring had constricted slightly. Although the movement was very slight, it still served as a warning to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo activated both his mind and divine sense, splitting off fifty mechanical puppets from the main force and sending them into the enemy camp.<br/>
<br/>
There were only a few barbarian soldiers inside the enemy camp, all of whom were old, weak, or wounded.<br/>
<br/>
In the final moments of their lives, they showed great valor, shouting as they rushed forward, only to be mercilessly killed by the mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
But as the barbarian soldiers died, a formation in the camp revealed itself and activated with great speed.<br/>
<br/>
Neither Sun Ning nor Ning Zhuo could identify the origin of this formation. They saw that its patterns and talismans were all in some ancient, archaic script.<br/>
<br/>
Having been fueled by blood sacrifice, the formation erupted with waves of purple-black smoke. The smoke instantly encircled nearly fifty mechanical puppets.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo tried to control them, but the difficulty soared.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, the purple-black smoke began to move without any wind, swiftly drifting toward Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo dared not be careless. He decisively withdrew his divine sense and refrained from using the Buddha Heart-Demon Seal to sense the mechanical puppets in the camp.<br/>
<br/>
The purple-black smoke suddenly lost its target and dispersed midway.<br/>
<br/>
To be safe, Ning Zhuo immediately maneuvered the remaining three hundred or so mechanical puppets to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
The purple-black smoke engulfed the entire camp, then shifted again toward Ning Zhuo‚Äôs direction.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how Ning Zhuo maneuvered his army, the purple-black smoke would swiftly adjust and continue drifting toward him.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong activated his Heaven-Gifted Ling Eyes and observed for a moment, then half-guessed, ‚ÄúIt might be because of the connection between the troops, Little Zhuo!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Under Ning Zhuo‚Äôs command were more than four hundred mechanical puppets, all officially registered under the Twin Rivers Kingdom‚Äôs army.<br/>
<br/>
They belonged to the Red Flower Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, the Red Flower Battalion‚Äôs main force was on another route. Only Ning Zhuo‚Äôs mechanical troops were here. Thus, the purple-black smoke locked onto Ning Zhuo and drew ever closer to him.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs easy to handle!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and clapped his palms together in front of his chest, producing a crisp snap.<br/>
<br/>
He roused his entire body‚Äôs spiritual energy, simultaneously mobilizing his military force. He was about to cast his most adept Tree Realm Descent.<br/>
<br/>
But after a moment‚Äôs thought, he immediately switched to a fire-based spell.<br/>
<br/>
Fire Element ‚ÄîNine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Godly fire descended from the nine heavens, blazing fiercely, the fire dragons scorching evil!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo chanted in a low voice at great speed.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, over half of his spiritual energy and military power were consumed, turning into three fire dragons that charged into the enemy camp shrouded by the purple-black smoke.<br/>
<br/>
With the roar of dragons, blazing flames spread rapidly, engulfing the entire enemy camp!<br/>
<br/>
The Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique was one of the most classic spells of the fire element, famed throughout the cultivation world. The spell simulated heavenly fire from the nine skies, condensing into the form of fire dragons to be controlled in battle.<br/>
<br/>
The number of fire dragons would increase according to the cultivation level of the caster.<br/>
<br/>
At the Qi Refinement stage, only one fire dragon could be summoned. At the Foundation Establishment stage, there would be two. Although Ning Zhuo was currently at the Foundation Establishment stage, he possessed Golden Core-level combat power, so he managed to condense three.<br/>
<br/>
One reason that the Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique was such a classic of the fire element was that it was commonly used at a cultivator‚Äôs early, middle, and even later stages of the Dao path.<br/>
<br/>
Once successfully cultivated, it was often used for an entire lifetime!<br/>
<br/>
The purple-black smoke was burned away by the flames, which rose to the sky and turned the camp into a sea of fire.<br/>
<br/>
Within the sea of flames, the tents, weapons, war chariots, and so forth were quickly reduced to ash. Even the ground itself was scorched until it turned a shade of red, becoming a glass-like solid.<br/>
<br/>
The entire enemy camp looked like a gigantic furnace. Fiery flames shot skyward, lighting up the night sky in brilliant red.<br/>
<br/>
Waves of heat rolled out incessantly. The air twisted and rippled. Even the rocks and trees in the distance looked blurred, as if they might melt at any moment.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
A violent explosion suddenly burst forth from the enemy camp.<br/>
<br/>
The barbarian Golden Core wielding a spear wore a gloomy expression. The two-layered trap he had painstakingly set up in the camp had both failed.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúDamn it! I just had to run into a mechanical army,‚Äù the spear-wielding Golden Core said, filled with irrepressible resentment.<br/>
<br/>
His gaze locked tightly onto Ning Zhuo, trying to imprint that enemy‚Äôs image deep into his mind.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, Ning Zhuo was containing the sea of fire, letting it burn only the enemy camp, without spreading to the forested mountains and leaving the entire Heavenly Pillar Giantwood Mountain in ruins.<br/>
<br/>
He wore white robes and had black hair, standing on the mountainside, looking down at the foot of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Under the glow of the flames, his figure was elongated, projected against the distant cliff like a dark deity.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo‚Äôs lofty bearing, the spear-wielding Golden Core felt his heart waver.<br/>
<br/>
His mouth was full of bitterness as he thought, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just a Foundation Establishment cultivator, while I am a dignified Golden Core.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúWe lost this battle because the Twin Rivers Kingdom‚Äôs army is too powerful. We‚Äôve already mobilized local barbarian tribes from various mountaintops and trained them in advance.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúBut our tribes do not cooperate well, and there are too many internal conflicts. How can our formation match that of the Twin Rivers Kingdom?‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúThat said, the idea of this mechanical army is really good. The actual combat effect is quite impressive. Thousand Peaks Forest ought to create some of these as well.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
After destroying the enemy camp on the mountainside, Ning Zhuo quickly inspected his mechanical army.<br/>
<br/>
Originally, there were over four hundred mechanical puppets. After that recent battle, nearly a hundred were lost, leaving a bit more than three hundred.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúAt least twenty-some thousand mid-grade spirit stones were lost,‚Äù Ning Zhuo estimated his losses.<br/>
<br/>
Such a loss would be like half a year‚Äôs income for an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúI spent over twenty thousand mid-grade spirit stones for my current Golden Core-level combat power.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs actually a pretty good deal!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, Ning Zhuo suddenly had a new realization.<br/>
<br/>
The essence of the so-called Hundred Arts of Cultivation was, in truth, the pursuit of cost-effectiveness‚Äîusing ever more ingenious methods to utilize resources and achieve greater results.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivation‚Äôs Hundred Arts resembled a lever. The more profound and mysterious the skill, the fewer and cheaper the resources needed to exert greater and stronger power.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo surveyed the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong‚Äôs reconnaissance and the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon‚Äôs scouting both informed him that there were no other ambushes nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Without changing his expression, Ning Zhuo led his mechanical army down to the foot of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical army poured down like a long river.<br/>
<br/>
The spear-wielding Golden Core led part of the remaining troops and launched ranged attacks on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Under the effect of the Lightfoot Gale Formation, Ning Zhuo‚Äôs mechanical army moved lightly and swiftly, evading much of the attack. They charged to the side of the Three Generals Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
The dual-axe Golden Core, who was in the midst of besieging the Three Generals Battalion, became so enraged that he started cursing.<br/>
<br/>
He was furious that the spear-wielding Golden Core had performed poorly, failing to stop Ning Zhuo, which resulted in Ning Zhuo reaching him from behind. This created a scenario in which Ning Zhuo‚Äôs mechanical army and the Three Generals Battalion could pincer him from inside and out.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúHurry and support me!‚Äù the dual-axe Golden Core shouted at the spear-wielding Golden Core.<br/>
<br/>
The spear-wielding Golden Core had retreated to protect the people of his tribe.<br/>
<br/>
His tribe did not have many members to begin with. Those who were with him now were the seeds of his tribe‚Äôs future, so he could not afford to lose them.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, he had issued the order to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
But now, if Ning Zhuo and the Three Generals Battalion succeeded in their inside-out pincer attack, that would be something the spear-wielding Golden Core also did not want to see.<br/>
<br/>
He gritted his teeth and led his subordinates in an urgent charge.<br/>
<br/>
The dual-axe barbarian Golden Core shouted loudly to rally morale, ‚ÄúCome on, boys, hold on! Don‚Äôt give in!!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
He also cheered himself on in his heart, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be fine. We can hold out. We have the Wasteland Hunting Formation!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
The barbarians did have battle formations.<br/>
<br/>
These battle formations had a long history, passed down through the ages.<br/>
<br/>
The Wasteland Hunting Formation was a classic example.<br/>
<br/>
As its name suggested, it leaned toward hunting and offense rather than defense.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not hesitate or pause. He led the mechanical army straight into the enemy formation.<br/>
<br/>
The barbarian battle formation withstood for several dozen breaths before failing to hold out. The mechanical army violently pushed, ground through them, causing heavy casualties, breaching their lines and killing their way in!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs repeated spellcasting was a major reason they succeeded in breaking through.<br/>
<br/>
He did not care about the life and death of his mechanical puppets‚Äîwell, mechanical puppets did not have life or death in the first place‚Äîbut barbarian cultivators were different, being flesh and blood.<br/>
<br/>
They died under wave after wave of Ning Zhuo‚Äôs five-element spells, meeting a tragic end.<br/>
<br/>
It was the first time Ning Zhuo fully experienced what it was like to lead troops in battle.<br/>
<br/>
This was a completely new and unique feeling for him, stirring his inner emotions.<br/>
<br/>
When he clashed with the spear-wielding cultivator‚Äôs army, the pressure he felt had been like a bowl of thin porridge.<br/>
<br/>
Fighting against the dual-axe Golden Core‚Äôs subordinates increased the pressure significantly, but even so, it was merely like going from thin porridge to cooked rice.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúWithout sufficient training, the soldiers come from complex backgrounds and harbor grudges among themselves. They can‚Äôt unite as one. As a result, though they have many people, their overall military force is lacking.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúIn contrast, my side‚Äôs Three Generals Battalion is far better trained, not to mention my mechanical army, which carries out every command without fail.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúMore crucially, there is a disparity in national power.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs mechanical army, along with Liu, Guan, and Zhang‚Äôs Three Generals Battalion, all had the kingdom‚Äôs power supporting them.<br/>
<br/>
Yet the Thousand Peaks Forest region had not established a kingdom, so their troops only had military strength, lacking national might.<br/>
<br/>
It was not that Ginsengbeard Dragon King refused to build a kingdom; rather, founding a kingdom was extremely difficult. Even a Nascent Soul or a Soul Formation cultivator dared not try lightly.<br/>
<br/>
To found a kingdom, one needed to meet at least three criteria: national destiny, a national artifact, and a rightful king.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, the king had to possess the Royal Mandate. This alone disqualified countless ambitious figures.<br/>
<br/>
The barbarian army, now caught in a pincer, was in dire straits.<br/>
<br/>
Even though the spear-wielding Golden Core rushed over to help, it was too late.<br/>
<br/>
Furious, the dual-axe Golden Core gave up attacking the Three Generals Battalion and turned around to assault Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Generals Battalion seized this opportunity and swiftly changed their formation!<br/>
<br/>
All their round-the-clock drilling bore fruit at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
They swiftly shifted from the Triangular Arrow formation into the Iron Barrel formation.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, while resting in Green Forest Immortal City, the Three Generals Battalion had used the time to train frenetically, enabling their troops to master another battle formation.<br/>
<br/>
And this battle formation happened to be a classic defensive formation.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang had thus been freed. In the Triangular Arrow formation, all three of them had to stay in the vital positions and the heart of the formation at all times.<br/>
<br/>
But the Iron Barrel formation only needed one person to stay long-term as the main anchor.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei and Guan Hong were thus liberated‚Äîlike a black tiger freed from its cage, like a crimson dragon breaking its chains‚Äîand they charged forth.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the barbarian side was not limited to just two Golden Cores; there were other Golden Core cultivators. Seeing Guan and Zhang dash out, they intervened midway to stop them.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei unleashed the Black Waves Overwhelming skill and relied on his inborn talent of Mighty Python Tendons, plus the Black Serpent Spear. The more he fought, the stronger he became, and the more ferocious his attacks grew.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong activated the Crimson-Faced Blood Calamity Scripture and wielded the Blood Dragon Blade. Suddenly, he unleashed a strategic maneuver ‚ÄîSingle Blade Charge!<br/>
<br/>
Blood surged, transforming into a blade radiance that directly pierced through the barbarian army.<br/>
<br/>
One barbarian Golden Core roared and lunged at Guan Hong.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong did not dodge. His long beard, eight feet in length, suddenly glowed red under the bloody light.<br/>
<br/>
Heaven-Gifted Ability ‚ÄîA Thousand Beards Reflecting Blood!<br/>
<br/>
The crimson glow was both offensive and defensive, shining forth like a raging blood-colored river. It swept up one barbarian Golden Core.<br/>
<br/>
That barbarian Golden Core let out a terrified scream, but after a few breaths, he was reduced to a pool of blood.<br/>
<br/>
The large amount of essence in that blood was immediately devoured by Guan Hong‚Äôs crimson light.<br/>
<br/>
This was the defining characteristic of demonic arts‚Äîusing other cultivators as resources.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong swiftly killed one barbarian Golden Core, and Ning Zhuo‚Äôs five-element spell injured another.<br/>
<br/>
During that time, the spear-wielding Golden Core tried to launch a surprise attack but was forced back by a single Metal Element spell from Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
He was knocked back, his eyelids twitching. It was all because of the ferocity that Ning Zhuo demonstrated. One could not help but feel dread at the ruthless barrage of spells raining down without distinction, killing many of his own mechanical puppets in the process.<br/>
<br/>
Even their ally, Liu Er, was left marveling at Ning Zhuo‚Äôs combat style. ‚ÄúHe truly lives up to being a child of a great clan. He must be losing a ton of mechanical puppets‚Äîimagine how much that costs!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er, holding the Xuanhuang Sword, continued to maintain the Iron Barrel formation without launching an active attack.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúDie!‚Äù In the heat of the fierce battle, Zhang Hei suddenly let out a roar, causing the Golden Core opponent to fall into a brief stupor.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the Black Serpent Spear pierced through the enemy‚Äôs heart. Zhang Hei reached out and grabbed the Golden Core cultivator‚Äôs head in his palm, then squeezed hard. Like a watermelon bursting, it exploded in his grasp.<br/>
<br/>
The second barbarian Golden Core perished!<br/>
<br/>
The barbarian army‚Äôs formation was broken, and they suffered backlash. Seeing Zhang Hei and Guan Hong so terrifyingly fierce, their fighting spirit plummeted.<br/>
<br/>
Sensing their overall military might fading drastically, the remaining barbarian Golden Cores conferred briefly and could only concede defeat, choosing to retreat up the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Ning, Guan, and Zhang seized the opportunity to press the attack, inflicting countless casualties.</div>
