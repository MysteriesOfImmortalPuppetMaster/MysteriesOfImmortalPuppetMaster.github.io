<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The barbarian Golden Core led his subordinates and fought against Ning Zhuo’s mechanical army for a while. Realizing the latter’s might, he decisively retreated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong controlled the mechanical puppets and took the opportunity to pursue, killing many barbarian cultivators. Then they saw their opponents dashing all the way down the mountain along the slope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Sun Lingtong transmitted his voice with divine sense, “Should we continue chasing?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo took one glance at the battlefield at the foot of the mountain. The people from the Three Generals Battalion were far fewer in number than the enemy army, and they were close to being surrounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He made a quick decision and gritted his teeth. “No! Let’s first destroy this enemy camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Earlier, the barbarian Golden Core who wielded a spear had overestimated himself. He led his troops out, only to be routed by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The enemy camp was still intact, and there were still some barbarian soldiers who kept shooting arrows in Ning Zhuo’s direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo led the mechanical puppets to the gates of the enemy camp but suddenly halted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">At that moment, the advantage of having obedient and disciplined mechanical puppets was fully displayed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">If it were a normal army that lacked sufficient training and discipline, some soldiers would certainly have grown too excited to obey the sudden order to stop and would have continued to charge forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Little Zhuo?” Sun Lingtong felt puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo withdrew his gaze from the mechanical ring. Just now, his mechanical ring had constricted slightly. Although the movement was very slight, it still served as a warning to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo activated both his mind and divine sense, splitting off fifty mechanical puppets from the main force and sending them into the enemy camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">There were only a few barbarian soldiers inside the enemy camp, all of whom were old, weak, or wounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In the final moments of their lives, they showed great valor, shouting as they rushed forward, only to be mercilessly killed by the mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But as the barbarian soldiers died, a formation in the camp revealed itself and activated with great speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Neither Sun Ning nor Ning Zhuo could identify the origin of this formation. They saw that its patterns and talismans were all in some ancient, archaic script.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Having been fueled by blood sacrifice, the formation erupted with waves of purple-black smoke. The smoke instantly encircled nearly fifty mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo tried to control them, but the difficulty soared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">At the same time, the purple-black smoke began to move without any wind, swiftly drifting toward Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo dared not be careless. He decisively withdrew his divine sense and refrained from using the Buddha Heart-Demon Seal to sense the mechanical puppets in the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The purple-black smoke suddenly lost its target and dispersed midway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">To be safe, Ning Zhuo immediately maneuvered the remaining three hundred or so mechanical puppets to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The purple-black smoke engulfed the entire camp, then shifted again toward Ning Zhuo’s direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">No matter how Ning Zhuo maneuvered his army, the purple-black smoke would swiftly adjust and continue drifting toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun Lingtong activated his Heaven-Gifted Ling Eyes and observed for a moment, then half-guessed, “It might be because of the connection between the troops, Little Zhuo!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Under Ning Zhuo’s command were more than four hundred mechanical puppets, all officially registered under the Two Note Kingdom’s army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">They belonged to the Red Flower Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">At the moment, the Red Flower Battalion’s main force was on another route. Only Ning Zhuo’s mechanical troops were here. Thus, the purple-black smoke locked onto Ning Zhuo and drew ever closer to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“If that’s the case, it’s easy to handle!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and clapped his palms together in front of his chest, producing a crisp snap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He roused his entire body’s spiritual energy, simultaneously mobilizing his military force. He was about to cast his most adept Tree Realm Descent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">But after a moment’s thought, he immediately switched to a fire-based spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Fire Element —Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Godly fire descended from the nine heavens, blazing fiercely, the fire dragons scorching evil!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo chanted in a low voice at great speed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">In the next moment, over half of his spiritual energy and military power were consumed, turning into three fire dragons that charged into the enemy camp shrouded by the purple-black smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">With the roar of dragons, blazing flames spread rapidly, engulfing the entire enemy camp!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique was one of the most classic spells of the fire element, famed throughout the cultivation world. The spell simulated heavenly fire from the nine skies, condensing into the form of fire dragons to be controlled in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The number of fire dragons would increase according to the cultivation level of the caster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">At the Qi Refinement stage, only one fire dragon could be summoned. At the Foundation Establishment stage, there would be two. Although Ning Zhuo was currently at the Foundation Establishment stage, he possessed Golden Core-level combat power, so he managed to condense three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">One reason that the Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique was such a classic of the fire element was that it was commonly used at a cultivator’s early, middle, and even later stages of the Dao path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Once successfully cultivated, it was often used for an entire lifetime!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The purple-black smoke was burned away by the flames, which rose to the sky and turned the camp into a sea of fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Within the sea of flames, the tents, weapons, war chariots, and so forth were quickly reduced to ash. Even the ground itself was scorched until it turned a shade of red, becoming a glass-like solid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The entire enemy camp looked like a gigantic furnace. Fiery flames shot skyward, lighting up the night sky in brilliant red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Waves of heat rolled out incessantly. The air twisted and rippled. Even the rocks and trees in the distance looked blurred, as if they might melt at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">A violent explosion suddenly burst forth from the enemy camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The barbarian Golden Core wielding a spear wore a gloomy expression. The two-layered trap he had painstakingly set up in the camp had both failed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Damn it! I just had to run into a mechanical army,” the spear-wielding Golden Core said, filled with irrepressible resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">His gaze locked tightly onto Ning Zhuo, trying to imprint that enemy’s image deep into his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">At that moment, Ning Zhuo was containing the sea of fire, letting it burn only the enemy camp, without spreading to the forested mountains and leaving the entire Heavenly Pillar Giantwood Mountain in ruins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He wore white robes and had black hair, standing on the mountainside, looking down at the foot of the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Under the glow of the flames, his figure was elongated, projected against the distant cliff like a dark deity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Seeing Ning Zhuo’s lofty bearing, the spear-wielding Golden Core felt his heart waver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">His mouth was full of bitterness as he thought, “He’s just a Foundation Establishment cultivator, while I am a dignified Golden Core.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“We lost this battle because the Two Note Kingdom’s army is too powerful. We’ve already mobilized local barbarian tribes from various mountaintops and trained them in advance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“But our tribes do not cooperate well, and there are too many internal conflicts. How can our formation match that of the Two Note Kingdom?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“That said, the idea of this mechanical army is really good. The actual combat effect is quite impressive. Thousand Peaks Forest ought to create some of these as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">After destroying the enemy camp on the mountainside, Ning Zhuo quickly inspected his mechanical army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Originally, there were over four hundred mechanical puppets. After that recent battle, nearly a hundred were lost, leaving a bit more than three hundred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“At least twenty-some thousand mid-grade spirit stones were lost,” Ning Zhuo estimated his losses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Such a loss would be like half a year’s income for an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“I spent over twenty thousand mid-grade spirit stones for my current Golden Core-level combat power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“That’s actually a pretty good deal!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">At that moment, Ning Zhuo suddenly had a new realization.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The essence of the so-called Hundred Arts of Cultivation was, in truth, the pursuit of cost-effectiveness—using ever more ingenious methods to utilize resources and achieve greater results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Cultivation’s Hundred Arts resembled a lever. The more profound and mysterious the skill, the fewer and cheaper the resources needed to exert greater and stronger power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo surveyed the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Sun Lingtong’s reconnaissance and the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon’s scouting both informed him that there were no other ambushes nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Without changing his expression, Ning Zhuo led his mechanical army down to the foot of the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The mechanical army poured down like a long river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The spear-wielding Golden Core led part of the remaining troops and launched ranged attacks on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Under the effect of the Light Body Swift Wind Formation, Ning Zhuo’s mechanical army moved lightly and swiftly, evading much of the attack. They charged to the side of the Three Generals Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The dual-axe Golden Core, who was in the midst of besieging the Three Generals Battalion, became so enraged that he started cursing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He was furious that the spear-wielding Golden Core had performed poorly, failing to stop Ning Zhuo, which resulted in Ning Zhuo reaching him from behind. This created a scenario in which Ning Zhuo’s mechanical army and the Three Generals Battalion could pincer him from inside and out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Hurry and support me!” the dual-axe Golden Core shouted at the spear-wielding Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The spear-wielding Golden Core had retreated to protect the people of his tribe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">His tribe did not have many members to begin with. Those who were with him now were the seeds of his tribe’s future, so he could not afford to lose them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Therefore, he had issued the order to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">But now, if Ning Zhuo and the Three Generals Battalion succeeded in their inside-out pincer attack, that would be something the spear-wielding Golden Core also did not want to see.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He gritted his teeth and led his subordinates in an urgent charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The dual-axe barbarian Golden Core shouted loudly to rally morale, “Come on, boys, hold on! Don’t give in!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He also cheered himself on in his heart, “We’ll be fine. We can hold out. We have the Wasteland Hunting Formation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The barbarians did have battle formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">These battle formations had a long history, passed down through the ages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Wasteland Hunting Formation was a classic example.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">As its name suggested, it leaned toward hunting and offense rather than defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo did not hesitate or pause. He led the mechanical army straight into the enemy formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The barbarian battle formation withstood for several dozen breaths before failing to hold out. The mechanical army violently pushed, ground through them, causing heavy casualties, breaching their lines and killing their way in!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo’s repeated spellcasting was a major reason they succeeded in breaking through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He did not care about the life and death of his mechanical puppets—well, mechanical puppets did not have life or death in the first place—but barbarian cultivators were different, being flesh and blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">They died under wave after wave of Ning Zhuo’s five-element spells, meeting a tragic end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">It was the first time Ning Zhuo fully experienced what it was like to lead troops in battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">This was a completely new and unique feeling for him, stirring his inner emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">When he clashed with the spear-wielding cultivator’s army, the pressure he felt had been like a bowl of thin porridge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Fighting against the dual-axe Golden Core’s subordinates increased the pressure significantly, but even so, it was merely like going from thin porridge to cooked rice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“Without sufficient training, the soldiers come from complex backgrounds and harbor grudges among themselves. They can’t unite as one. As a result, though they have many people, their overall military force is lacking.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“In contrast, my side’s Three Generals Battalion is far better trained, not to mention my mechanical army, which carries out every command without fail.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“More crucially, there is a disparity in national power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo’s mechanical army, along with Liu, Guan, and Zhang’s Three Generals Battalion, all had the kingdom’s power supporting them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Yet the Thousand Peaks Forest region had not established a kingdom, so their troops only had military strength, lacking national might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">It was not that Ginsengbeard Dragon King refused to build a kingdom; rather, founding a kingdom was extremely difficult. Even a Nascent Soul or a Soul Formation cultivator dared not try lightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">To found a kingdom, one needed to meet at least three criteria: national destiny, a national artifact, and a rightful king.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Usually, the king had to possess the Royal Mandate. This alone disqualified countless ambitious figures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The barbarian army, now caught in a pincer, was in dire straits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Even though the spear-wielding Golden Core rushed over to help, it was too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Furious, the dual-axe Golden Core gave up attacking the Three Generals Battalion and turned around to assault Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Three Generals Battalion seized this opportunity and swiftly changed their formation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">All their round-the-clock drilling bore fruit at that moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">They swiftly shifted from the Triangular Arrow formation into the Iron Barrel formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Indeed, while resting in Green Forest Immortal City, the Three Generals Battalion had used the time to train frenetically, enabling their troops to master another battle formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">And this battle formation happened to be a classic defensive formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Liu, Guan, and Zhang had thus been freed. In the Triangular Arrow formation, all three of them had to stay in the vital positions and the heart of the formation at all times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">But the Iron Barrel formation only needed one person to stay long-term as the main anchor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Zhang Hei and Guan Hong were thus liberated—like a black tiger freed from its cage, like a crimson dragon breaking its chains—and they charged forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Of course, the barbarian side was not limited to just two Golden Cores; there were other Golden Core cultivators. Seeing Guan and Zhang dash out, they intervened midway to stop them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Zhang Hei unleashed the Black Waves Overwhelming skill and relied on his inborn talent of Mighty Python Tendons, plus the Black Serpent Spear. The more he fought, the stronger he became, and the more ferocious his attacks grew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Guan Hong activated the Crimson-Faced Blood Calamity Scripture and wielded the Blood Dragon Blade. Suddenly, he unleashed a strategic maneuver —Single Blade Charge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Blood surged, transforming into a blade radiance that directly pierced through the barbarian army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">One barbarian Golden Core roared and lunged at Guan Hong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Guan Hong did not dodge. His long beard, eight feet in length, suddenly glowed red under the bloody light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Heaven-Gifted Ability —A Thousand Beards Reflecting Blood!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The crimson glow was both offensive and defensive, shining forth like a raging blood-colored river. It swept up one barbarian Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">That barbarian Golden Core let out a terrified scream, but after a few breaths, he was reduced to a pool of blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The large amount of essence in that blood was immediately devoured by Guan Hong’s crimson light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">This was the defining characteristic of demonic arts—using other cultivators as resources.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Guan Hong swiftly killed one barbarian Golden Core, and Ning Zhuo’s five-element spell injured another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">During that time, the spear-wielding Golden Core tried to launch a surprise attack but was forced back by a single Metal Element spell from Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">He was knocked back, his eyelids twitching. It was all because of the ferocity that Ning Zhuo demonstrated. One could not help but feel dread at the ruthless barrage of spells raining down without distinction, killing many of his own mechanical puppets in the process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Even their ally, Liu Er, was left marveling at Ning Zhuo’s combat style. “He truly lives up to being a child of a great clan. He must be losing a ton of mechanical puppets—imagine how much that costs!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Liu Er, holding the Xuanhuang Sword, continued to maintain the Iron Barrel formation without launching an active attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">“Die!” In the heat of the fierce battle, Zhang Hei suddenly let out a roar, causing the Golden Core opponent to fall into a brief stupor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">In an instant, the Black Serpent Spear pierced through the enemy’s heart. Zhang Hei reached out and grabbed the Golden Core cultivator’s head in his palm, then squeezed hard. Like a watermelon bursting, it exploded in his grasp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The second barbarian Golden Core perished!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The barbarian army’s formation was broken, and they suffered backlash. Seeing Zhang Hei and Guan Hong so terrifyingly fierce, their fighting spirit plummeted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Sensing their overall military might fading drastically, the remaining barbarian Golden Cores conferred briefly and could only concede defeat, choosing to retreat up the mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning, Guan, and Zhang seized the opportunity to press the attack, inflicting countless casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
