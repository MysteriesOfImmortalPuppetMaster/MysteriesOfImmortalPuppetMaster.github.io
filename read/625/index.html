<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo listened intently, murmuring as he softly repeated the key points: "First, find the critical weakness. Second, strike it using Confucian methods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"How do I find the critical weakness? What specific Confucian methods should I use? Can I learn them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo's curiosity for new things was insatiable; he wanted to master all hundred arts of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Wen Ruanyu couldn't help but ask, "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, why do you take this so seriously? Is there truly a ritual you need to disrupt?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Is it connected to White Paper Immortal City and the Ghost Tide?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "Senior Wen, thank you for your concern. This is a personal matter. Please teach me! If you have any requests, feel free to make them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Wen Ruanyu shook his head. "You're Senior Sister Meng's child. I should be the one looking after you, not demanding compensation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Though incomplete, this sacrificial rite's quality is high. Facing it alone would be too arduous and dangerous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"If you need my help, just say the word!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo once again declined with tact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He had to handle this himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Wen Ruanyu seemed trustworthy, and even the White Paper City Lord had a stake in the matter. But Ning Zhuo refused to seek their assistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The reason was simple - Meng Yaoyin had concealed everything, not just from the White Paper City Lord, but from the Myriad Manifestations Sect as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Mother must have her reasons for this. I've been in White Paper Immortal City for too short a time, still an outsider. Until I uncover why she arranged things this way, it's best to follow established procedures."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"In truth, even if they knew this secret, they couldn't help much. The city's defenses alone require their full attention."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Seeing Ning Zhuo's stance, Wen Ruanyu abandoned his insistence and instead explained the method in detail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"To locate the central position, it's actually quite simple - use Literary Qi."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"When Literary Qi reaches a certain threshold, it naturally attracts and competes with itself. This is the principle of Literary Talent's mutual appreciation and rivalry."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"This contains my accumulated Literary Qi. Take it; follow its guidance to find the central position."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">As he spoke, Wen Ruanyu produced a small storage pouch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The white storage pouch, translucent like frosted glass, held a swirling mass of Literary Qi. It emitted a luminous snow-white glow that illuminated the surroundings through the pouch's walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Wen Ruanyu spoke with a hint of pride, "This is a Literary Light Reflecting Snow Pouch. If a Confucian cultivator lacks sufficient literary talent, even if they accumulate literary qi, no snow light will shine through. Therefore, during Confucian gatherings, cultivators often compare their Reflecting Snow Pouches."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo immediately offered praise, his words bringing a smile to Wen Ruanyu's face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">After putting away the Reflecting Snow Pouch, Ning Zhuo asked which Confucian methods should be used to destroy the central mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Wen Ruanyu pondered briefly before saying, "I've thought of six methods that could destroy the central mechanism."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"I can learn all of them!" Ning Zhuo said. "But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Wen Ruanyu deeply gazed at Ning Zhuo. "But you're short on time, aren't you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo nodded calmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Wen Ruanyu sighed. "You're just like your mother, always wanting to shoulder the heaviest responsibilities. Very well, since time is pressing, there's only one method most suitable for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"This Confucian technique is called Scholar Meets Soldier. Though it's a Confucian technique, it uses baleful energy to counteract other Confucian techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo's pupils contracted slightly, a prickling sensation spreading across his scalp!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Wen Ruanyu wasted no time and immediately began teaching the technique. "It's the simplest among all methods, easiest to master quickly. However, each use consumes substantial baleful energy, making it suitable for some Confucian generals."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo skimmed through the text and found that Wen Ruanyu's words held no falsehood. His heart trembled as he contemplated:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">I had previously selected Burden-Bearing Tactics and collected vast amounts of baleful energy, storing it within my body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Now this Scholar Meets Soldier Confucian technique can form an excellent pairing with Burden-Bearing Tactics!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Is this what they call the heavens' favor?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">No matter what I do, everything flows naturally, like a ship sailing with the wind!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In the Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Forgetful River Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">A subordinate hurried into the study, his expression grave. Over the past few days, a steady stream of bad news had left the entire Forgetful River Prefecture in a state of turmoil. What was once a stable and powerful prefecture now felt like a ship tossed in stormy seas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The subordinate gritted his teeth and stood at the door, reporting an urgent situation in a low voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Enter," said the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">After hearing the report, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord remained calm. "I understand. You may withdraw."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The subordinate bowed respectfully and left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord fell into deep thought. "This time it's a locust plague, leading to the burning of three million acres of Fire Grain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Which faction is behind this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"This method... it seems to be the Lord of Myriad Locusts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">This individual was a Gu Cultivator, having reached the Soul Transformation stage, and harbored a personal grudge against the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. His current attack might have been prompted by others' persuasion or his own observation of the critical moment in the Forgetful River Prefecture's affairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Very well, Lord of Myriad Locusts. I'll remember this enmity and repay it in due time." Even the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord felt pained by the loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The three million acres of Fire Good Fields represented a major resource for the Forgetful River Prefecture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">To cultivate this land, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had sacrificed over a dozen Land Gods, ensuring the fields' fertility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The soil in the Underworld is typically barren and difficult to farm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had painstakingly developed these three million acres of arable land, setting up formations to achieve Yin Extremity Generating Yang, then planted Fire Grain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">These Fire Grains possess Yang Attributes. While they might not be rare in the Living World, they are considered precious in the Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Even ghostly creatures cultivating cultivation cannot rely solely on Yin Attributes; they must balance them with Yang Attributes to maintain harmony between Yin and Yang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">As a result, these fire grains were often in short supply. After meeting the Forgetful River Prefecture's own needs, the remaining thirty percent was sold, generating profits that accounted for over ten percent of the entire Underworld's income.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Now, the Lord of Myriad Locusts had led billions of insects to devour the fire grains, sparking widespread fires that threatened to collapse this economic pillar of the Forgetful River Prefecture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord chose not to retaliate. He had already dispatched considerable forces during this period.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Since the fire grains were completely lost, there was no need to save them. The only concern was that the spreading flames might cause further damage in the surrounding areas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"We must send a capable official to handle disaster relief. Otherwise, abandoning them completely would lose the people's trust and fall into our enemies' trap."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord frowned slightly as he considered this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">His capable officials, who had originally been tasked with guarding the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual, now had to be reassigned to maintain overall stability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Just as the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord made this difficult decision, selected the candidate, and issued the order, another urgent report arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Duke Ironbone!" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord lost his composure this time, slamming his palm on the desk so hard that pens and ink scattered across the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Duke Ironbone was a former senior minister of the state. Before the previous Prefect passed away, he entrusted his position to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord and instructed him to treat the greatest contributor to the state - this very Duke Ironbone - with kindness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord agreed to this condition and indeed treated Duke Ironbone well. He gradually marginalized the Duke, pushing him away from the center of power until he finally retired to his hometown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Of course, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord hadn't forgotten to station personnel nearby to monitor Duke Ironbone's daily activities. This was because the Duke possessed both immense seniority and a Crimson Edict Iron Token bestowed by the previous Prefect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Now, Duke Ironbone had suddenly gone berserk. He slaughtered the surveillance team sent by the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, then climbed a high place and rallied his old subordinates under the banner of "restoring order."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">If this situation wasn't handled properly and allowed the rebel army to gain momentum, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's position would be severely shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"We must send a great general to oppose him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">After much deliberation, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord could only dispatch his most trusted and beloved general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This general had achieved merit by following the dragon - having climbed the ranks alongside the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord step by step to reach his current position, displaying considerable military talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">However, this talent fell short of Duke Ironbone's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The latter's military achievements were ones that none of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's subordinates could hope to match.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"You shall defend the city to the death and hold the rebel army in check until I can return with reinforcements!" the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord commanded, his instructions brimming with urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">By afternoon, a subordinate rushed in with alarming news. "My lord! Disaster! The Rolling Mud Pill has awakened and appeared in the northwest, now moving toward Nine Nether Mountain!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's expression froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Rolling Mud Pill!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">This was a mountain spirit that had become a demon, ancient beyond measure. Once merely a solitary peak, it had grown through endless consumption, devouring all in its path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Now, it had become an entire mountain range.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Yet still unsatisfied, it yearned to devour other mountains, seeking to expand its power further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Clearly, its current target was Nine Nether Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Forgetful River Prefecture was already mountain-poor, but Nine Nether Mountain's rich ore veins provided eighty percent of the entire Underworld's mineral resources!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">If the Rolling Mud Pill consumed it, the Forgetful River Prefecture would be forced into a passive position, forced to procure minerals externally in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"They want me to use the White Tiger Golden Light Seal," the Prefecture Lord muttered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">This magic treasure was one of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's most prized possessions, a true national treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Only by using this treasure in conjunction with Nine Nether Mountain's grand array could they mobilize the boundless golden qi from the ore veins. This would form a piercing assault capable of breaching the Rolling Mud Pill's mountainous body, inflicting enough pain to make it retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had seen through his enemy's scheme, but there was no choice but to comply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">That night, another subordinate came to report that a visiting card had suddenly appeared in the City Lord's Mansion's main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The card came from Zeng Jide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">This man was infamous. In life, he had been a cultivator of the Empty Sky Sect. After death, he became a soul cultivator and turned into a great bandit in the underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">His modus operandi was particularly audacious. Before every theft, he would deliver a Theft Notice to the owner, clearly stating when he would come to steal something.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Good. Even a famous rogue cultivator dares to bully me now." The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord took a deep breath, fully aware that he had been inevitably drawn into this situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">These various calamities had already drained most of his strength. Both capable subordinates and signature magic treasures had been drawn into the fray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"At least these aren't natural disasters, but man-made calamities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"All of these can be handled, or temporarily set aside. They're merely pawns meant to drain my strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"The true adversaries... Yin Jiuzhu leads the charge, followed by Bei Gu and Wuyin. I'm uncertain if the Painted Skin Rakshasa is currently wandering and unable to return in time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"These human-made calamities likely originate from these three - or perhaps four - parties."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord knew precisely which individuals bore him irreconcilable enmity, constituting genuine threats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">These were his true formidable opponents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"No, these are Underworld adversaries. There must be another human-made calamity originating from the Living World."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">As this thought crossed his mind, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord felt a sudden chill creep up his spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He immediately awoke, recognizing this as a warning from the Royal Decree!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">His position as Prefect of the Underworld was inherently tied to the Royal Decree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"By performing the Offering of Tribulation and serving the Underworld Celestial Heavens, I've provoked the Living World."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Therefore, within the Underworld, only human-made calamities obstruct my path, not natural disasters or heavenly tribulations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"But the Living World differs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Should the Living Realm's Heaven wish to confront me, natural disasters cannot reach me. Thus, it must manifest through human-made calamities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"From what I observe, this human-made calamity is no trivial matter!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">After a moment of silence, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord resolved: "We shall consult the Ash Bone Elder. We'll promise substantial rewards - whatever it takes - to determine the human calamity afflicting the Living World!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">In the Living World:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Ning Zhuo roused Li Xiangshang from his slumber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The cultivator emerged from the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, gently patting its hull in gratitude. "What a remarkable treasure," he murmured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Young Master Jiao Ma, this vessel clearly requires extensive repairs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The boat's hull bore numerous cracks and fissures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo nodded. "It does. But we've been unable to locate a skilled Artifact Refiner, and I fear attempting repairs myself might result in failure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Li Xiangshang produced a jade pendant from his robes and offered it to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Surprised, Ning Zhuo waved his hand. "I've already stated, Senior Li, this Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat serves as compensation for your use of innate talent to aid in the army's establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Yet even after the Qing-Jiao Army's formation, you still permit me to cultivate with this vessel," Li Xiangshang countered. "Truthfully, this has been of immense benefit to me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Once a mere mortal fish, my cultivation talent was limited, my physical foundation inadequate. This hindered my practice of the Ascending Dragon Transformation. But this recent cultivation session has rectified those deficiencies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Thus, you have shown great kindness to me, and I must express my gratitude!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily and declined once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Unexpectedly, Li Xiangshang spoke with grave seriousness: "Little Friend Jiao Ma, this jade pendant holds extraordinary significance. You must cherish it carefully."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He continued, "My journey here was ordered by the Dragon Lord. However, before my departure, the Turtle Prime Minister detained me to create a good karmic connection. He specifically performed a divination for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"He revealed that this visit to White Paper Immortal City would be a cultivation opportunity. If handled properly, I could encounter a benefactor who would address my cultivation's shortcomings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Furthermore, he warned that maintaining this Noble Luck requires sacrifice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"He advised me to gift my most precious treasure to this benefactor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"After much consideration, I concluded that the most valuable item I possess is this Dragon Qi jade pendant bestowed by my lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"I sincerely hope you will accept it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Having reached this point, Li Xiangshang - a Golden Core cultivator of noble status - bowed deeply to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Ning Zhuo had grown increasingly intrigued by the mysteries of fate. Hearing of the Turtle Prime Minister's divination, his interest was piqued, and he grew more serious. "What is the purpose of this jade pendant?" he asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Li Xiangshang spoke candidly: "This jade pendant contains a strand of Dragon Qi from my lord. It's meant to surround me with its influence, providing a tangible reference for my cultivation of the Ascending Dragon Transformation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"As for any other purposes, that's beyond my knowledge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Upon hearing this, Ning Zhuo hastily declined: "This is your treasured artifact for achieving the Dao. How could I possibly take what rightfully belongs to you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">But Li Xiangshang's resolve remained unshaken as he pressed the gift: "The Turtle Prime Minister is a wise and benevolent being. I'm certain he wouldn't lead me astray. To preserve one's Noble Luck, the offering must align with the recipient's needs. Otherwise, how could it sustain such fortune?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"This jade pendant, Jiao Ma, you truly require it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo found himself caught in hesitation. At that moment, his Mechanism Ring subtly constricted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">A chill ran down his spine. When he tried to refuse, the ring tightened further. Yet when he considered accepting, it relaxed its grip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Understanding dawned on him: "Heaven's grand designs and calculations guide me! This is truly wondrous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">With a slight nod, he finally accepted the Dragon Qi jade pendant and stored it in his robes.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
