<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"I have no more questions," Ning Zhuo said after reviewing the decree scroll, handing it over to Zhou Zeshen.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen examined it carefully for a long time before nodding slowly and passing the scroll to the others.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu took turns reading it and nodded in agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Subsequently, everyone took turns signing the decree contract.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji put away the decree and then proceeded to arrange for the reformation team members from all four directions to sign it.<br/>
<br/>
This process was personally overseen by him.<br/>
<br/>
With his Heaven-Piercing Eyes and divine constable methods, he could minimize the possibility of cheating.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji then instructed, "You four will be the leaders of the reformation team. Next, please actively strive for various positions within the Lava Immortal Palace. If possible, aim for the Five Elements Tower. The true culprit behind the bombardment of Fire Persimmon Mountain's peak, which triggered the beast tide, is still at large. If any of you can find relevant clues, I will reward you handsomely!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo accepted the task with determination, immediately expressing that he would do his utmost to work towards this goal, protecting the homeland while ensuring that evil no longer spreads!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then mentioned, "In my clan, there is a genius cultivator named Ning Xiaohui, who arrived here early and entered the Immortal Palace to earn contributions. She must have valuable insights into securing various positions. Why not have her share her experience with us?" Zhu Xuanji shook his head, "Currently, she is on an important mission, so do not disturb her. Moreover, I believe that although she has some success, her experience may not be very helpful for our upcoming actions. Everything will depend on your own efforts."<br/>
<br/>
After Zhu Xuanji finished his instructions, he dismissed everyone.<br/>
<br/>
After leaving the side hall, Ning Zhuo and the others walked back together.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen initiated a conversation with him, "We are all trial disciples, and we have access to far more tasks than outsiders. But precisely because there are so many projects, we also face the dilemma of choosing."<br/>
<br/>
"I believe there must be an optimal choice that allows us to achieve the most merit with the least time, effort, and cost." Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement with Zhou Zeshen's view, saying, "I couldn't persuade Lord Zhu to let Ning Xiaohui share her successful experience with us, which is disadvantageous for us. We have just arrived here and lack a lot of information and understanding."<br/>
<br/>
"So I think our first step should be to cast a wide net, taking on different tasks comprehensively and conducting extensive reconnaissance. After gathering the results of our reconnaissance, we can then calculate and determine the optimal task selection plan. Finally, we will promote this plan. What do you think, Brother Zhou?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen laughed heartily, patting Ning Zhuo on the shoulder, "It's easy to communicate with smart people!" Ning Zhuo's plan coincided with his own thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that Ning Zhuo and Zhou Zeshen had already agreed, Zhou Zhu, who always followed Zhou Zeshen's lead, naturally had no objections.<br/>
<br/>
Now it was up to Zheng Jian.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Jian, having listened to their discussion, had already decided to collaborate.<br/>
<br/>
Before coming, the Zheng family patriarch had privately advised him to maintain good relations with the Zhou and Ning families.<br/>
<br/>
Times have changed.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the accidental beheading of a Golden Core true disciple from the Great Purity Palace by the Zheng family's mechanical scythe, the entire family faced a huge predicament.<br/>
<br/>
In such a situation, the Zheng family desperately needed the help of external allies.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Zheng Jian genuinely believed that the plan conceived by Zhou Zeshen and Ning Zhuo was indeed the best.<br/>
<br/>
So he agreed without any hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
However, Zheng Jian also mentioned Meng Chong, "Now that the four sides are cooperating, shouldn't we also bring Meng Chong in?" This suggestion made Zhou Zeshen and Ning Zhuo exchange a glance.<br/>
<br/>
This time, Ning Zhuo remained silent.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zeshen said, "In the early stages, we might not be suitable to interact with the reformation team from the City Lord's Mansion."<br/>
<br/>
"Didn't you notice? Lord Zhu Xuanji only summoned our three families this time, even though the contract required the participation of all four parties. Why didn't he call Meng Chong in as well? From this, we can see Lord Zhu Xuanji's intentions or inclinations." Zheng Jian suddenly realized, quickly cupping his hands to thank Zhou Zeshen.<br/>
<br/>
The group reached a crossroads and bid each other farewell.<br/>
<br/>
The residences of the Ning, Zhou, and Zheng families were not far apart.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo watched the backs of Zheng Jian and the others as they left, lost in thought.<br/>
<br/>
He pondered the current situation: "The three families originally followed Zhu Xuanji, but after the Golden Core conflict, the Zheng family fell into a predicament, leading to the Ning and Zhou families' cautious observation of Zhu Xuanji. The situation has subtly changed, and the three families are now more closely connected than before."<br/>
<br/>
"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit," Ning Zhuo called softly in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
In the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been secretly observing Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing him call its name, it couldn't help but grit its teeth.<br/>
<br/>
The more it understood Ning Zhuo, the more it knew the whole picture and the truth, the more deeply it feared Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
It really didn't want to deal with such a cunning, deeply scheming, and highly disguised little monster like Ning Zhuo, but considering the growing threat of Ning Xiaohui...<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gritted its teeth and pretended to be weak, responding to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Young Master, you have finally entered the true Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned slightly, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, your condition seems to have worsened?" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit replied accordingly, "Yes, Young Master."<br/>
<br/>
"The Lava Immortal Palace and I are one. It is essentially my body. Now, I am constantly under attack from the beast tide. Every time the Lava Immortal Palace is damaged, I am correspondingly weakened. Our connection may be interrupted at any time."<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps from observing Ning Zhuo for so long, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had also become more cunning.<br/>
<br/>
In this conversation, it laid the groundwork for future disconnection.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit mentioned the threat of Ning Xiaohui, urging Ning Zhuo to take action against her.<br/>
<br/>
"I understand," Ning Zhuo said, frowning slightly, showing some difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
"You must know that dealing with Ning Xiaohui is not that easy. I need to find an opportunity, an appropriate moment to strike. But for now, such opportunities are quite rare." Ning Zhuo explained to the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
This was because, like Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji and other Golden Core cultivators would also be stationed in the Lava Immortal Palace, actively resisting the beast tide outside the palace.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo wanted to make a move against Ning Xiaohui now, it would undoubtedly be like jumping under the eyes of the Golden Core cultivators, which was too risky!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had directly tested Zhu Xuanji in the side hall earlier.<br/>
<br/>
He pretended to request Ning Xiaohui to come and share her successful experience, actually probing how much Zhu Xuanji valued Ning Xiaohui.<br/>
<br/>
The result of the test was that Zhu Xuanji did not allow anyone to contact Ning Xiaohui! More precisely, he did not allow anyone to access the Historical Records Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
He even isolated Ning Xiaohui from others, not allowing any daily communication or contact.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo knew very well that Zhu Xuanji valued the Historical Records Pavilion and Ning Xiaohui so much.<br/>
<br/>
In such a situation, if he rashly took action against Ning Xiaohui, it would likely trigger a full investigation by Zhu Xuanji!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Ning Zhuo also had his own plans.<br/>
<br/>
He hoped to secure a position in the Historical Records Pavilion and simultaneously eliminate Ning Xiaohui!<br/>
<br/>
In doing so, he could obtain the precious information recorded in the Historical Records Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, by relying on this position, Ning Zhuo could easily mislead Zhu Xuanji and indirectly make use of Zhu Xuanji's formidable Golden Core combat power.<br/>
<br/>
If he could achieve this level, it would be most beneficial for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Having already made his calculations, Ning Zhuo said to the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, "Let's not talk about this anymore."<br/>
<br/>
"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, design the best plan for me. Let me choose the most suitable tasks from these numerous ones. With this plan, I can gain more merit faster and with less effort!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit spun around on its throne, wanting to refuse Ning Zhuo's request.<br/>
<br/>
But it couldn't help it; the threat of Ning Xiaohui was always like a sharp sword hanging over its head.<br/>
<br/>
From its standpoint, it had no ability to deal with Ning Xiaohui and could only rely on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the requests made by Ning Zhuo had to be fulfilled as much as possible!<br/>
<br/>
Soon, Ning Zhuo received a stream of information.<br/>
<br/>
He carefully reviewed it.<br/>
<br/>
The information listed the main tasks he needed to accomplish and detailed the intelligence related to those tasks.<br/>
<br/>
These pieces of intelligence were something Ning Zhuo couldn't access with his own merit token alone.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of this merit token, it was something every cultivator entering the Immortal Palace was granted when they were guided by the treasure light.<br/>
<br/>
Even if lost outside the Immortal Palace, the next time they entered, the cultivator would receive a replacement.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this replacement wasn't free and would deduct some of the cultivator's accumulated merit in the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
After reviewing it once, Ning Zhuo realized that although the plan was quite excellent and meticulously designed, it lacked broad applicability.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the tasks he needed to accomplish stemmed from the three positions he currently held.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had passed through three trials, so he now held the positions of Medical Pavilion Master, Tower Master of the Cannon Tower, and Commander of the Command Platform.<br/>
<br/>
These three positions were all of the second rank, and the rewards corresponding to second-rank tasks were enormous.<br/>
<br/>
Others, including all the reformation team members, couldn't see these tasks on their own merit tokens.<br/>
<br/>
After a second review, Ning Zhuo discovered the underlying pattern.<br/>
<br/>
His task arrangement was roughly divided into three stages.<br/>
<br/>
The first stage mainly came from the position of Medical Pavilion Master.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo needed to repair some mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
These mechanical constructs were not just mechanical puppets but also included some mechanical buildings.<br/>
<br/>
The second stage of tasks came from the position of Command Platform Commander.<br/>
<br/>
After obtaining this position, Ning Zhuo could arrange formations to a certain extent, commanding many mechanical puppets to be deployed on the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The third stage finally involved the position of Tower Master of the Cannon Tower.<br/>
<br/>
After reviewing this information, Ning Zhuo was puzzled and asked the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, "I see that the tasks related to the Tower Master of the Cannon Tower all have minimum standards. If these minimum standards are not met, my merit will be deducted. Why is that?" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit hesitated, not wanting to reveal the answer to Ning Zhuo, pondering whether it should make its escape now.</div>
