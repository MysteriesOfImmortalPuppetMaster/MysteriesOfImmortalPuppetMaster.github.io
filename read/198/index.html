<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"It's too old, its days are numbered. It slumbers through its days, barely clinging to life. This time, we have awakened it." "Quickly, seek aid from the City Lord!"<br/>
<br/>
As everyone transmitted their messages and communicated at full speed, the Nascent Soul Demon Ape fully opened its eyes.<br/>
<br/>
It did not attack but changed its sleeping posture, revealing its drooping chest and swollen abdomen.<br/>
<br/>
It made a series of "qi qi qi qi" sounds, scanning the human Golden Core cultivators with a scrutinizing gaze.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and the others were stunned.<br/>
<br/>
They were quite familiar with the Fire Fusion Demon Ape, as the three Golden Core families lived in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and had many encounters with the Fire Fusion Demon Ape.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, being a Divine Constable and a member of the royal family, had also conducted thorough investigations and read numerous royal intelligence reports before arriving at Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
So, when they saw the Nascent Soul-level Demon Ape's behavior, they communicated through voice transmission and exclaimed, "This female ape is in heat!" Among the Fire Fusion Demon Apes, female apes were extremely rare, with the number of male apes being at least eighty times that of female apes.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, in every ape group, female apes were the most precious assets, the guarantee of the group's future.<br/>
<br/>
This particular Fire Fusion Ape group was quite special, having a female ape that had grown to the Nascent Soul level, making her status even more noble than the previous Golden Core Demon Ape King.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder her dwelling was so tightly guarded by the other apes.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji hurriedly transmitted, "Do not act rashly! The female ape being in heat is actually our opportunity."<br/>
<br/>
"It seems to have mistaken us for potential mates chosen by the ape group." Zheng Shuangjun, holding his twin hooks, changed his expression, "Lord Zhu, what do you mean by this?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji said, "As long as one of us is chosen by it and mates with it, our relationship with the ape group will change drastically, from enemies to friends." "At that time, not only will the ape group not attack us, but they will also actively offer us many treasures." "You all live in Fire Persimmon Mountain, don't you know this habit?"<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, it was like this.<br/>
<br/>
Female apes were insatiable, and male apes of the same level often died during mating.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when a female ape's life level was too high and she was in heat, the male apes would not dare to approach her and would capture male apes from other groups or human men to satisfy the powerful female ape's needs.<br/>
<br/>
If a male ape or man survived after satisfying the female ape, they would be treated well by the ape group.<br/>
<br/>
Offering treasures was the most common way to express gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Zhu Xuanji's words, Zheng Shuangjun and the others felt a chill in their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying's expression was grim, "Lord Zhu, do you know what you are saying?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji spread his hands, "The situation is as it is. If you want to wait for Meng Kui's support, I might still have a chance, but you all don't." "We are in a deadly situation, and only by abandoning everything can we seek life from death!"<br/>
<br/>
"The good news is: the female ape only chooses one target each time she mates. Only if this target dies midway and the female ape still has strong needs will she choose a second one."<br/>
<br/>
"In other words, it will only choose one of us." "At that time, no matter who it is, even if it's me, I will have to bite the bullet." "For survival, this is not shameful at all!" "Do you want to live or die?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's words made the Golden Core cultivators' expressions vary.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian sighed, "Of course, we want to live."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan, feeling that his chances of being chosen were the lowest, had a calm expression and a firm tone, "I agree with Lord Zhu's plan!"<br/>
<br/>
The others remained silent.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji clapped his hands, "That's settled then!"<br/>
<br/>
"No matter who is chosen, the rest of us must keep this matter a secret."<br/>
<br/>
The other Golden Core cultivators strongly agreed.<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul-level female ape exposed her chest, continuously making "qi qi" sounds.<br/>
<br/>
Her gaze swept back and forth, making the Golden Core cultivators pale and their hearts race.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the female ape's gaze paused, and she pointed her finger at‚ÄîNing Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
The female ape beckoned him with her finger.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was dumbfounded, his face full of disbelief.<br/>
<br/>
"Me?"<br/>
<br/>
"Why me?!" He couldn't understand it at all.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to him, Zheng Shuangjun and Zheng Danlian were much more robust, fitting the Fire Fusion Demon Ape's aesthetic.<br/>
<br/>
Although the Zhou family Golden Core was a bit thin, at least his cultivation technique wasn't ice-based.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan primarily cultivated the Ice Heart Technique, and this cold aura naturally clashed with the Fire Fusion Demon Ape, which should naturally dislike it.<br/>
<br/>
"Why?" "Why?!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan shook his head, constantly muttering.<br/>
<br/>
"There is no reason. Since it has chosen you, please bear with it." Zheng Shuangjun relaxed, taking out the Nine Yang Yellow Ox Balm.<br/>
<br/>
"Quickly, take some orally and apply some to the key areas!" Zheng Shuangjun urged.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was still in disbelief and unwilling to accept it, but a bottle of balm was shoved into his hands.<br/>
<br/>
Then, Zhu Xuanji and the others began to undress, giving Ning Jiufan strong support.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family Golden Core took out a pill, "This is the Spring Vitality Pill. After taking it, it can greatly enhance your energy and stamina."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian rummaged through his storage bag and took out a ring-shaped magical artifact, "Shameful, I once killed an evil cultivator from the Flower Plucking Sect and obtained this Dragon Yang Essence Ring. I could never get rid of it, but it can be used now."<br/>
<br/>
Reminded, Zhu Xuanji also took out a sachet, "I once captured a female demon and obtained this Spring Dream Sachet. I intended to use it as a clue for further investigation, but you can use it now."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was clearly resistant, but the other Golden Core cultivators were adamant, stuffing pills, magical artifacts, and other items into his hands.<br/>
<br/>
"Go!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ning brother, we will remember your contribution and won't let you sacrifice in vain." "When we return to the city, I'll treat you to a meal!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan shook his head repeatedly, "I don't want the meal, I don't want these things. I think we can still discuss this further." But the next moment, he was forcibly pulled out of the crowd by an invisible force.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that the Nascent Soul female ape had lost patience and acted directly!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan glared angrily.<br/>
<br/>
He was caressed on the face by the female ape.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan glared angrily.<br/>
<br/>
He was stripped of his clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan glared angrily.<br/>
<br/>
He suddenly realized, looked up to the sky, and sighed, his eyes filled with blood, squeezing out words from between his teeth, "Forced by circumstances, what can I do! I can only submit, I can only submit!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ning brother, you are noble!" Zhu Xuanji was moved.<br/>
<br/>
The other Golden Core cultivators showed sorrowful expressions, all echoing with praise.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan suddenly said, "No, I must reach an agreement with you all." "Especially you, Lord Zhu, I am doing this entirely because of you." "From now on, my Ning family must be in Fire Persimmon Immortal City..."<br/>
<br/>
He quickly transmitted his conditions.<br/>
<br/>
While being forced to submit, Ning Jiufan also forced the other two Golden Core families and Zhu Xuanji to agree.<br/>
<br/>
In a short time, he forced the other Golden Core cultivators to sign an alliance agreement with him.<br/>
<br/>
The agreement guaranteed the Ning family's position and future interests in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and Ning Jiufan also obtained many resources suitable for his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
The Nascent Soul female ape, excited, pounced on Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan closed his eyes in pain, waving his hands to use a magical artifact, releasing an ice mist that tightly covered himself and the female ape.<br/>
<br/>
This disappointed the Zheng family Golden Core cultivators who wanted to watch the show.<br/>
<br/>
The two Zhou family Golden Core cultivators quietly retracted the jade slips in their sleeves, feeling extremely regretful that they couldn't record the scene.<br/>
<br/>
This was an unusual, prolonged battle!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan was drenched in sweat, struggling to cope, his face pale, and quickly weakening.<br/>
<br/>
The female ape let out a satisfied roar.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Ning, hang in there!" The human Golden Core cultivators sincerely cheered for Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
"Why did the female ape choose Brother Ning in the end?" Zhou Nongying expressed her confusion.<br/>
<br/>
The others shared the same doubt.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Danlian speculated, "Perhaps this female ape has lived long enough and wants to try something new?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's heart moved, suddenly thinking of the answer, "It should be the External Peach Fate Core, right?"<br/>
<br/>
"Back then, Meng Kui used his divine ability to stir the fate field covering the entire Fire Persimmon Mountain."<br/>
<br/>
"The only method he could use was the External Peach Fate Core."<br/>
<br/>
"The reason he could use this item without causing a fate ripple and affecting himself was because this peach core carried strong peach blossom luck."<br/>
<br/>
"Strictly speaking, the External Peach Fate Core is a magical artifact that increases one's peach blossom luck. Its attack power, which can harm others, is actually just the cost of increasing peach blossom luck."<br/>
<br/>
Everyone suddenly understood, "So that's how it is."<br/>
<br/>
"No wonder the female ape didn't choose anyone else but Brother Ning."<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Ning too. He sneaked into the Immortal Palace with us, got hit by the External Peach Fate Core, and ended up like this. Isn't this just karma in the Buddhist way?"<br/>
<br/>
With this explanation, everyone's sympathy for Ning Jiufan's tragic experience greatly diminished.<br/>
<br/>
In the underground base.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo wiped his face with his sleeve, removing the sweat.<br/>
<br/>
"Success!" He looked at the mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Ning Zhuo's frantic assembly, the mechanical ape was now fully equipped.<br/>
<br/>
Its head contained the Wild Thought Disrupting Drum, and its chest housed the Mechanical Heart Furnace - Fire Essence.<br/>
<br/>
The lower half, originally just a skeleton, was now fitted with mechanical components, fully disguised.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo extracted Yuan Dasheng's spirit and placed it into the mechanical ape.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical ape activated, opened its eyes, moved its limbs, and then knelt on one knee, saluting Ning Zhuo, "This subordinate greets the master."<br/>
<br/>
"Take this to conceal all your aura!" Ning Zhuo extended his tongue.<br/>
<br/>
From the base of his tongue, a mark quickly emerged.<br/>
<br/>
The mark soon turned into a cloud of mist, floating out.<br/>
<br/>
The mist transformed into a pure white flower bud, entirely composed of cloud smoke, with wisps of smoke gently drifting from its edges.<br/>
<br/>
Cloud Concealment Bud!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo guided the bud into the depths of the mechanical ape's body.<br/>
<br/>
The flower bud, made of cloud smoke, reverted to its previous mark form, imprinting itself on the surface of the mechanical ape's heart furnace.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical ape's surging aura was completely concealed.<br/>
<br/>
"Yuan Dasheng, I command you to break through the ghost fog and rescue Brother Sun!"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, this subordinate obeys."<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical ape reached its destination.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si did not notice.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Han suddenly said, "Who's there?!"<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, the mechanical ape charged through the ghost fog.<br/>
<br/>
After all, it possessed Golden Core-level combat power, and the ghost fog, which stirred emotions, was countered by the mechanical construct.<br/>
<br/>
The ghost fog was partially dispersed, but Sun Lingtong was still trapped.<br/>
<br/>
He was tightly embraced by Yang Chanyu, who had already activated the evil technique of Yin-Yang Absorption!<br/>
<br/>
"Elder!" Ning Zhuo's voice transmitted directly to Sun Lingtong's heart through the Life-Hanging Thread.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was overjoyed, "Little brother, you finally came!" "Quick, lend me some Yang energy to cope." "Otherwise, I'm about to lose control!" Ning Zhuo: "Huh?!"</div>
