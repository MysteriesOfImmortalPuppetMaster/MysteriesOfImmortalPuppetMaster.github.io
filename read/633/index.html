<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">At that moment, the thick earth trembled violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The City-Protecting Formation of White Paper Immortal City was activated in full, channeling the waters of the Underworld Flood Dragon River from the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Tens of millions of tons of Underworld Flood Dragon River water, mixed with immeasurable amounts of Yin Qi and combined with the Ink River water within White Paper Immortal City, formed a continuously rotating "mountain" of black water!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This Blackwater Mountain lifted the entire White Paper Immortal City, like a giant whale raising its head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">After a dozen breaths of time, the once-flat Immortal City had transformed into a mountain fortress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Blackwater Mountain White Paper Immortal City!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The heavens darkened, and swirling, ominous clouds filled the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The previously open South City Gate had already slammed shut, trapping the enemy forces in a "shut the gate and beat the dog" formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Luo Si's command tent erupted in commotion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Xie Sichao's expression changed dramatically, and he gasped in panic, "Such a sudden development!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Many Ghost Generals felt a chill run down their spines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">They even suspected that the South City Gate's earlier easy breach by Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had been a trap set by White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Now, the numerous Golden Core-level Ghost Generals and the Three-Headed Dead Bone Giant Spirit had been lured in like fish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">With the city gates closed, the only remaining escape route was the Path of Returning to Silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Should we order a retreat or continue to reinforce our forces?" All eyes turned to Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">At this critical moment, they suddenly realized that Luo Si's previous caution had been correct, and the Vanguard General's proactive attack had been a reckless gamble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Under the expectant gazes of the crowd, Luo Si remained motionless, offering no indication of his intentions. He simply observed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Within the Paper Giant, Ning Zhuo's eyes shone with keen intelligence. A surge of realization washed over him as he discerned that the earlier events had been a carefully orchestrated trap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"This aligns perfectly with the City Lord's modus operandi," he thought. "She has used everyone, including me, as mere pawns in her grand scheme!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">For her larger strategy, any piece could be sacrificed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Mother, now's our chance to eliminate Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer! Without her Curved Path Retreat, we can devour the enemy's crucial military might in one fell swoop!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed excitedly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin, however, kept her eyes tightly shut, communicating solely through her divine sense: "Little Zhuo, restrain your impatience. This is not the time for us to act. Trust me, the City Lord will make her move. The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord has inevitably targeted the White Paper Immortal City for blood sacrifice. This binds his fate to the City Lord's, ensuring a violent clash."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">After a pause, she continued, her voice strained: "We... must wait patiently... Wait for our opportunity... Only by disrupting the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme can we truly end this calamity and grant the city's people a life of... true peace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo jolted upright. "Mother?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He sensed that Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin's divine sense was flickering intermittently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">This scene was all too familiar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Once, Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin had experienced the same condition, rapidly deteriorating until she lost consciousness and became unresponsive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">But this time, the process was accelerating far too quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">In such a short span, she already showed signs of collapsing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The City Lord's Main Body sat quietly, awaiting Luo Si's next military command.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">No retreat. No reinforcements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Her expression darkened, and she sneered inwardly. "This enemy general is rather interesting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Since the Vanguard General and his forces had recklessly charged through the South City Gate, withdrawal was now pointless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Mercy has no place in warfare!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Luo Si's inaction was itself an order: continue serving as bait to lure White Paper Immortal City into further action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Luo Si needed to gauge their true strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Very well, see for yourselves," the City Lord's Main Body thought, unable to draw out any more enemy forces. She tossed a ruler into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The ruler transformed into a streak of light, piercing the sky and appearing above the battlefield at the South City Gate within moments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The scale hung suspended in mid-air, drawing the attention of many.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">It measured exactly three feet and six and a half inches, its surface smooth and uniformly dark green. The body of the scale was straight and rigid, its sides densely covered with intricate patterns resembling ice-cracked porcelain glazeâ€”seemingly chaotic yet possessing an underlying beauty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">A faint, gray-white aura of Great Primordial Qi emanated from the scale's surface, enveloping it like a gauzy veil over jade. As the threads of qi flowed and swirled, they emitted the softest rustling sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Great Primordial Dispersal Scale!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">In the next instant, Great Primordial Qi surged forth, merging with the jade radiance of the scale, and shot toward Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Rock Demon Ghost General stepped forward, shielding Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer with his body. Overcome with a profound sense of foreboding, he immediately erected his strongest defensive barrier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">But as the Great Primordial Jade Light struck him, he instantly disintegrated into a wisp of Yin Qi, a Golden Core, three souls, and six corporeal spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The magic treasures and weapons he had equipped clattered to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Great Primordial, essence before form; Dispersal, the end of calamity, returning to the void!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Just as the verse inscribed on the back of the jade scale proclaimed:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Jade measures the span of calamity; The Great Primordial returns to dust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The Rock Demon Ghost General, powerless to resist, shattered into fragments and perished on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This spectacle sent chills down everyone's spines, and they instinctively recoiled, desperate to put distance between themselves and that terrifying jade scale!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Amidst the chaos, the Vanguard General roared, "Protect Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The generals of the Underworld Army quickly realized that with the South City Gate closed, the Curved Path was their only means of swift retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Stiffening their resolve, they surged forward en masse, forming a protective barrier around Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Quick!" they shouted. "Adjust the direction of the Curved Path so we can escape!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">It was then revealed that the Path of Returning to Silence was a one-way passage, functioning either from outside the city to inside, or vice versa.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer stood motionless, her face blank, showing no reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">As they spoke, the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale emitted its mystical light once more, illuminating the surrounding area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Ghost Generals paled in terror. Despite their desperate defenses, every ghost within the light's range was disintegrated, their forms dispersing. Countless magic treasures and weapons shattered into fragments, their components scattering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was also affected, her soul and spirit scattering, leaving behind only a Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Even the Return to Silence Path Candle, burned down to a stub, was reduced to a pool of wax, a severed wick, and a flickering flame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This astonishing spectacle froze the entire battlefield in silence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Beyond the mystical light, several Ghost Generals remained, their souls still trembling with fear. They knew they had been lucky to cling to their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Without the support of wax or wick, the flame of the Return to Silence Path Candle rapidly shrank, causing the Path of Returning to Silence to contract sharply, on the verge of vanishing completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Within the Paper Giant, Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin opened her eyes and sighed softly. "The time has come, Little Zhuo," she said to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo hesitated for a moment, then abruptly unleashed the Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Familiar flames ignited once more, this time spreading rapidly outward from within the Paper Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Meanwhile, Meng Yaoyin made a subtle gesture, causing ripples to spread through the surrounding space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">In the next instant, she summoned the magic treasure, the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The lantern was an eight-sided prism, four feet and two inches tall, with a diameter of one foot and eight inches. Its top tapered to a domed shape, while the base was flat and square. It appeared to be made of brass and sandalwood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The Interwoven Field Paths Lantern could significantly regulate Earth Qi in an area, transforming it into fertile, productive land, and could even create intricate networks of paths and fields.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">During her lifetime, Meng Yaoyin had secretly installed this lantern within the Paper Giant, harnessing its power to secretly connect several hidden territories in the Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Within each of these hidden territories lay an army of paper soldiers!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's Golden Core glowed brightly, erupting with a torrent of spiritual energy that poured into the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern, unleashing its full power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">This, in turn, activated related Formations, linking Yin and Yang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The flames ignited by the Cremation Prajna Spirit Release Sutra now blazed fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Paper Giant suddenly burst into flames, startling both sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Under the cover of the firelight, the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern's power directly influenced the battlefield, causing the Path of Returning to Silence to abruptly expand!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">What was once a narrow path now transformed into a swirling black vortex, revealing a broad avenue that directly connected to the Underworld instead of the outskirts of the Living Realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The flaming Paper Giant, under the astonished gazes of all present, strode purposefully into the vortex. Its figure vanished into the Underworld, swiftly disappearing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Before leaving, it casually swept up several Golden Cores, along with a disassembled pile of magic treasures and weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Little Ma!" Qing Chi shouted, leading the charge without hesitation into the Underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The Qing-Jiao Army followed closely behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Everything's going according to plan," Sun Lingtong observed as the Qing-Jiao Army charged into the passage. He then led the ox cavalry as the third wave to enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Among the Underworld Army, the remaining Ghost Generals reacted swiftly, rushing into the passage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Luo Si frowned deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">This passage leading directly to the Underworld reeked of conspiracy. He issued a decisive order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Receiving the new command, countless Headless Ghost Riders within the White Paper Immortal City immediately changed direction and charged into the passage, becoming the fifth wave to enter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Within the City Lord's Mansion, the City Lord's Main Body observed the entire scene unfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Her brow furrowed as she pondered the situation, then remotely commanded the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale to strike at the black hole channel once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Great Primordial Dispersal Scale's power was overwhelming. Just as it was about to disperse the channel, the Bone Tomb Daoist let out a shrill cry and, moving like lightning, desperately squeezed into the passage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He had no other choice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The situation had changed too quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The City Lord's Main Body's intervention yielded tremendous results. She was extraordinary in her own right, and as the City Lord, she was amplified by the full power of the Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">White Paper Immortal City was unlike Fire Persimmon Immortal City. The former, crafted by the Profound Primordial Scholar, served mysterious purposes, seemingly tailored specifically for the City Lord. The latter, built collaboratively by the Southern Bean Royal Family and local aristocratic clans, strictly constrained the City Lord, making it difficult for her to personally enhance herself using the City-Protecting Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">This marked the first public debut of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Its profound and eerie capabilities left onlookers in awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">As the City Lord's Main Body officially entered the fray, the defensive battle for White Paper Immortal City took a decisive turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Blackwater Mountain now supported White Paper Immortal City, transforming the battlefield into an easily defendable position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The Underworld Army suffered catastrophic losses: numerous Golden Core-level Ghost Generals, three Three-Headed Dead Bone Giant Spirits, vast numbers of Headless Ghost Cavalry, and the treacherous Bone Tomb Daoist himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Although the White Paper Immortal City had successfully executed its "close the gate and fight the dog" strategy, it had lost crucial combat forces, including the Paper Giant, Ning Zhuo (Jiao Ma), and the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Both sides suffered casualties, but the Underworld Army sustained greater losses overall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">In the Underworld, at the Offering of Tribulation Altar, a yin wind swept across, billowing the robes of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. Despite his best efforts to recover, his healing progress was disappointingly slow. After the battles against the Lady of Sorrowful Bones and the Soundless Ghost Monk, his combat strength had dwindled to just sixty percent of his original capacity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Yet, a formidable enemy had arrived!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Amidst the dark, silent mists, candlelight flickered to life. Illuminated by the flames, a charred lotus platform drifted steadily toward them. Upon the platform sat a Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">His body was entirely composed of blackened bones, draped in a tattered, billowing cloak that whipped in the wind. He possessed no flesh, skin, or organsâ€”only a skeletal frame. Yet his eye sockets blazed with candlelight. A bronze chain coiled around his left arm, while his right arm was swathed in a layer of oily yellow cloth, from which wax dripped continuously. With each breath, sparks erupted from his mouth and nostrils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Around his body, nestled within the lotus seeds of the lotus platform, stood nine uniquely shaped candles. These unlit candles each possessed a peculiar and mystical form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord took a deep breath, his expression carrying an unprecedented solemnity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He sighed deeply. "So, you've come after all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">This formidable adversary was no ordinary enemy; he was Lord Yin Jiuzhu of the Ghostfire Prefecture, the strongest and most feared entity in the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Ghostfire Prefecture and the Forgetful River Prefecture had been neighbors for eons, their relationship tense and unimprovable. Regardless of who held the upper hand, both harbored schemes to swallow the other whole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's bold move would inevitably provoke a violent reaction from Lord Yin Jiuzhu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">In the Underworld, none would be more eager to see the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord fail than Lord Yin Jiuzhu himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"You've ventured far from the Ghostfire Prefecture, deep into the heart of my Forgetful River Prefecture, abandoning your geographical advantage to launch this reckless assault," the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord said. "It seems you've truly lost sight of reason."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He shook his head, his expression filled with pity for his opponent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Lord Yin Jiuzhu scoffed. "Stop the pretense. Lady of Sorrowful Bones and the Soundless Ghost Monk were both my pawns."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"Besides them, there's also the Jade-Faced Rakshasa."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Heh heh heh, why don't you guess where she is now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">A sense of foreboding welled up in the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, but he quickly suppressed the thought. "She must be here, doing everything in her power to prevent my attainment of the Dao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"If she's truly not here, that would be a great pity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"After your defeat, you'll bitterly regret not focusing all your efforts on targeting me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Lord Guihuo sneered. "Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, do you think I haven't had someone perform divination? The Jade-Faced Rakshasa has already infiltrated your Forgetful River Immortal City. She will wreak havoc within the city, for I've had it divined that destroying the Forgetful River Immortal City will greatly hinder your attainment of the Dao!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Before he finished speaking, Lord Guihuo made his move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">A candle directly in front of him lit itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The candle was as pale as a withered bone, its surface covered in tiny holes that resembled countless wailing mouths. Its wick was a tangled strand of translucent, grayish-white smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Once lit, the flame burned faintly, revealing countless struggling soul shadows that emitted heart-pounding, mournful whispers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Soul-Summoning Candle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The candle flame erupted with terrifying suction, violently drawing in the souls of the surrounding Underworld Cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord also felt his soul destabilize and hastily cast a spell to steady himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Lord Guihuo tested a move and, having achieved the desired result, threw his head back and laughed heartily. "Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, you've truly grown weak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Secret Realm</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"Where are we?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"How are there so many paper figures?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The Qing-Jiao Army soldiers were filled with apprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Little Ma!" Qing Chi shouted, rushing toward the Paper Giant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The Paper Giant collapsed with a thunderous crash, its spiritual energy, gathered from the flames, converging entirely into Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's body.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
