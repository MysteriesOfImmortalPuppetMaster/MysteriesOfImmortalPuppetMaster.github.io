<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Three Generals’ Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Liu Er was revising military affairs, his brows furrowed in worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He finished handling the last piece of military business, placed it on the corner of the table, and could not help letting out a long sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">After calling in a subordinate to convey these orders, Liu Er lifted the door curtain, looked toward the camp’s main gate, then lowered the curtain again. With his hands behind his back, he paced inside the tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He continued this until a subordinate came to report that Ning Zhuo had returned, whereupon Liu Er finally revealed a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Why has he not returned yet?” Liu Er murmured to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Before departing to attend Shuang Jing’s banquet this time, Ning Zhuo had already informed Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Because of this, from early morning onward, Liu Er had been on edge, unable to focus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He immediately lifted the door curtain and ran toward the camp gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">When he encountered Ning Zhuo, he burst into hearty laughter, his smile as passionate as fire: “Strategist, you are back! It’s good that you’re back!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">While welcoming him, Liu Er secretly observed Ning Zhuo’s expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Seeing Ning Zhuo’s furrowed brow and evident worry, Liu Er’s heart sank. He hurriedly asked, “Strategist, did Shuang Jing make things difficult for you? Rest assured, we three brothers will support you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Liu Er’s smile froze. His heart instantly turned cold. The thing he feared most had indeed happened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Zhuo shook his head: “That’s not it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“It’s that Shuang Jing invited me, wishing to recruit me as his retainer.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">He still forced a smile: “This matter needs careful consideration.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“Though Shuang Jing’s birth is noble, Strategist, your own background is actually not too different.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“And if you become a retainer, you lose your freedom…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Oh, that won’t happen. He spoke plainly: I may leave at any time, and he will not restrict my freedom.” Ning Zhuo waved his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Liu Er’s smile froze once again, his heart sinking to the bottom. He still cupped his hands to congratulate him: “This… in that case, it’s indeed very good. After all, Shuang Jing’s lineage is truly extraordinary. I must congratulate the Strategist. Depending on Shuang Jing, you will be even more capable of avenging your family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo shook his head: “I did not promise him on the spot.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Liu Er’s eyes suddenly lit up: “Could it be, Strategist, you…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo nodded: “I am still considering it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Liu Er’s expression dimmed again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo glanced at the training ground inside the camp: “Why do I not see Generals Guan Hong and Zhang Hei drilling the troops?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Our army was only recently founded. After this victory, we captured a Nascent Soul cultivator alive, and morale is strong. We should seize every moment to keep drilling and prepare thoroughly for the great battle on the future battlefield.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Liu Er heaved a deep sigh: “I was just about to consult you, Strategist. The soldiers are making a commotion, quite dissatisfied. They demand compensation and want to change the previous agreement. Third Brother volunteered to handle it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“As for Second Brother, he is in the tent absorbing national power to enhance his cultivation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Apart from promotions, the rewards for Liu, Guan, and Zhang included ten units of national power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo became interested: “How is General Guan’s injury?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Before, Wu Hen’s sneak attack had injured Guan Hong’s right arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Just as he spoke, a surge of divine sense was transmitted: “Thank you, Strategist, for your concern. My injury on the right arm is far more troublesome than imagined. I have tried all possible methods in turn, yet without much effect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">It was Guan Hong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Clearly, he had finished his cultivation session.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Liu Er frowned and entered the tent with Ning Zhuo to visit Guan Hong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Inside the tent, it was dimly lit, with a few candles burning. The candlelight was bright red, emanating a blood-like glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Guan Hong wore a dark green robe, but his right arm was exposed. The wound there was visibly swollen, and the flesh bore a blackish-purple hue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“How strange!” Liu Er’s expression turned grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“How strange!” Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Liu Er suddenly cupped his hands toward Ning Zhuo in salute: “Strategist, do you also have knowledge of the strange arts? I have seen that you possess a sickle weapon, surely an outstanding piece among the Night Rain Devil Weapons. In the previous ambush, the sickle easily repelled Wu Hen, displaying formidable power! Please, Strategist, help us.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo nodded: “I have not studied the strange arts much; I merely had good fortune in obtaining a Night Rain Devil Weapon.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo examined the wound, letting his divine sense seep inside. He found that the blackish-purple discoloration was spreading.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“General Guan, may I take a closer look at the wound?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Guan Hong nodded: “Please, Strategist.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Not only was it spreading through the flesh, it was also eroding the surface of the bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Though the wound is not large, if left untreated for a long time, the erosion will cause far more serious injuries.” Liu Er also projected his divine sense, worried and heavy-hearted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He and Guan Hong looked to Ning Zhuo, their gazes carrying unspoken hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo shook his head: “I have a Night Rain Devil Weapon and am skilled only in killing, not in healing such injuries.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“However, though the strange arts are hard to cure, the damage is still limited to the right arm at present. Perhaps General Guan can rely on national power to rapidly increase cultivation and suppress, then crush it in one go?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Guan Hong sighed: “That would be a last resort.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Liu Er spoke immediately: “Second Brother, use all ten units of national power. As for Third Brother’s share, I will make the decision! I will compensate him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Guan Hong was moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo felt curious and could not help asking: “The ten units of national power rewarded by the capital —can it be that they can be given to just one among you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Liu Er nodded: “The imperial decree only stated that these ten units of national power were granted to the three of us. It did not specify who gets how many, nor did it distribute them precisely, so it should be permissible.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“But the four units of national power rewarded to you, Strategist, may only be used by you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">At this point, Liu Er hesitated slightly, then still advised: “Strategist, perhaps you should save them for future use. If you become Shuang Jing’s retainer and then absorb national power, you will surely gain even more from it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Guan Hong froze, then fixed Ning Zhuo with a sharp gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly: “I appreciate your concern, General Liu. Indeed, Lord Shuang Jing told me that if I became his retainer, I would gain triple the effect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Guan Hong could not help but speak: “A true man acts between Heaven and Earth. How could he become someone’s retainer for petty gain?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Strategist, if you want effectiveness, why not earn merit on the battlefield?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“We three brothers rose from guerrilla generals to captor generals, and absorbing national power now yields twice the effect compared to before!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“With your abilities, Strategist, it’s not hard to establish merits on the battlefield. By accumulating achievements and rising in the ranks, you would maintain your freedom!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Otherwise, becoming a retainer and taking orders from another—would that not be stifling?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Liu Er cheered silently in his heart, but outwardly he raised his hand to stop: “Second Brother, say no more.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo smiled: “Thank you, General Guan, for your advice.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“It’s just that Lord Shuang Jing’s offered terms are indeed generous, allowing me to leave at any time. In my view, this retainer identity he offers me is more of a nominal title, with no intent to humiliate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The same unit of national power granted differing yields depending on the person’s status in that country.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Here, “status” referred to a cultivator’s identity within the corresponding nation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">There were both real and nominal titles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Real titles included the miscellaneous generals for the three, as well as the position of strategist for Ning Zhuo. Nominal titles included many more types; certain titles without fiefdoms belonged to this category.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Shuang Jing’s retainer identity was just such a nominal title. But because Shuang Jing’s own status was so exalted, if Ning Zhuo held that identity, he would gain triple the results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Hearing that Shuang Jing did not restrict Ning Zhuo’s freedom, Guan Hong stroked his beard, his face slightly cold: “If I were the Strategist, I would never agree to become Shuang Jing’s retainer!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“Second Brother, hold your tongue. Everyone has their own ambitions —how can we force them?” Liu Er’s face was solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Guan Hong said no more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo showed a hint of embarrassment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Liu Er spoke warmly: “Strategist, my second brother speaks bluntly. Please do not take it to heart. A fine bird chooses a fine tree to nest in, a worthy minister chooses a worthy lord to serve —this is the proper way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“Ah!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“I only regret that my luck is poor and my abilities meager, that I could not achieve more merit to help you gain greater feats, Strategist.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo shook his head: “You speak as if I am about to leave the camp. General Liu, do not worry. Without even mentioning that I will surely travel far and leave the Two Note Kingdom after this war, let’s just say I agreed to Lord Shuang Jing’s offer to become his retainer and broaden my horizons —I would never forget to support the Three Generals’ Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“As soon as my family’s reply arrives, permitting me to allocate the treasures in my hands, I will certainly lend the three generals a helping hand!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo again made a promise. Seeing the atmosphere turn tense, he took his leave and exited the tent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Liu Er watched the door curtain and let out a deep sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He spoke with heartfelt emotion: “Second Brother, it’s my fault!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“Back then at the Pear Garden, Third Brother once invited the Strategist and us to become sworn brothers. If I had insisted then, the Strategist would be our Fourth Brother now. How could he leave us at this moment?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Guan Hong was silent for several breaths before speaking: “Elder Brother, if anyone is to blame, it’s me. I was the one who refused at the time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“I saw that he was so young, and only at the Foundation Establishment stage, and thus I grew arrogant.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“Who would have thought that the Strategist’s talents were astonishing enough to make us all look at him with new eyes. Ah, I, Guan, was blind!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Liu Er hurriedly tried to console Guan Hong again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Seeing that Liu Er still appeared worried, Guan Hong frowned: “Elder Brother, if you are concerned about the Strategist, how could I, your younger brother, not share your worries?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Liu Er was shocked and clutched Guan Hong’s arm: “Second Brother, you must not act rashly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“How about I bear the rod and plead forgiveness, kneeling before the Strategist’s tent, begging him to stay!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“Though the Strategist is talented, you and I are brothers, close as limbs. Wouldn’t humiliating you be the same as humiliating me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“We met and knew each other, fought side by side —how can I let you, a dignified Golden Core, kneel before a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, suffering such indignity?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Ah, I can only blame my lowly status and the Strategist’s noble family background for failing to win his loyalty.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Guan Hong’s eyes reddened: “Elder Brother.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Liu Er gazed deeply at Guan Hong: “Second Brother!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Elder Brother!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">“Second Brother!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">At this moment, Zhang Hei lifted the door curtain and walked in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Seeing this scene, he widened his eyes: “What good things are you two brothers discussing, not including me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Guan Hong said nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Liu Er sighed deeply and explained to Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Zhang Hei’s eyes widened again: “What? The Strategist wants to leave?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">“Not allowed!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“I will go talk to him!! We built this army together, and now he wants to quit halfway?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Liu Er quickly grabbed Zhang Hei’s arm: “Third Brother, do not be so rash. Everyone has their own ambitions, how can we force them?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“Ah, I can only blame my lowly status for not winning his heart.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Elder Brother!!” Zhang Hei’s face was stubborn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Third Brother, listen to Elder Brother,” said Guan Hong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Zhang Hei glanced at Liu Er, then at Guan Hong, then swung a fist into the air and turned to stare at the ground: “Ah!!!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
