<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The white-gold pillar of light broke through the grand formation, surging far into the high heavens!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Situ Gu snapped back to his senses: "Quickly, repair the grand formation!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Confucian cultivators maintaining the scene woke up as if from a dream. Suppressing the shock in their hearts, they hurriedly began to mend the grand formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Situ Gu’s heart stirred, and he immediately sent a divine sense message, quietly commanding: "Repair it slowly. Do not seal off the white rainbow; let everyone in the sect see it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Why were the Confucian cultivators holding this Rising Cloud Trial?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">It was to expand the influence of their group within the Myriad Manifestations Sect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">For a long time, this group, led by Duanmu Zhang, had been severely suppressed by the Qin De incident, making development difficult. The arrival of the teacher-student duo, Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing, had brought them a turning point for change and hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Although Situ Gu had been recruited by Zhao Hansheng and Gu Qing, his fundamental stance was aligned with Duanmu Zhang, Chu Xuangui, Song Taosheng, and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He immediately realized: although Ning Zhuo was not a Confucian cultivator, he had been recommended by Wen Ruanyu! Based on his experience as the top-placer in the first two trials, he was already considered "half of one of their own" by the Confucian group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Moreover, Situ Gu recognized the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone. This was Righteous Qi! This was the manifestation of their Confucian power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Show it off!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Show it off grandly on a stage like the Flying Cloud Assembly. Let everyone in the world see - we Confucian cultivators have power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The white-gold light rainbow stood like a pillar, its upper end disappearing into the thick clouds, persisting without fading, looking as though it were propping up the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The crowd gazed up for a while, then subconsciously lowered their eyes to look at the person involved, Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo was bathed in the pillar of light, standing tall with his chest out. His facial expression couldn't be seen clearly; only the outline of his body was distinct. With his large head slightly raised, one could tell just from his posture that he felt a deep, heartfelt pride - the spirited energy of a youth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">I am the righteous path!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">I am a hero!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Yes, I am just that confident!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Gu Qing stood in the front row, half-turning to glare at Ning Zhuo inside the pillar of light with an awkward posture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Since the start of the third Rising Cloud Trial for Confucian cultivators, this was the first time he had completely lost his composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Such an abundant, terrifying amount of Righteous Qi had actually erupted from Ning Zhuo  - someone who wasn't even a peer among the Confucian cultivators?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Was this even logical?!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="45"/>
<paragraph index="46">The Tea House on the Mountain Peak</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">Zhao Hansheng's movement to sip his tea paused, the cup in his hand stopping mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">His pupils shrank slightly as he turned his head to look out the window.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">He saw the white-gold pillar of gas piercing the sky, its Righteous Qi incredibly prominent - vast and unyielding!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">This Great Scholar from the Kingdom of Huazhang and mentor to Gu Qing felt a sense of unease for the first time: "It’s Righteous Qi... What happened? Is a Great Scholar taking action? Is it Duanmu Zhang?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">"No, I know his aura."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="58"/>
<paragraph index="59">The Confucian Academy</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Duanmu Zhang quickly received the latest intelligence, learning everything that had happened at the trial grounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Ning Zhuo? The White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This Great Scholar revealed a look of surprise, subconsciously looking toward the headquarters of the Demon Subjugation Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Zhong Dao was an old friend of his; both upheld justice and recognized each other as fellow travelers on the same path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Duanmu Zhang hadn't expected Zhong Dao to suddenly lend such a heavy treasure to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He pushed open the door, walked into the small courtyard, and looked at the white-gold pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Sigh." He let out a sigh, his expression containing relief, understanding, and also regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">With Ning Zhuo performing like this, it was completely understandable why Zhong Dao would lend him the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">But Ning Zhuo, in the end, was not a Confucian cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">At this moment, Duanmu Zhang couldn't help but imagine: "How good would it be if Ning Zhuo were an orthodox Confucian cultivator? Looking at the current situation, even if he didn't rely on the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone, he would definitely be able to cultivate Righteous Qi!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Even among Confucian cultivators, only a small portion could cultivate Righteous Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Confucian cultivators were a collective that could be subdivided into many schools. For example, Wang Xinyue's School of Mind was a newly born school.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Those who focused exclusively on cultivating Righteous Qi were equivalent to ascetic cultivators - similar to those in the Buddhist Sect who cultivated the Sutra of Bitter Cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">They were often in difficult straits because every action they took had to align with their own heart, which meant they were often out of step with the outside world. With such a tense relationship with the world, it was hard for a Confucian cultivator to develop by relying solely on themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Clearly, Ning Zhuo was an excellent seed for Righteous Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"But it’s a pity, a real pity. He isn't an orthodox Confucian cultivator."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"What is he practicing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"It seems to be... the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Art?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"What kind of cultivation art is that?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Never heard of it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">At this moment, Duanmu Zhang's feelings of regret were beyond words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="103"/>
<paragraph index="104">The Quiet Courtyard</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">Wen Ruanyu looked up at the sky, his mind also captivated by the white-gold pillar in the heavens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">"Vast and unyielding... it's actually Righteous Qi!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">"Which Great Scholar is taking action?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">"Is it Zhao Hansheng?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">Wen Ruanyu was familiar with Duanmu Zhang's aura. He made the wrong guess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="116"/>
<paragraph index="117">The Main Hall of the Demon Subjugation Hall</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zhong Dao sat in the high seat. Below the platform were over a dozen cultivators, each with a powerful aura; they were all the backbone of the Demon Subjugation Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Hmph!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zhong Dao threw the intelligence jade slip in his hand directly down, slamming it onto the floor tiles and into the hearts of the cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"A bunch of demonic scoundrels taking advantage of this time to cause trouble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Zhao Sitong, in the Cloud Dream Marsh under your jurisdiction, there have already been seven 'Nightmare Soul-Devouring' incidents. These demonic cultivators have infiltrated the dreams of mortals to suck their living souls. The victims appear to be sleeping peacefully but their souls are scattered in their dreams. Now, a fishing village of three hundred people has turned into walking corpses overnight in their sleep! How are you handling things?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Zhao Sitong’s face turned pale: "Hall Master, your subordinate has already deployed more personnel for patrols, but that Nightmare Art is truly impossible to guard against..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Shut up!" Zhong Dao pointed at Zhao Sitong, directly cutting him off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhong Dao looked at another person: "Lin Xiu, eighty-one boys and girls have gone missing in the Iron Hook Mountains you are responsible for. Those demonic cultivators want to cultivate the 'Nine Mother Blood Fiend,' and their goal has long been obvious. Why haven't you produced any results yet?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Lin Xiu showed a difficult expression: "Reporting to the Hall Master, I have already dispatched personnel to search all the caves in the Iron Hook Mountains, blocked the main roads, and looked for altars related to the Blood Fiend. It’s just, it’s just..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Be quiet." Zhong Dao snorted coldly. "I'll just ask you one thing - if you say these words, can you satisfy those parents who lost their children?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Zhong Dao's sharp gaze turned to a third person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Yan Feng! In the Heavenly Snow Ice Plains you manage, 'Ice Corpse Reincarnation' has actually appeared! What have you been watching over? These ancient ice corpses were actually exploited by demonic outsiders? Is your formation skill just for show? Huh?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Yan Feng smiled bitterly: "Hall Master, when this news came back, I wanted to leave the mountain gate immediately and go back to guard the Heavenly Snow Ice Plains. But isn't this during the Flying Cloud Assembly? I can't leave!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Hall Master!" Yan Feng continued, "In fact, we all know that there is nothing we can do about this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Every time the Flying Cloud Assembly happens, our Myriad Manifestations Sect withdraws its strength to guard the main mountain gate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"The demonic outsiders we usually suppress take this opportunity to pop their heads out and cause destruction to race against time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"It’s not just me; in fact, everyone has this kind of difficulty, Hall Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">These words reached the hearts of everyone present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But Zhong Dao became even more furious. He slammed the desk in anger and growled: "Do you think you’re the only smart one? Do you think this Hall Master doesn't know about this situation?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"It is precisely because of this, precisely because the demonic outsiders are taking the opportunity to do evil, that we must show the strength of the righteous path, deal them a heavy blow, and ruthlessly strangle these evil types."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Did I gather you here today to hear your excuses or reasons?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"No!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"We are here to face these problems directly, brainstorm, and solve them!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Yan Feng and the others were criticized so much they couldn't lift their heads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Just then, the magnificent white-gold pillar of light erupted, piercing straight into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Zhong Dao's critical voice paused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The cultivators all looked up; some turned around, and through the open doors of the main hall, they all saw that white-gold pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"What's the situation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"It seems to be... Righteous Qi?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Which Great Scholar is acting? Is it that Zhao-surnamed Great Scholar from the Kingdom of Huazhang?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Everyone speculated in their hearts, gradually feeling the atmosphere become strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Thinking about it, why hadn't Hall Master Zhong Dao continued to berate them?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">They all came back to their senses and saw Zhong Dao squinting his eyes, gazing into the long sky, his expression having softened significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Not bad, not bad," Zhong Dao murmured to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Even though he had personally given the order to lend the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone to Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo's stunning performance this time still exceeded his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">His previous doubts were not established; instead, it further verified that this junior, Ning Zhuo, was outstanding!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo not only had a strong sense of justice but also possessed mature and experienced methods. How rare this was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Seeing such an excellent rising star emerge in the righteous path, Zhong Dao felt very satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"This boy is not bad," Zhong Dao said to himself, the corners of his mouth curling slightly into a very faint smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Good heavens!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">What did I just see?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The Hall Master, who was in a fit of rage, is actually smiling?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Although Zhong Dao's smile flashed and disappeared, the backbones of the hall below still saw it. Zhong Dao's low murmur was also caught by their sharply tuned ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">For a time, huge waves rose in everyone's hearts. They were all guessing who this mysterious junior was, who could be favored by Zhong Dao and make him let go of his anger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">It must be related to this white-gold pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">To be associated with Righteous Qi, he must be one of our own. No wonder the Hall Master favors him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Who exactly is it?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The core members of the Demon Subjugation Hall all had the same thought: after this meeting, they would go all out to investigate and find out who this person was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">This is a talent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">A person who can make Lord Zhong Dao let go of his anger and smile during this sensitive period is simply a treasure of the world!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">This was only the Rising Cloud Trial; the main stage of the Flying Cloud Assembly hadn't even arrived yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">In this time period, their jurisdictions would usually be filled with constant trouble and bad news. Zhong Dao's attitude was predictable, and the pressure on everyone was imaginable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">They simply needed Ning Zhuo too much!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The impact caused by the white-gold pillar was like a giant stone hitting a lake; the waves were spreading widely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="227"/>
<paragraph index="228">Soaring Peak </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">Peak Master Lu Zhenshu had a look of doubt on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">He had attended Zhao Hansheng's public lectures and had also interacted with him privately, even having a small sparring session, so he knew Zhao Hansheng's aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">"It’s not Zhao Hansheng, and it’s not Duanmu Zhang's aura either."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">"Could it be that Gu Qing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">"If it really is so, this young man is quite something."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="240"/>
<paragraph index="241">Sword's Cry Peak</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Peak Master Ling Juejian was training his sword qi. He looked up at the sky, his eyebrows twitching slightly: "Righteous Qi is indeed vast and unyielding. Who is taking action?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"If I put out the same amount of strength, could my sword qi cut through this light pillar?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="247"/>
<paragraph index="248">Myriad Beasts Peak</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">Tuoba Huang was squatting on the ground, feeding the chickens and dogs that covered the floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">His gaze was also drawn to the white-gold pillar. He frowned, feeling quite displeased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">He knew the aura of Duanmu Zhang's spiritual energy, and the white-gold pillar was clearly not it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">"Is it that old scholar from the Kingdom of Huazhang?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">"Bringing his student to participate in the Flying Cloud Assembly, but never wanting to join our Myriad Manifestations Sect. What does he take our sect for?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">"Now he’s actually being this flashy!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">"That old scholar is detestable, bullying our sect for having no one; he is truly arrogant!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="264"/>
<paragraph index="265">Inside the white-gold pillar, Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">His heart was surging with emotion: "The White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone responded to me, and the Righteous Qi has proven me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"I really am a hero of the righteous path!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Through the white-gold pillar, Ning Zhuo could feel countless gazes, burning hot, focused on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"After this, my name will be known throughout the main gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, and I will truly enter the eyes of the upper echelons!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Zhong Dao's proactive lending of the White Rainbow Righteous Integrity Bone had allowed Ning Zhuo to keenly perceive last night: this was a test from Zhong Dao. At the same time, it was also a perfect opportunity for him, Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Ning Zhuo knew how to endure, but he knew even better how to seize an opportunity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The unexpected chance for fame was right before him; he gripped it tightly and gave it his all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">From beginning to end, he believed in himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">He succeeded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">At this moment, he was the most dazzling star on the field, drawing the gazes of countless cultivators throughout the entire Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"At this moment, I am practically the center of the world!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"The atmosphere has reached this point..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">With a stirred heart, Ning Zhuo spoke and recited aloud- </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"In the Rising Cloud Trial, I learn the spiritual chapters, Within the White Rainbow Bone, my heart is laid bare. If only Righteous Qi fills the universe, Why should the green history need to record my deeds? The Myriad Manifestations gateway gains a new talent, Before the Demon Subjugation Hall, the blade is sharpened. If you all ask of my lifelong wish, It is already above the highest azure of the green clouds!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Amidst the gaze of the ten thousand, Ning Zhuo recited a poem. Just then, the white-gold radiance slowly dissipated, revealing the true face of the large-headed youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">He wore a white robe, unstained by a speck of dust, his figure standing tall like a pine. On his young face, a pair of bright eyes shone like stars, flickering with a firm and pure light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Situ Gu slightly opened his mouth, marveling in his heart: "Brimming with righteousness... this boy will surely become a great talent in the future!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Gu Qing stared, extremely speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Ning Zhuo's recited poem echoed continuously in his ears, making his whole brain buzz.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">He had already foreseen trouble, but he hadn't expected Ning Zhuo to cause such a huge commotion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">He was completely stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Gu Qing stopped his work, but Ning Zhuo would not.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">He continued to refine the spiritual paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">His Righteous Qi was practically inexhaustible. He poured it into the paper pulp regardless of the consumption, quickly transforming it into sheets of Righteous Xuan Paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">And every single sheet of Righteous Xuan Paper was of the top grade!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Gu Qing used his own Righteous Qi sparingly, thread by thread. Cultivators like Kong Ran borrowed Situ Gu's Righteous Qi, which was diluted and difficult to mobilize.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Ning Zhuo, using his Righteous Body, produced it from himself. It was as easy to use as his own limbs, and the output was so massive it was practically cheating.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
