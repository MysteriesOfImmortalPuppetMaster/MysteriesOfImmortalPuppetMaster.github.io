<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 207: Xiaohui Requests the Treasure from the Immortal Artisan</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The envoy from the Ning family patriarch came to find Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Xiaohui's expression was not pleasant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">She had been deeply immersed in her cultivation, only to be interrupted by an outsider.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"You better have something important, or else..." Ning Xiaohui looked at the envoy, her gaze dangerous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Her cultivation was stuck at the third level of Qi Refining Stage, but she possessed the Innate Talent Ice Jade Hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The latter was her main focus in cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Not long ago, she participated in the forging of the Zheng family's Mechanical Black Snake Weapon, gaining significant insights, especially in the profound mysteries of the Ice Jade Hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Zheng family's mechanical weapon was extremely fierce, filled with killing intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Xiaohui used her innate talent to help the mechanical weapon survive a deadly situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This forging process had a strong impact on her, and on the night she returned, she discovered that her innate talent had greatly improved, even to the point of being able to repair Golden Core Stage items!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Previously, when her soul entered the Immortal Palace, she could use her innate talent to repair puppet bodies, but the grade of the items repaired by her talent was not high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This time, she found that she even had a certain ability to repair Golden Core Stage items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">When Ning Xiaohui used her Innate Talent Ice Jade Hand, she could freeze damaged items into ice blocks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After the ice melted, the damaged items often had their defects mended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">For example, cracks would be filled, and wounds or flaws would grow and heal like trees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The envoy waited for a long time before finally seeing Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He first brought her good news and then handed her a jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The jade slip contained the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique from the fourth to the sixth layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Good, good, good. With this, I can finally advance to the mid-stage of Qi Refining." "I will have more mana and be able to use my innate talent more frequently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Wait." Suddenly, Ning Xiaohui's expression changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">She thought of a possibility and asked, "How did you get this? After I left, did the three families successfully defeat the Mechanical Ape?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The envoy knew the details and had intended to keep them hidden, but since Ning Xiaohui specifically asked, he had to reveal the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Upon learning that Ning Zhuo was the one who succeeded in the challenge and obtained the subsequent techniques, Ning Xiaohui's brows furrowed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Him?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Xiaohui's lips twitched, still in disbelief: "How could it be Ning Zhuo? How could he have such strength?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Envoy: "He really does..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"In this exploration of the Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo led the charge alone, displaying a variety of techniques." "He led his trusted followers, breaking through all obstacles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"The reformation team followed behind him, only playing a minor role as cannon fodder during the battle with the Mechanical Ape." "Ning Zhuo ultimately repelled the Mechanical Ape, reached the second Dao Gate, and obtained the subsequent techniques." "You should know, the City Lord's Mansion recently revealed that Meng Chong and others were practicing the techniques from the fourth to the sixth layer." "This means that our Ning family's reformation team has caught up with the City Lord's Mansion!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Hmph..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The envoy, filled with strong family pride, spoke with increasing enthusiasm, not noticing the growing dark cloud on Ning Xiaohui's face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Sensing Ning Xiaohui's icy gaze, the envoy immediately shut his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Xiaohui's fingers, gripping the jade slip of the technique, turned white from the force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Good, good, good." Ning Xiaohui gritted her teeth and spat out three words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">For a moment, she didn't know what to say.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">It was because of Ning Zhuo that she was forced to leave the reformation team and take the path of entering the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Since she left, she had been progressing smoothly, even participating in the forging of Golden Core Stage items.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">But Ning Xiaohui was inherently proud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">As a member of the main branch, she couldn't accept being driven away by a branch member.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">She harbored extreme hatred for Ning Zhuo and was determined to seek revenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">She had become a different person since leaving the reformation team, cutting off all leisure and rest, seizing every moment for cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Whenever she was exhausted and felt she couldn't go on, she would think of Ning Zhuo's face, instantly gaining immense motivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Her cultivation was almost maniacal, to the point where even her grandmother couldn't bear to watch, repeatedly forcing her to rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Xiaohui's plan was simple: to cultivate her innate talent madly, preparing to reclaim her honor in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">But now, she suddenly heard of Ning Zhuo's great success!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Xiaohui was deeply shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">She had never imagined that Ning Zhuo would one day catch up with Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">After all, Meng Chong possessed Immortal Talent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But the fact was as it was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Perhaps, in this lifetime, I may never catch up to Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Suddenly, she realized that in the field of mechanical techniques, there was a chasm between her and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The gap was so vast that no matter how hard she worked, she might never close it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Xiaohui, who had always been proud of her main branch status, now realized that she might never surpass Ning Zhuo, a member of the branch family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This realization brought her immense pain and frustration!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The jade slip recording the technique felt cold, but at this moment, Ning Xiaohui found it unbearably hot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">She wanted to throw it away, smash it on the ground, and shout proudly, "This is Ning Zhuo's doing, I disdain it! I will earn the subsequent techniques on my own!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But she couldn't do that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After taking the path of entering the Immortal Palace, she discovered many new opportunities and understood that to obtain the subsequent techniques, she would have to go through the trial checkpoints.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">She no longer had the face to enter the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">If discovered, she would be ostracized and ridiculed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Being ostracized was one thing, but the thought of being mocked by other trial disciples made Ning Xiaohui lose the courage to enter the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">This feeling was worse than death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">She couldn't bear it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"So, to seek the subsequent techniques, I can only rely on Ning Zhuo's."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Damn it, damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Xiaohui, knowing shame and courage, wanted to become stronger, desperately wanted to become stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">But to become stronger, she had to practice the subsequent techniques obtained by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">This made Ning Xiaohui feel like she had swallowed a fly, extremely uncomfortable and awkward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The envoy, observing her expression, quickly tried to comfort her, informing her that the subsequent techniques had already been purchased by the Ning family patriarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"What?!" Ning Xiaohui was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">She immediately felt much better!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">She snorted coldly, disparagingly: "This Ning Zhuo is so selfish and self-serving." "He is a member of the Ning family, raised under the family's protection, and now he uses his achievements to leverage the family?" "Where is his loyalty?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"He actually dares to openly trade these things with the family?" "What does he take the family for? A white-eyed wolf!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Xiaohui had never seen such behavior from a branch member!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo's actions made her extremely disgusted and repulsed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The envoy, bracing himself, said, "The jade slip of the technique has been brought. There is also another important matter concerning the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman." "Under the patriarch's orders, I am here to retrieve this talisman from you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Xiaohui was taken aback: "What?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"No way." She instinctively opposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">She had always kept the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman close, using her innate talent and mana to nurture and refine it daily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Suddenly, the family wanted to take the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman, leaving Ning Xiaohui unprepared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">She felt puzzled: "Why? I just got the subsequent techniques and am about to practice diligently. I need the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The envoy hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Xiaohui, being smart, thought of a possibility and showed a hint of anger: "What do you mean?" "Are you planning to give the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman to Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Exactly!" The envoy sighed, his face full of bitterness, "This is part of the deal between Ning Zhuo and the patriarch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Outrageous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"A branch member dares to make such demands, how audacious!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"The patriarch actually conceded to this extent? So weak? Letting a mere branch member ride roughshod over us?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Xiaohui screamed in anger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"The Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman contains spirituality and is a family treasure. It should be used by the main branch first, not given to a branch member?" "This is turning the world upside down!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Who is really in charge of the Ning family?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Xiaohui's face turned livid as she scolded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The envoy lowered his head, silently enduring the scolding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He had anticipated Ning Xiaohui's reaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Xiaohui cursed Ning Zhuo fiercely for a long time, until she was exhausted and stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The envoy took the opportunity to explain that he was just a small figure, and the order was made by the patriarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He pleaded with Ning Xiaohui not to make things difficult for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly: "Wait here, I will go talk to my grandmother about this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">However, when Ning Xiaohui's grandmother heard about this, she instead persuaded Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Ning Zhuo is not someone to be trifled with."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"He has many means, and there are experts from the branch family guiding him. Even Ning Xiaoren, the young patriarch, was brought down by him." "Now, he controls the black market, with many Foundation Establishment elites under him, and the entire branch family stands behind him." "He also has close ties with the Zhou and Zheng families."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Most importantly, he has caught the eye of our family's ancestor. The latter publicly stated that Ning Zhuo has contributed to our Ning family!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Xiaohui, a gentleman's revenge is never too late."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Right now, Ning Zhuo is in the limelight. We can bide our time, wait for his momentum to wane, and then take revenge. It's not too late." "A small impatience will spoil great plans. It's okay to endure for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Xiaohui pouted, holding her grandmother's arm, shaking it and acting coquettishly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">But this time, her grandmother was resolute: "Xiaohui, how do you compare to Ning Xiaoren?" "If you go against him at this critical moment, you might end up in prison too!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Xiaohui's face turned pale: "Grandmother, with you protecting me, how could I..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Her grandmother interrupted directly: "I am just an elder. Look at the patriarch, his status is much higher and more important than mine. Did he manage to protect his own son?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Xiaohui's lips trembled, unable to respond for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">In the end, she handed the Flowing Clouds and Water Talisman to the envoy with a livid face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The envoy, having obtained the talisman, quickly took his leave, not daring to stay any longer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Xiaohui watched the envoy's departing figure, almost grinding her teeth to pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"I will repay today's humiliation a hundredfold!" "Hmph, your good days won't last long."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"I have discovered that entering the Immortal Palace is the key. Once I accumulate enough contributions, I can exchange for a position in the Immortal Palace." "The highest position should be the Palace Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"I have the Innate Talent Ice Jade Hand and am close to meeting the standard to exchange for the position of a healer." "With the healer position, my contribution accumulation speed will increase by more than five times, and I will progress rapidly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"My future cultivation, contributions, and position will all crush you!" "I remember all our grievances clearly." "One day, I will settle the score with you!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
