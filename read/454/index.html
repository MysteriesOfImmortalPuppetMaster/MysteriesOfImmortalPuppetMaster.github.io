<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 454: I Am Very Interested in Ning Zhuo</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Lord Long coughed lightly, stood up, and cupped his hands toward the Old Stone Monster: “This battle nearly cost me my life, and I am fortunate to have been saved by Fellow Daoist Shi.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Such a gesture was extremely rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Usually, Lord Long had his eyes set above the heavens and was arrogant in demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He himself was a great Nascent Soul cultivator, and very senior at that. Even more crucially, as the temple caretaker of the Ginseng-whisker Dragon King, he had an exceedingly solid backing, making him second only to one person and above thousands in the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Yet this time, he actually cupped his hands in thanks to the Old Stone Monster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Mo Yuan Cave Master, Red Vine Doctor, Azure Vine King, and the others looked toward the stone sphere, all wearing expressions of envy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Everyone knew that once they returned to the Thousand Peaks Forest, the Old Stone Monster would receive the Dragon King’s great reward!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The next moment, the Old Stone Monster’s hoarse voice sounded: “Little Long, I am your savior. You, as the main general, if you had died, even if we had completely wiped out two or three enemy armies in this battle, it would still have been a disastrous loss!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“I was the key figure who turned the tide, changing defeat into victory.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“What kind of reward do you think the Dragon King will grant such a meritorious subject?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Everyone’s expressions changed dramatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">They had not expected the Old Stone Monster to speak so bluntly and with such an impolite tone, his manner completely one of flaunting his achievement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">This was not a wise move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Although it was true that he had saved Lord Long, one should not act like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After all, the other party was not just a Nascent Soul cultivator; he was also the temple caretaker of the Dragon King. Treating him so rudely was equivalent to being rude to a Soul Formation level existence!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Lord Long’s eyelid twitched slightly. He lowered his hand, a smile appearing on his face, and said slowly, “Well said, well said.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“Fellow Daoist Shi, rest assured. Although I cannot decide on the reward, I trust the Dragon King will certainly not treat you unfairly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The two of them had been entangled with the Barbarian Demon Camp all along, holding the upper hand, so their withdrawal went very smoothly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Old Stone Monster grunted, arrogance clear: “That’s good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">While he spoke, more cultivators arrived secretly to rendezvous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">They were Di Lu and Gu Ya.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Di Lu’s face was expressionless: “What a pity. That Xu Dali was already at his last gasp. If we had just one more incense stick of time, we would surely have taken him down!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Gu Ya said nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Compared to his eagerness before the battle, he now seemed depressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Gu Ya was a beast tamer who put great care into his wolf pack. In this battle, his wolves suffered heavy losses, which pained him greatly and made him fully realize one point—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">If one truly wanted group warfare, an army composed of cultivators possessed the strongest combat power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Using a pack of demonic beasts to contend against an army required at least a tenfold numerical advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">While everyone exchanged words, Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and others also arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">They wore anxious expressions and looked quite battered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“We underestimated the Three Generals Camp. Although Liu, Guan, and Zhang are itinerant cultivators, none of them are ordinary.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“Where is Ma Feitui?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“He was captured alive by the three generals.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“What?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">For a moment, everyone was extremely startled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ma Feitui was a demon cultivator. His original form was a heavenly horse, and his cultivation had reached Nascent Soul. Even if he could not win, he should have been able to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">They had not expected him to be defeated and even captured alive!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Everyone’s expressions looked unpleasant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Every piece of Nascent Soul-level combat power was extremely precious. Losing Ma Feitui was undoubtedly a great blow to the Thousand Peaks Forest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">A venomous snake emerged from the ground, spitting out a jade slip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">It was a letter from Tu Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Lord Long read it with his divine sense: “Tu Ming is seriously injured and has led the Hundred Venom Tribe to withdraw first. We need not wait for them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Thus, on the Thousand Peaks Forest’s side, one Nascent Soul was seriously injured, one was lost, and their accomplishment was nearly wiping out the Barbarian Demon Camp and the White Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Red Flower Camp suffered heavy losses, the Three Generals Camp was reduced in number, while the Golden Halberd Army and the Fiery Cloud Camp were unscathed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Mo Yuan Cave Master swept his gaze around and immediately laughed: “Ma Feitui is truly ridiculous. I said long ago that his name was too apt. From that alone, one could see his weakness —he has achieved almost nothing after dealing with the Mu General’s House for so many years.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Now he has failed and been captured, and it was done by three obscure itinerant cultivators named Liu, Guan, and Zhang. This further proves my judgment!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“He is a northern demon. There are no such weak Nascent Soul cultivators in the Thousand Peaks Forest. Getting caught might actually be a good thing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“At least, we will not entrust him with important tasks in the future and be dragged down by him, resulting in more severe consequences!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Without a doubt, Lu Hongtu understood how to encourage people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">He had led the Six Caverns Faction for many years, and his eloquence was superb. When he described the defeat, it somehow turned into a fortunate event for the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Lord Long waved his hand: “Enough, let us head back first. Ma Feitui’s defeat and capture was something I never expected. How to handle this matter will be discussed further when we return.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Old Stone Monster then spoke in a mocking tone: “The two note Nation is truly powerful. Even their rear army alone is already so formidable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“Don’t forget, if not for me, Little Long, your end would have been far worse than Ma Feitui’s.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“At least he was captured alive, still clinging to a small life. If I had come even a moment later, you would have been burned to ash.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Lord Long’s eyelid twitched once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Di Lu and Gu Ya were shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Chen Lingfeng, Wu Hen, and the other Golden Core cultivators widened their eyes, their breath catching in their throats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">What was with the Old Stone Monster? How unbelievably arrogant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">A strong sense of foreboding suddenly rose in Lord Long’s heart. It seemed that in the future, every time he met with the Old Stone Monster, the latter would bring up this lifesaving deed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The Old Stone Monster ignored the heavy atmosphere and continued, “You all go on. I’ll stay behind and cover your retreat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Lu Hongtu was surprised: “Fellow Daoist Shi, you won’t return with us?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“There’s no need. Having been still for too long, I want to go out and stroll around the outside world,” Ning Zhuo replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Lu Hongtu’s face was full of worry: “Just now we ambushed the two principalities’ armies. Next, they will surely be enraged and conduct a full-scale search. For you to remain now would be very risky, Fellow Daoist Shi.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Old Stone Monster chuckled: “That is my own affair; do not prattle on. After this battle, there is someone in the enemy army who interests me greatly. I want to investigate him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Lu Hongtu, I have heard that your Six Caverns Faction has much entanglement with that person.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Mo Yuan Cave Master’s expression shifted: “Fellow Daoist Shi, do you mean that Ning...”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Precisely, him, Ning Zhuo,” Ning Zhuo spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">At the side, Sun Lingtong widened his eyes, looking at him curiously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo murmured softly: </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Horses’ hooves tread upon fallen flowers,”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“The wind rises, shadows sink into sand.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Who can keep the bright moon,”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“And who will be buried in rosy clouds?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“This was the prophetic poem Ning Zhuo deduced, and it was very accurate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“Horses’ hooves corresponded to Ma Feitui. Fallen flowers foretold Ma Feitui’s downfall.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“The rising wind and sinking shadows in the sand reflected our side’s offensive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“The bright moon should point to the White Jade Camp’s Many-Stars-Encircle-the-Moon battle formation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">“Buried in rosy clouds refers to how Little Long almost croaked, nearly burned to ash by the Lifeless Fire.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">All hearts jumped in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">You still say such things!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">And you’re becoming even more excessive, not the least bit tactful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Lord Long’s eyelid twitched yet again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Did his face mean nothing?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">But the problem was that the Old Stone Monster truly was his savior!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">For a moment, Lord Long’s sense of unease about the future became even stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“Who can keep the bright moon, who will be buried in rosy clouds? The more I savor these lines, the more marvelous they seem!” Ning Zhuo, disguised as the Old Stone Monster, became increasingly enthusiastic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">At the side, Sun Lingtong cast a glance at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">It was the first time he had seen someone so sincerely boasting about himself!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Not a hint of shame. Little Zhuo’s righteous path skill has risen again,” Sun Lingtong inwardly praised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Outside, the Old Stone Monster’s voice echoed in everyone’s ears: “This last line of the prophetic poem actually points out that one should not only look at the surface of the battle. Occupying the upper hand or having an advantage is not everything. One must see the final outcome.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">“Look at Little Long. He charged alone into the enemy formation, so majestic, yet how did it end? Did he not almost die and need my rescue?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Lord Long secretly ground his teeth. In such a short time, Ning Zhuo had mentioned this rescue three times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Di Lu, Gu Ya, and the others dared not even glance sideways to gauge Lord Long’s expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Chen Lingfeng and Wu Hen, both subordinates of Lord Long, wished they could bury themselves in the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Lu Hongtu said, “But, Fellow Daoist Shi, you may not know that precisely after we heard this poem, we deliberately planned our offensive to match the first half of it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo laughed aloud: “Superficial!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">“You underestimate the Dao of divination, Mo Yuan Cave Master.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“You think you are countering his plan by following the poem, yet you ignore one possibility —that Ning Zhuo had already foreseen your existence and thus deduced this prophetic poem.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Hiss…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Someone drew in a sharp breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Lu Hongtu’s pupils shook slightly, but he quickly composed himself, not fooled by this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He smiled and shook his head: “The likelihood of that is not high. Ning Zhuo is merely a small Foundation Establishment cultivator; how could he possibly calculate someone like me, a Nascent Soul?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Moreover, it was not just me who participated in this ambush, but all of us here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Could a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator have predicted us all?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Everyone’s expressions eased slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo said, “In the Dao of divination, is it impossible for the weak to divine the strong?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He knew he should not push too hard, so he changed tack: “Of course, I also think that this is only a possibility.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“That’s why I find that little fellow interesting.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“I will remain outside to ponder him carefully.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“He is already my prey. Heh heh heh, hahahaha!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Old Stone Monster let out a strange laugh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">No one spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Chen Lingfeng and the other Golden Core cultivators had already begun silently mourning for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Lu Hongtu smiled: “For a small Foundation Establishment cultivator to be so highly regarded by you, Fellow Daoist Shi, what good fortune he has.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">After this battle, the prophetic poem would surely make Ning Zhuo’s name soar, garnering great attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“After this battle, I am also concerned about him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">“Since Fellow Daoist Shi will personally take action, we can rest assured.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Inside the Dragon Head Cabin of the mechanical roaming dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Sun Lingtong gave Ning Zhuo a thumbs-up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">This move was brilliant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo had used the Old Stone Monster’s identity as a protective umbrella, blocking any hidden tricks the Thousand Peaks Forest might direct at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">This could be called a masterful stroke!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Ning Zhuo said, “Let’s go.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">With that, he focused his mind, preparing to cast Earth Movement Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Being among so many Nascent Souls and Golden Cores, pretending to be one of them was enormous pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo decided to withdraw quickly to avoid exposing any flaws as time went on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">“Hold on!” Lord Long suddenly said.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
