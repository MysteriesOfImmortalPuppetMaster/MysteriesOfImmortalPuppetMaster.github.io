<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Three Generals Battalion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The soldiers formed battle formations, orderly arranged, resembling a thick python slowly traversing the mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Liu Er rode a yellow horse, gently stroking the Xuanhuang Sword in his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This treasured sword was heavy and blunt; its blade was earthy yellow with black patterns on the surface, resembling the roots of the earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The hilt was black, with circles of earthy yellow rings spaced apart, containing the essence of sedimentation and protection in the way of the earth element.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo had gifted Liu Er the Xuanhuang Mother Stone, which was crafted by the national craftsman Jin Li using the weapon blueprint provided by Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This was not a magical artifact but a weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Magical artifacts focus more on the casting of spells, while weapons contain military tactics that mostly affect people and objects, imposing positive or negative influences on them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Spells and military tactics were hard to integrate; basically, one could only choose one as the content for crafting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In practical use, cultivators would not forcibly combine spells and military tactics into one magical artifact. The difficulty was too great, and the cost was too high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">With such resources, it was better to craft magical artifacts and weapons separately!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Liu Er held the sword hilt, feeling the heaviness and power of the Xuanhuang Sword. In a trance, he seemed to sense the pulse of the earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Truly worthy of being a weapon personally made by Jin Li."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Liu Er was fond of this weapon, knowing that in this campaign to establish merits, he would rely heavily on this treasured sword in battlefield slaughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">In the shadows cast on the ground by him and his mount, a pair of eyes quietly opened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It was Wu Hen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Wu Hen's eyes were filled with black blood vessels, appearing eerie and gloomy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Wu Hen observed Liu Er, feeling quite speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Obviously, the Xuanhuang Sword was a heavy, blunt weaponâ€”a treasure for defense. Liu Er held the hilt with one hand and stroked the blade with the other. How could Wu Hen launch a surprise attack?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">There was simply no opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">If Wu Hen were acting alone, he might choose to continue observing, waiting for Liu Er to sheathe the sword and expose a flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">But now, many Golden Core cultivators like Chen Lingfeng were waiting for him to make a move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Wu Hen decisively gave up on Liu Er and leaped between shadows. Sometimes, he waited for the moment when the cultivators' shadows connected with the surrounding trees and rocks to transfer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ordinary stealth techniques couldn't achieve his level of excellence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">This was because when the soldiers of the Three Generals Battalion marched, they were always in formation. Military power flowed; the army was organized, possessing the might of national defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Very few stealth techniques could move among them. Most scouts with some skill could only risk getting close for a short distance and observe cautiously from afar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Wu Hen searched all the way and found a strong man in the middle of the team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">This burly man was eight feet tall, with a short thick neck, a face full of black beard like steel needles, and a surging Golden Core aura. He was Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Zhang Hei was riding a black horse, holding a whip. He was not stealthily advancing with the army but was standing by the roadside, observing the military formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Whenever he saw individual cultivators moving slowly, distracted, or slacking off, he would whip them directly while cursing loudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Move faster!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Still slacking off during formation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Hey! How dare you glare at me?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Zhang Hei was quite hot-tempered towards disobedient soldiers. The whip caused the soldiers to scream constantly, but it did make them more alert, their movements quicker and more standard, maintaining the stability of the straight snake formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Wu Hen watched from afar and did not approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Seeing Zhang Hei constantly whipping the soldiers, he felt quite speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhang Hei was furious, his aura surging, tension high; he didn't look like someone easy to ambush.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">At this moment, Zhang Hei's whip suddenly stopped. He only pointed and cursed with the whip, restraining himself a lot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">While Wu Hen was puzzled, he saw a carriage advancing along the team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">When the carriage reached Zhang Hei, a small window on the carriage opened, revealing a young cultivator with a fair face and bright eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The young man said to Zhang Hei in a helpless tone, "General Zhang, I've heard your cursing from afar. Are you whipping the soldiers again?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Zhang Hei hurriedly denied, "No, no. Since the military advisor complained to Brother Xiang, I hardly do such things anymore."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The young man shook his head, "Listening to General Zhang, it seems you blame me for complaining?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhang Hei denied again, "How could that be!? The military advisor is naturally thinking of our army. I, Old Hei, have always been mindful of the advisor's goodness. Look at my Black Snake Spear. Without the treasured materials gifted by the military advisor, how could it have been crafted?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Sigh, General Zhang, please take care of yourself." Ning Zhuo let go of the curtain and returned to being alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">His carriage was arranged with a formation; the space was the size of a room, not as cramped as it appeared from the outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">In the entire Three Generals Battalion, only he currently had such special treatment. Even the three Golden Core generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang were riding Foundation Establishment-level warhorses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Wu Hen's heart moved: "He is Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Comparing with the information in his mind, Wu Hen confirmed his guess.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">He had a thought and immediately attached himself to the large shadow of the carriage, silently sneaking into the carriage without anyone noticing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Wu Hen: !!?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">As soon as he entered the carriage, he was shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He saw Ning Zhuo sitting, leaning against the carriage wall, his head lowered, studying mechanism books.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">To his left stood a mechanical ape, clad in heavy armor, exuding a strong blood aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">On the seat to his right sat a mechanical puppet in the form of an adult woman with Golden Core aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Whether it was the mechanical ape or the female puppet, both made Wu Hen feel they were not easy to provoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">What caught his attention the most was the long mechanical scythe held in the hand of the female puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">From this mechanical scythe, Wu Hen sensed the Dao and principles he was very familiar with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">That was the Dao related to "Monsters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Night Rain Demon Soldier?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"And an extraordinary Night Rain Demon Soldier!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Wu Hen's heart was pounding, unable to stay calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He relied on his special cultivation techniques and spells related to Monsters to infiltrate the Three Generals Battalion and sneak into Canglin Immortal City to gather intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">This was because cultivation techniques and spells related to Monsters were hard to understand and even harder to cultivate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Therefore, most cultivators lacked understanding and found it difficult to comprehend, naturally making it hard to guard against such methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Compared to cultivating himself to success, a more practical and feasible way was to collect related magical artifacts for research and use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Therefore, since the Night Rain Dynasty, many powerful cultivators had been widely collecting Night Rain Demon Soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Wu Hen held his breath and carefully left the carriage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The female mechanical puppet emitted a Golden Core aura and held an extraordinary Night Rain Demon Soldier. Wu Hen had no confidence to assassinate Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Even if the assassination succeeded, the spells he relied on would no longer have the advantage in front of the scythe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Once he was entangled and the entire army surrounded him, could Wu Hen still escape alive?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He had infiltrated here to earn battle merits, not to commit suicide!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Therefore, Ning Zhuo was not a suitable target either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Wu Hen left the carriage somewhat awkwardly and moved along the team all the way to the end, where he saw Guan Hong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Guan Hong sat on a red-maned horse, not stroking his weapon, the Blood Dragon Blade, nor scolding the soldiers, but... combing his beard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">His beard was thick and eight zhang long, jet-black and shiny, almost dragging on the ground as he moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Guan Hong would take out some time every day to groom his long beard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Seeing this, Wu Hen's heart lifted; he finally found a suitable target!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He immediately hid in the shadow of the red-maned horse, silently brewing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Spellâ€”Seamless Shadow Cut!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">At this moment, the shadow under Guan Hong suddenly expanded, and Wu Hen emerged from it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">His face was withered and pale, his long black hair disheveled, wearing a tattered black robe. The edges of his robe and the ends of his hair were attached with shadows, forming a lingering connection between him and Guan Hong's shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Wu Hen's magical power gushed from his hand, transforming into a pair of scissors, fiercely cutting towards Guan Hong's neck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">If this cut landed, Guan Hong's head would be severed like his shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">At the life-and-death moment, Guan Hong's heart pounded wildly, his mind seized by an incomparable sense of crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">At the same time, the soldiers marching behind him saw Wu Hen and exclaimed in surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Guan Hong didn't have time to turn his head. His divine sense concentrated, detecting the previously undetectable Wu Hen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He "saw" Wu Hen about to cut his neck and instinctively raised his right arm to meet the scissors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Reflected on the ground, Guan Hong's raised right arm met the tip of the scissors in advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Guan Hong felt excruciating pain!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">And Wu Hen felt the scissors pierce into flesh, difficult to pull out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">He could only go with the flow and close the scissor blades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Even as tough as Guan Hong was, he groaned in pain. The wound on his right arm appeared, a huge gash almost severing his arm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With rich combat experience, he didn't think twice and drew out the Blood Dragon Blade with his left hand, slashing towards Wu Hen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Wu Hen laughed eerily and directly dived into the horse's shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Blade Techniqueâ€”Hundred Zhang Pursuit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The blood-colored blade light locked onto Wu Hen, following into the horse's shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">The next moment, Guan Hong's mount, the red-maned horse, neighed miserably and suddenly exploded, flesh and blood flying, blade energy wildly raging in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Guan Hong had clearly locked onto Wu Hen, but instead, he had mistakenly struck his own mount.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">He was seriously injured, failed to counterattack Wu Hen, and caused his mount to perish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">After making his move, Wu Hen immediately moved through the shadows, fleeing frantically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Numerous spells bombarded the ground but didn't harm him in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">After a dozen breaths, he successfully escaped the enemy army, fully displaying the style of the Monster Dao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Because the soldiers attacked Wu Hen, the formation fell into chaos, causing the straight snake formation of the Three Generals Battalion to malfunction, revealing a significant flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Seeing this commotion, several Golden Core cultivators who had been waiting outside took action together!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">In an instant, several spells blasted towards the soldiers of the Three Generals Battalion from four directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The Three Generals Battalion had always been in formation and reacted instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Liu Er and Zhang Hei acted simultaneously, each intercepting a spell in mid-air. Guan Hong was injured, acted a beat slower, and only intercepted half.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo ordered Yuan Dasheng to take action, who only bore most of the spell's power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The remaining two or three spells struck the soldiers, killing... more than thirty cultivators on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
