<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 752: Bronze Swords</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo differed from geniuses like Situ Xing and Ban Ji in one key aspect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Situ Xing, Ban Ji, and others had long been renowned within the Flying Cloud Kingdom, serving as the public faces of their respective factions during the Foundation Establishment Stage. Consequently, extensive information about them was widely known.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In contrast, Ning Zhuo was a newcomer from abroad, having burst onto the scene with astonishing speed. While information about him sold briskly in the Trading Hall, it was always priced at the lowest tier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This was because the available intelligence only covered Ning Zhuo's activities after arriving at the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate, making its overall value limited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">As a result, people knew very little about Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">His true strengths, precise age, and country of origin remained largely unknown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Although Ning Zhuo had stated his name, main cultivation art (the Five Elements Qi Rhythm Manual), and mid-Foundation Establishment cultivation level during the wooden and stone tablet registration stages, all of this could easily be falsified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The Myriad Manifestations Sect's regulations lacked strict verification procedures at these early stages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">However, during the later registration phases, the sect would employ rigorous detection methods to uncover lies, disguises, and other deceptions. Only at that point would the cultivators' information become truly reliable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Therefore, the cultivators overseeing the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor trials focused much of their attention on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo's initial performance against the Bronze Sword left everyone stunned and deeply disappointed. However, his astonishing comprehension and subsequent mastery of the situation left the hidden observers in awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"His physical body's foundation is remarkably strong. The Bronze Sword is a Profound Armament Armor, exceptionally sharp, yet even after inflicting severe wounds, they heal rapidly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"He could easily overpower the Bronze Sword, so why is he stalling?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"He's learning, isn't he?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">As they watched, it became clear that Ning Zhuo's close combat skills were improving rapidly in the heat of battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"What cultivation art does Ning Zhuo specialize in? The intelligence reports claim he focuses on a Five Elements technique, but judging by his physical body's foundation, he likely specializes in the Essence Sea."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"If he specializes in the Essence Sea, akin to a Body Cultivator, why is his close combat so weak? It doesn't make sense."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Perhaps he's focused his efforts on other areas and neglected martial arts entirely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"That's unlikely! How old is he? Forty or fifty? How could he have spent so many years without even dabbling in close combat or martial arts? How did he cultivate during the Qi Refining Stage? His background must be formidable, with powerful backing. If he were carefully nurtured, how could such a glaring weakness have been allowed to persist?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Cultivators in the Qi Refining Stage had lifespans only slightly longer than ordinary humans, typically living to around a hundred years old.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Upon reaching the Foundation Establishment Stage, a cultivator's lifespan doubled, extending to approximately two to three hundred years. For someone in their forties or fifties at this stage, it was equivalent to being a teenager between ten and twenty years old.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Some middle-aged or elderly Qi Refining Stage cultivators who advanced to Foundation Establishment experienced a qualitative change in their life force, rejuvenating to a younger appearance to varying degrees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">In the lifespan of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the forties and fifties represented their adolescent phase. Achieving Foundation Establishment at this age was undoubtedly a sign of exceptional talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Therefore, despite their youthful appearances, individuals like Situ Xing, Lin Jinglong, and Shen Xi were all around forty years old.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo, though appearing as a teenager, possessed an extraordinary and mature demeanor. His rich experiences, from enduring hardship since the age of two to plotting grand schemes, traveling the world after leaving Fire Persimmon Immortal City, participating in wars, and confronting the Soul Formation Level Underworld Monarch, were evident in his calm and composed bearing. Any discerning observer would recognize his true worth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">As a result, the assembled cultivators vastly overestimated his actual age.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"After forty or fifty years of cultivation, his Martial Technique shouldn't be this poor, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Regardless of any special circumstances, this alone suggests he's not a Martial Cultivator. Whether he's a Body Cultivator is another matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"He's fought too few times in the Martial Arts Hall - only a handful of times, really. Some of those matches were even closed to the public."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"In his battle against the Tiger Demon, he used a Golden Core-level ice-attribute Mechanical Puppet. But that doesn't tell us much; he specializes in Mechanical Arts, after all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Everyone assumed Ning Zhuo came from a major power, comparable to the Ban Clan or Pi Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">They categorized him as similar to Ban Ji or Situ Xing - the public face of a major power during the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">In such cases, it would be perfectly normal for a major power to provide Ning Zhuo with a Golden Core-level Mechanical Puppet for protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Actually, once he fights a few more times in the Martial Arts Hall, his true capabilities will inevitably be revealed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Just as the Demon Subjugation Hall had the Rising Cloud Trials, the Martial Arts Hall had its own version.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">In fact, during the early stages of each Grand Assembly, the Martial Arts Hall's trials were considered the most crucial of all the Rising Cloud Trials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Countless ambitious cultivators chose this grand stage to showcase their talents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Geniuses never shied away from battle. Within the Martial Arts Hall, they clashed fiercely, suppressing their rivals while enhancing their own reputations and reaping the rewards that followed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In the Martial Arts Hall's trials, the more impressive one's performance, the greater the rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The top spot in these trials held immense prestige.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Many believed Ning Zhuo was being too modest and would undoubtedly become a regular at the Martial Arts Hall in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Of course, this was understandable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">For now, newcomers were actively participating in the Rising Cloud Trials across various venues, and the Martial Arts Hall hadn't yet reached its peak activity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"I'm really looking forward to Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji's clash in the Martial Arts Hall. It's bound to be spectacular!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"What's there to look forward to? If that fight happens, too much of his information will be leaked. How much can we sell what we've gathered so far?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Many of the cultivators overseeing the trials held Jade Slips, recording the performances of cultivators across different venues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo's actions from the beginning until now had been meticulously recorded on numerous Jade Slips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Cultivators often earned substantial profits by selling these Jade Slips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The battle on Ning Zhuo's side had calmed, gradually becoming peaceful. The cultivators' attention shifted to the other participants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Tie Zheng strode forward, his expression impassive, carrying a massive blade with a qilin-headed hilt on his back. He already wielded a sword and a saber, having decisively defeated two sets of Profound Armament Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Lu Zeng, wielding a bronze hammer, was locked in a fierce clash with a bronze spear, now completely dominating the exchange. The ruler emblem on his chest occasionally flashed faintly, a constant reminder that he was being observed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Lu Zeng understood perfectly: "My current battle is likely being recorded in multiple Jade Slips."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The Rising Cloud Trials attract countless cultivators, and the more participants there are, the more information leaks out."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"This process is also how the Myriad Manifestations Sect assesses its new recruits."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This was the price they had to pay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Meanwhile, Ao Pan cracked his Bronze Whip with a resounding snap. His opponent, a bronze staff, retreated step by step despite its frantic attempts to defend itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The whip, as agile as a serpent, suddenly coiled around the staff. With a sharp tug, Ao Pan pulled the staff toward himself, seized it, and channeled his surging energy into forcibly refining it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The staff struggled violently, but its resistance gradually weakened until it fell completely still, claimed by Ao Pan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Among the cultivators watching from the shadows, someone whispered, "Ao Pan has already claimed three sets of Ninefold Profound Armament Armor. Even in the past, such speed was rare."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Someone who had been closely observing Ao Pan introduced him: "His whip technique is extraordinary. In the first match against the Bronze Whip, he had to rely on his fists and feet. But in the second and third matches, he remained rooted to the spot from start to finish, never taking a single step."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Clearly, the previous Profound Armament Armor had posed no challenge to Ao Pan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">An elder murmured thoughtfully, "His mastery of the whip is at least at the level of a renowned master, and it's possible he's even reached the grandmaster level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">A cultivator beside the elder interjected, "He introduced himself as being from the Subduing Waves Kingdom. Following that lead should allow us to uncover more information about him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ao Pan sheathed the Bronze Whip and twirled the Bronze Sword a few times. This brief display revealed his profound skill with the sword as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">After a moment's consideration, Ao Pan stowed the battered Bronze Whip and continued onward, carrying the Bronze Sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">As a Golden Core-level Body Cultivator, he excelled in whip techniques but was also proficient with other weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">In truth, Ao Pan had risen from humble beginnings as a fisherman who joined a ship gang. Even as a mortal, he had relied on knives, spears, and harpoons - these were the tools that had paved his path to success. For him, the Rising Cloud Trials of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor were perfectly suited to his strengths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">This was the second trial within the Profound Armor Cave. Even with his cultivation suppressed, Ao Pan maintained his lead thanks to his deep martial arts foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Some cultivators turned their attention back to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Why is he still struggling with that Bronze Sword?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Hurry up and refine it! You need to move on to the next round. If you keep dragging this out, you'll be eliminated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Some secretly worried for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">On one hand, they preferred Ning Zhuo, who walked the Righteous Path, over Ban Ji. On the other hand, they hoped he would advance further, revealing more personal information that they could profit from by selling intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Having a clear overview of the situation, they knew Ning Zhuo was falling far behind the main group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ban Ji, Zhang Wangxing, and the Rust Disaster Craftsman had already claimed their first bronze weapon and were now vying for their second, having gained the upper hand in their current battles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo was still struggling with his first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"What's he wasting time on?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"He's learning! His close-combat skills are improving rapidly, you can see it with the naked eye."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Studying while taking the exam? He's too confident."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"He must have immense faith in his learning ability. Perhaps that's what makes him a genius. We can't judge him by ordinary standards!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">More and more cultivators shifted their attention away from Ning Zhuo. After all, observing others was far more interesting than watching him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">A moment later, Ning Zhuo suddenly stepped forward, his body twisting slightly to evade the Bronze Sword's thrust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Seizing the opportunity, he gripped the sword's hilt firmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The Bronze Sword struggled violently, but its resistance quickly waned as Ning Zhuo completely refined it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A cultivator who witnessed this blinked in disbelief, a suspicious expression crossing his face. "What did I just see? Did Ning Zhuo refine that Profound Armament Armor at an abnormally fast pace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Divine Refinement! Qi Refinement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo employed both methods simultaneously, subduing the Bronze Sword in a mere three breaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He could have been even faster. The Three Sects' Supreme Methods allowed him to cultivate his Three Dantian concurrently, enabling simultaneous Divine Refinement, Qi Refinement, and Essence Refinement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">But there was no need to reveal his full capabilities under observation. Ning Zhuo had no intention of exposing his cultivation level in the Essence Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Restraint and concealing his true abilities had always been fundamental aspects of his character.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"This is the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor," he murmured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"No, to be precise, it's just the first layer of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Zhuo examined the Bronze Sword closely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With a gentle thought, the sword flowed like liquid in his hand, transforming into a sheet of bronze armor that hovered in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The bronze armor was covered in countless markings, their intricate patterns depicting a fundamental sword technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"The Ninefold Profound Armament Armor is crafted using a unique method," Ning Zhuo recalled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"They forge Azure Flow Copper as the sole material. Then, through Divine Refinement, they imprint Martial Techniques and Martial Arts onto it. Once refined, each armor plate can transform into two forms: the plate itself and a weapon corresponding to the imprinted Martial Technique or Martial Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo gripped the sword hilt and swung it a few times, discovering that each strike was perfectly executed. Even when he deliberately deviated from the proper form, the Bronze Sword automatically corrected his movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He channeled spiritual energy into the sword and hurled it forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Bronze Sword soared into the air, hovered, and, at Ning Zhuo's command, began to swing its blade repeatedly, executing basic sword techniques and slashing through the air, just as it had when battling him moments earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This was how the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor was used.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">When restored, the fragments could be used as armor plates, providing close-fitting defense. As weapons, they could either be deployed to fight independently or wielded directly by the cultivator, allowing for precise control and perfect synchronization between man and weapon, amplifying their power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"In the second stage of the Rising Cloud Trials, you can encounter up to nine bronze artifacts, meaning nine sets of Profound Armament Armor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"According to the rules, collecting all nine sets here eliminates the need to participate in the third stage, guaranteeing first place. However, this is extremely rare. Throughout history, fewer than ten people have ever achieved this feat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"I definitely won't be able to do it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Zhuo had always been keenly aware of his limitations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"I'm weaker in this area than others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Therefore, I need to make the most of the second stage, seizing every learning opportunity to prepare for my final showdown with Ban Ji in the third stage!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"In the end, my score might still be lower than his."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"But that doesn't matter. As long as I can disrupt him and prevent him from collecting all nine sets in the third stage, I'll have achieved my goal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo knew that Ban Ji was skilled in close combat, proficient with swords and blades, and had mastered coordinated attack techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He had been meticulously gathering intelligence on Ban Ji, placing great emphasis on this aspect of his preparations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">As Ning Zhuo pondered, he continued forward, still relying on his divine sense to clear the path. The second trial, like the first, tested the depth of one's divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Soon, the second bronze artifact appeared before him - a bronze saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo drew his sword to face the saber, beginning a new round of learning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ban Ji gripped a bronze throwing knife in one hand and a bronze flail in the other, moving with urgent haste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Among all weapons, my specialties are swords and blades. My dual-wielding technique, combining sword and blade, is one of my trump cards, having defeated many formidable foes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Why haven't I encountered a single sword or blade?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"I know these artifacts appear randomly, relying solely on luck. But swords and blades are the most common weapons! Yet I've encountered two consecutive rare items - a throwing knife and a flail!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ban Ji's steps faltered as he spotted the third bronze artifact - a bronze mace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Aaaaargh! Where are the swords? Where are the blades? I need swords!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
