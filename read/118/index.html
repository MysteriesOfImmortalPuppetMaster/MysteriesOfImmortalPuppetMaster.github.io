<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 118: Saving Someone</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo's analysis led him to a critical decision: he could not afford to delay any longer.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng, with its celestial nature, was incredibly valuable.<br/>
<br/>
It had full spiritual essence, allowing it to grow and, when paired with the human life thread, to freely switch mechanical bodies.<br/>
<br/>
This meant that if Yuan Dasheng was used and cultivated properly, it could accompany Ning Zhuo throughout his entire cultivation journey.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the future, even now, Ning Zhuo heavily relied on it to challenge and compete with other contenders for the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
To put it bluntly, if it weren't for Yuan Dasheng, Ning Zhuo's traps alone would have been easily overcome by Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
While Meng Chong might not have completely broken through, his progress wouldn't have stopped at the third room.<br/>
<br/>
After pondering for a moment, Ning Zhuo recalled Yuan Dasheng's previous behavior‚Äîwhen it had lost control and stayed motionless in the wilderness outside the city. "Since Yuan Dasheng wanted to go there, that place must hold some significance for it. I'll take it there and see what happens."<br/>
<br/>
As for how to get out of the city, Ning Zhuo quickly came up with a reason.<br/>
<br/>
He summoned the Ning family guards and informed them that he had created a new mechanical monkey with Zheng Jian and wanted to test it in real combat against wild beasts outside the city to improve his mechanical skills.<br/>
<br/>
The guards hesitated, given the recent assassination attempt and the unpredictable risks of leaving the city.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn't pressure them and asked them to report to the higher-ups.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Xiaoren heard the report, he considered it and decided to send two more Foundation Establishment cultivators along with several protective items from the family treasury to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The collaboration between Ning Zhuo and Zheng Jian to create the mechanical monkey was well-known among the three families.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, Zheng Jian had praised the monkey highly and constantly lauded Ning Zhuo's mechanical skills.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren, on the one hand, was eager to see the combat capabilities of this new mechanical monkey and, on the other hand, hoped that Ning Zhuo's mechanical skills would continue to improve, as this would benefit the entire Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had anticipated Ning Xiaoren's reaction.<br/>
<br/>
The protective items provided, especially a directional teleportation talisman linked to the Ning family ancestral home, were satisfactory.<br/>
<br/>
In the event of danger, the talisman would automatically activate and teleport Ning Zhuo to safety.<br/>
<br/>
"The Ning family is indeed a powerful cultivation family. When they use their resources, their strength becomes evident," Ning Zhuo mused as he led a group of Ning family guards out of the city.<br/>
<br/>
He didn't follow Yuan Dasheng's previous route exactly but chose a longer path, eventually reaching the vicinity of the wilderness where Yuan Dasheng had stayed.<br/>
<br/>
He ordered the group to set up camp there and began controlling the Tree Martial Battle Ape, 'Dasheng,' to seek out wild beasts for practice.<br/>
<br/>
With everyone watching, Ning Zhuo couldn't let Tree Martial Battle Ape, Dasheng, act independently.<br/>
<br/>
Doing so would undoubtedly cause a sensation throughout the three families‚Äîno, the entire city!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's fingertips each linked to a thread of mana, forming ten threads that connected to Tree Martial Battle Ape, Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
The threads extended three to four meters, some curved and some straight, creating a bridge of communication between Ning Zhuo and Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
At first, when Yuan Dasheng fought against the wild beasts, it was clumsy and chaotic.<br/>
<br/>
This was because Ning Zhuo was controlling it.<br/>
<br/>
Despite his deep knowledge of mechanical arts, Tree Martial Battle Ape, Dasheng, was a new creation that required getting used to.<br/>
<br/>
Once familiar, Yuan Dasheng's combat became orderly and efficient.<br/>
<br/>
The guards were also keenly observing Dasheng's performance, discussing it fervently through whispered communications.<br/>
<br/>
"This mechanical monkey is really strong."<br/>
<br/>
"It definitely has the combat power of the Foundation Establishment stage!"<br/>
<br/>
"I don't know much about mechanical arts, but I do know some about crafting. The materials used to forge this mechanical monkey are of high quality. The basic materials are at the Foundation Establishment level, and some are even at the Golden Core level."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the timing was right, Ning Zhuo used the Mirror Platform Spirit Connection Technique to communicate, allowing Yuan Dasheng to act freely.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng had been impatient for a while, constrained by Ning Zhuo's strict commands.<br/>
<br/>
Many opportunities were missed due to Ning Zhuo's control, which frustrated Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as Ning Zhuo let it act freely, it roared towards the sky, startling both the guards and the wild beast before it.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng leaped over three meters, rushing to the beast.<br/>
<br/>
It sidestepped, raised its hips, and struck with its elbow.<br/>
<br/>
Bang.<br/>
<br/>
The wild beast was sent flying, crashing through several large trees.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family guards were stunned.<br/>
<br/>
They felt that in that instant, Tree Martial Battle Ape, Dasheng, had come to life.<br/>
<br/>
The wild beast, enraged, got up and charged again.<br/>
<br/>
"Take it easy, hold back your strength."<br/>
<br/>
"Play with it a bit, no need to kill it quickly," Ning Zhuo quickly communicated to Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng, still obedient, complied immediately.<br/>
<br/>
The guards then witnessed a spectacular display of a mechanical monkey toying with a wild beast.<br/>
<br/>
They watched in amazement, their jaws dropping.<br/>
<br/>
"This mechanical monkey is so agile, it's terrifying. It's even stronger than me!"<br/>
<br/>
"Not just you, even if we teamed up, we probably couldn't handle it."<br/>
<br/>
"Is the mechanical monkey truly strong? It's Ning Zhuo who's remarkable!"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, yes, yes!"<br/>
<br/>
The guards' whispered discussions took a turn as they looked at Ning Zhuo with newfound respect.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, their duty to protect Ning Zhuo stemmed from Ning Xiaoren's orders, knowing that Ning Zhuo was crucial to Ning family's plan to seize Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
But now, they genuinely respected Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The way Ning Zhuo controlled Tree Martial Battle Ape, Dasheng, showcasing power beyond their imagination, surpassing the combined strength of three or four of them, left them in awe.<br/>
<br/>
The guards secretly marveled, "This mechanical monkey seems alive. Ning Zhuo's control skills are unbelievably strong."<br/>
<br/>
"He‚Äôs merely at the early stage of Qi Refinement, yet with a well-crafted mechanical monkey, he possesses power exceeding ours!"<br/>
<br/>
"This is the hallmark of mechanical cultivators, beast tamers, corpse controllers, and similar cultivators. It‚Äôs not that surprising. History has seen far more exaggerated cases."<br/>
<br/>
Tree Martial Battle Ape, Dasheng, toyed with the wild boar beast to the point of its breakdown.<br/>
<br/>
Exhausted and covered in wounds, the beast eventually lay still, surrendering to its fate.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed but chose not to kill it, sparing its life.<br/>
<br/>
He recalled Tree Martial Battle Ape, Dasheng, removed the mana threads, and took out a dozen mechanical needles of varying thicknesses.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo instructed the guards, "Next, I‚Äôll test another control method to verify Tree Martial Battle Ape, Dasheng's endurance and limit. If anything unexpected happens, please ensure the safe return of this mechanical monkey."<br/>
<br/>
The head guard nodded, reassuring Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
His attitude was much more proactive than before, and any trace of arrogance due to his superior cultivation had vanished.<br/>
<br/>
Only then did Ning Zhuo send Dasheng towards the desolate area.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical needles embedded in Dasheng's body slowly rotated over time.<br/>
<br/>
Upon reaching the destination, Ning Zhuo felt a clearer connection with Dasheng, as if layers of parchment paper had been peeled away.<br/>
<br/>
When Dasheng returned, Ning Zhuo inspected the needles, removing some for examination and tightening others, infusing them with divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
Each trip Dasheng made to the desolate area slightly improved Ning Zhuo‚Äôs control over it.<br/>
<br/>
After several trips, Ning Zhuo frowned, realizing it wasn‚Äôt enough.<br/>
<br/>
The connection improved marginally each time, but the results diminished.<br/>
<br/>
While his theory of aligning with the spirit's will proved correct, the effectiveness was limited.<br/>
<br/>
It was like a bottle of water only yielding a few sips, far from quenching his thirst.<br/>
<br/>
"What should I do?"<br/>
<br/>
Just as Ning Zhuo pondered this, cries for help and sounds of battle erupted from the forest.<br/>
<br/>
The guards, on high alert, gathered around Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Something‚Äôs off!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, we should leave immediately!"<br/>
<br/>
"This might be another assassination attempt. Let‚Äôs prevent anyone from approaching."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, showed an ancient and serene expression, standing still without moving and slightly shaking his head, "This is indeed an assassination, but it's not targeting me." Through Dasheng's perspective, Ning Zhuo saw Yuan Er.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er was being chased by several cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
He looked panicked, with multiple wounds on his body, fleeing desperately with blood trailing behind him.<br/>
<br/>
Dasheng, upon spotting Yuan Er, experienced a surge of intense emotions, almost overwhelming its spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Sensing this, Ning Zhuo decisively ordered, "Dasheng, go save him!" <br/>
<br/>
The moment the order was given, the connection between Ning Zhuo and Dasheng cleared significantly.<br/>
<br/>
Dasheng let out a roar, leaping high over Yuan Er's head and landing amidst the attackers.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Er looked up and saw Tree Martial Battle Ape, Dasheng, and couldn't help but exclaim in shock, "Uncle Dasheng!?"<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, in Lava Immortal City, at the black market, Sun Lingtong, leading a group of burly men, surrounded a stall.<br/>
<br/>
He toyed with a dagger, speaking in a childish yet demanding tone, "Hey, if you‚Äôre operating here, you need to pay a protection fee! How many days has it been since you paid?"<br/>
<br/>
The stall owner knelt on the ground, crying bitterly, "Boss Sun, my mother is seriously ill, and my income from the stall is meager. Can the protection fee be postponed...?" <br/>
<br/>
"Nonsense! Do you think I'm a three-year-old to be fooled?" Sun Lingtong kicked the stall owner down, his tone disdainful and his expression fierce, "I know you well enough!"<br/>
<br/>
Just as he was about to continue speaking, he suddenly felt a chill, jumping aside abruptly.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji slowly revealed himself, "You're quite something, Sun Lingtong. I got close, and you noticed. Those spiritual eyes of yours...not bad."<br/>
<br/>
"Sir Zhu!" Sun Lingtong quickly bowed in greeting.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji showed a list, "I'm here for a simple reason, tell me where the captive is."</div>
