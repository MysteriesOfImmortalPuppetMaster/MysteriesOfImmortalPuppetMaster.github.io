<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 457: The Perching Branch Bird (Two-in-One)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The envoy arrived at the military camp of the Three Generals Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The incense table had already been set up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei knelt on the ground. Since Ning Zhuo was a foreigner, he only needed to stand and bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The envoy took out the royal decree, unfurled it, and read it aloud—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“By the order of Heaven, Our Sovereign decrees:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The three generals Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei are exceptionally brave and loyal in defending our country. In the recent ambush battle, you fought with your full strength, repelling the enemy’s offensive, and even captured alive the Nascent Soul cultivator Ma Feitui. You have eliminated a great hidden danger for our Two Note Country, achieving a glorious military feat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">When facing peril, you showed no fear, risking your lives without hesitation. You are truly the pillars of the nation. Therefore, it is hereby commanded that the official titles of the three of you be promoted from ‘Guerilla General’ to ‘Capturing General’ as a form of commendation, and you are each rewarded with ten units of national power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">As for the military strategist Ning Zhuo, though he is from another nation, his heart is set on the righteous path. He fought valiantly in battle, showing no fear of hardship. Before the battle, he presented our army with a prophetic poem, its words precise and predictive of the course of events. In the ambush, he assisted the troops repeatedly, performing meritorious deeds and slaying countless enemies. Such ambition and resolve must be rewarded. He is hereby granted four units of national power as encouragement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">May you remember this honor, live up to expectations, and continue fighting courageously to defend the might of our Two Note Country.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Thus decreed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The three generals cried out in unison, “We humbly thank the sovereign for the grace!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo also joined in, echoing their gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“The envoy must be weary from traveling all the way from the royal capital. Please, come this way.” After accepting the decree, Liu Er’s face brimmed with smiles as he hosted the envoy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">When the banquet was nearing its end, Ning Zhuo approached the envoy and discreetly gave him a large number of spirit stones: “The camp is simple, and the hospitality insufficient. I beg the envoy’s pardon.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The envoy smiled and skillfully received the storage pouch of spirit stones. Not long after, with the three generals and Ning Zhuo seeing him off, he left the Three Generals Camp and returned to the royal capital to report back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Late at night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Cultivators formed cultivation-based nations, and the upper echelons of these states would condense national power into national power bricks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Inside his tent, Ning Zhuo carefully examined a national power brick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Two Note Country was founded on the principle of the Water Virtue, and so the national power bricks were black in color.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Under the lamplight in the tent, the surface of the national power brick revealed faint ripples, like dark currents of the deep sea. This was the sign of the Water Virtue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo stroked the brick’s surface with his palm. It felt icy cold, but not piercing like a block of ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">This was the first time Ning Zhuo had ever handled a national power brick. Previously, he had only read about them many times in books.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo channeled his divine sense and infused it into the national power brick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The brick responded with a wave of energy that covered Ning Zhuo’s entire body, and at once it sensed the strategist’s seal in his possession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">It was as if a lock had found its key. The great gate slowly opened, and a thread of national power flowed outward from the brick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Zhuo guided this national power with his divine sense, first sending it into the upper dantian of his Sea of Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Mirror Platform Spiritual Communication Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">With Ning Zhuo’s active cultivation, inside his upper dantian, the national power transformed into a magnificent radiance, illuminating all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Under this radiant light, countless mirror-thoughts emerged, their efficiency incomparably high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo then channeled this strand of national power into his middle dantian, the Qi Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Five-Element Qi Principle Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">As soon as the national power was infused, it almost instantly transformed into a large surge of magical Qi cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Blood-Muscle Stained by Demonic Dye Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Similarly, when it reached the lower dantian, the national power transformed into blood-muscle, thickening the blood-muscle ground by three full feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Marvelous, truly marvelous.” Ning Zhuo immediately felt all three of his dantians swell, his entire body filled with a powerful force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This power was gentle and profound, possessing immense inclusivity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo stopped after a shallow taste and slowly opened his eyes, his face brimming with delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">In just those short moments, his cultivation had abruptly risen a small fraction, equivalent to what he would normally gain from a full month of rest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Relying on national power for cultivation is akin to direct empowerment, saving me the need for hard, prolonged practice!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“More importantly, national power bears no fixed elemental attribute and can be converted into the magical power of any technique under the heavens.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“No wonder in ancient times, so many cultivators risked their lives to support a Dragon Court.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Based on the ambush battle’s achievements, Ning Zhuo did not gain as much as the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Even though his prophetic poem was accurate, it only had a positive effect on the Three Generals Camp and the Red Flower Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo’s contribution largely benefited from the three generals’ capturing of Ma Feitui. Without that feat, Ning Zhuo would not have reaped so much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Furthermore, when Liu Er reported the achievements, he deliberately emphasized Ning Zhuo’s contributions, boosting his gains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">When faced with these battle merits, Ning Zhuo did not hesitate and chose to receive national power bricks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“If this were before the ambush, I might have hesitated. But after personally experiencing the battlefield, for a long time to come, national power bricks will be my best, foremost, and even only choice!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The ambush deeply affected Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">In one moment, though he was within the army formation, facing Ma Feitui’s returning spear, he nearly suffered defeat and death!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">At the moment his life was to be decided, Ning Zhuo scarcely had time to react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Later, by using directional void movement, he met up with Sun Lingtong and fully exerted himself to seize the spoils of war, leaving no time for retrospection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Not until the entire army had set off again, journeying back to Green Forest Immortal City, did Ning Zhuo gradually come to realize how frightening it had been.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“Cultivation!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“Cultivation is the greatest foundation of all!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Although my Five Elements realm is profound, without cultivation to support it, it is like casting pearls before swine.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Foundation Establishment…too weak!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Golden Core…still weak!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Nascent Soul…still weak!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">This battle greatly broadened Ning Zhuo’s horizons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">So this was the benefit of traveling a thousand miles and roaming the four directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo had, of course, learned early on about Golden Core and Nascent Soul levels. He’d read about them countless times in various texts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Yet many realizations in life must be personally experienced to truly grasp their weight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, even surrounded by countless comrades, he could still be instantly killed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Paper knowledge always felt shallow; one must experience it personally to truly understand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Those Golden Core-level cultivators from Thousand Peaks Forest were repeatedly slain by Liu, Guan, and Zhang as if slaughtering pigs and dogs!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Even Lord Long, mighty as he was at Nascent Soul level, nearly got burned to death in the end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">All these were facts that Ning Zhuo witnessed with his own eyes, and these facts thoroughly ignited the fire in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Foundation Establishment…not enough!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Golden Core…not enough!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Nascent Soul…still not enough!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“I must climb upwards, continuing to climb, amassing cultivation at full speed and with all my strength.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“I must become a powerful cultivator. I must hold my own fate in my own hands!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">At the moment he could have been killed, Ning Zhuo did not even have the ability to react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He refused to endure that sorrow ever again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong, with such talent and comprehension, was still only at the Foundation Establishment stage even now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Yet to accumulate cultivation is easier said than done?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">It wasn’t for lack of effort —this was simply normal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">For a Foundation Establishment cultivator, several decades of cultivation was considered brief. Typically, it took around a hundred years. Many cultivators reached the end of their lifespans without ever breaking through their bottlenecks to Golden Core, eventually dying of old age.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">For Sun Lingtong’s speed, he was already quite fast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo was only sixteen years old and had reached the early Foundation Establishment stage. He simultaneously cultivated three major techniques, each one top-tier in the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Training in just one would require far more spirit energy accumulation, more time, and more effort than a normal cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">For Ning Zhuo, who cultivated three simultaneously, the time cost would be tripled!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Sun Lingtong had once advised him not to be impatient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Nothing in the world is purely advantageous, nor entirely disadvantageous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Slower cultivation, taking too long, and requiring too much investment —these were the huge costs of practicing top-tier techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo did not want to proceed step by step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">He was currently traveling the world to cure his mother, venturing north and south, taking on great risks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He had a strong need for higher cultivation, longing to become a top-tier cultivator in the next moment if possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Hence, he had always been actively seeking methods to accelerate his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Fortunately, this was a brilliant and prosperous cultivation era!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">This world indeed had many shortcuts for accumulating cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The most common methods included adopting higher-quality techniques, using spirit stones, pills, magic treasures, dual cultivation, direct empowerment, or even devouring and converting others’ magical power, etc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">National power was similar to direct empowerment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Using national power, one could rapidly increase their cultivation in an extremely short amount of time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">This was unlike using spirit stones or pills to increase one’s cultivation efficiency; it directly elevated one’s realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The latter was like making a tree grow faster than before, while the former was like directly grafting another piece of trunk onto one’s own tree.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“I have four national power bricks in hand. To what realm can they push my cultivation?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo’s mind was awash with thoughts, yet he stopped extracting national power and returned to conventional methods to cultivate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">At once, he felt a tremendous sense of disappointment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“So slow, normal cultivation is truly too slow!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“In my current state, this kind of cultivation speed is utterly unbearable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Shuang Jing had once more restored his demeanor as a high-born disciple, dressed in a green robe, elegant and poised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Shuang Jing invited Ning Zhuo to a banquet in Green Forest Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo arrived on time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He cupped his hands in greeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Shuang Jing remained seated and did not rise. Instead, he gestured for Ning Zhuo to sit opposite him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“This place, the Little Bird Tower, is the most renowned restaurant in all of Green Forest Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Their specialty is the Ten-Bird-One-Heart Feast, with countless variations.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“I have booked the top floor and instructed the kitchen to prepare this Ten-Bird-One-Heart Feast. Military Strategist Ning, please do taste it thoroughly.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Shuang Jing smiled as he introduced this to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo responded politely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The first dish served was called Silver-Wave Aura Soup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The soup was semi-transparent, faintly shimmering with silver light. Its fragrance was fresh, and it contained bird meat of a pale white color as the main ingredient, along with ginkgo, white fungus, pear, goji berries, fish maw, and other supplements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo first took a spoonful and sipped a bit. The soup was light and gentle, with a natural fruity aroma and medicinal essence, cool and slightly sweet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">He tasted a piece of bird meat. It melted upon entering his mouth, offering a unique texture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Reflected in Shuang Jing’s pupils was Ning Zhuo savoring the delicacy. He carefully observed every gesture of Ning Zhuo’s, thinking: “The Ning family is indeed a prominent clan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The Ning family had once produced a Nascent Soul-level cultivator. After migrating from the North Wind Country to the South Bean Country, the family still had a solid foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">In the eyes of a true high-born disciple, one could discern this foundation from the smallest details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Although Ning Zhuo had lacked parental guidance from a young age, his uncle and aunt had taught him life’s etiquette. In the academy, elders had instructed the students in everyday manners, covering all aspects of daily life —standing, sitting, sleeping, and so forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Moreover, after growing up, Ning Zhuo had read numerous books and trained himself in such conduct, all to interact with noble cultivators and gain their favor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Shuang Jing saw that Ning Zhuo’s manner of eating was succinct and graceful, seemingly slow but actually swift. Feeling quite comfortable and encouraged, he, too, gained some appetite and began to taste his portion of the Aura Soup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo drank about half the Aura Soup and then stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Shuang Jing asked, “Military Strategist Ning, do you know what the main ingredient of this dish is?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Zhuo replied, “It should be the Perching Branch Bird.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Shuang Jing continued, “There are many varieties of Perching Branch Birds. Which one is this, exactly?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo answered, “I see that the soup glimmers with silver light and has a ginkgo taste. It is most likely the Silver-Feather Perching Branch Bird.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Shuang Jing smiled, “Military Strategist Ning is indeed resourceful and wise. A correct guess.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">With that, he said no more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo was slightly puzzled. When Shuang Jing invited him before, he had been friendly and warm. It was clear he wanted to draw closer. Yet after meeting at the banquet, Shuang Jing began to put on airs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">It seemed that now there was no external threat, and dressed in his luxurious attire, Shuang Jing had reverted to the role of a high-born noble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The bird’s surface had been coated in honey and garnished with cherries and cherry blossoms, exuding a sense of romance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The second dish was soon served.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">This was a roasted dish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">A fresh flower bloomed on the platter, and inside the flower rested a roasted bird.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">After examining it carefully, Ning Zhuo confirmed it was not chicken, but indeed bird.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">After tasting a piece of the bird’s flesh with his chopsticks, Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">The bird’s meat was fragrant, sweet, and crisp, evoking the feeling of a spring breeze brushing one’s face, cherry blossoms in full bloom, drifting down like rain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Shuang Jing waited until Ning Zhuo put down his chopsticks before asking about the main ingredient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Ning Zhuo replied, “This must also be a Perching Branch Bird, and likely the Cherry-Blossom Perching Branch Bird.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Shuang Jing nodded, smiling without a word.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Ning Zhuo felt a subtle understanding of Shuang Jing’s intentions but did not expose it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">When the third dish arrived, it resembled an herbal chicken dish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Ning Zhuo activated his magic, cutting open the chicken’s abdomen. At once, purple rice and purple sweet potato spilled out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">After tasting it, Ning Zhuo involuntarily nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The sweetness of the purple rice blended with the delicate smoothness of the purple sweet potato, paired with tender chicken meat. The flavor was profound, bringing calmness to his mind and clearing his upper dantian, leaving it tranquil and bright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">This time, without waiting for Shuang Jing to ask, Ning Zhuo took the initiative, “This must be the Purple-Wisdom Perching Branch Bird.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Shuang Jing saw Ning Zhuo smiling with a meaningful look and knew the moment was ripe. He finally revealed his carefully prepared speech.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">“Perching Branch Birds have long, thin beaks. They insert their beaks into tree trunks to absorb sap for sustenance.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">“When they wish to reproduce, they insert their beaks into the deepest part of the trunk and inject their life essence into the wood.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">“The same Perching Branch Bird, depending on which tree it chooses, will have different offspring.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">“From the ginkgo tree comes the Silver-Feather Perching Branch Bird, which shines with silver wings, swift and clear-voiced.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">“From the cherry blossom tree comes the Cherry-Blossom Perching Branch Bird, pale pink, light-bodied, with gentle, slightly sorrowful song.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">“From the rosewood tree comes the Purple-Wisdom Perching Branch Bird, with deep purple feathers, capable of understanding human speech, the most intelligent of them all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">At this point, Shuang Jing paused, “From this, we can see that the environment in which one grows is of utmost importance to a bird, to a person!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">“Military Strategist Ning, you are a brilliant and outstanding young talent from a great clan. To be frank, I do not quite understand why you joined the Three Generals Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">“You are like a fine talent or a beautiful jade, and what is the Three Generals Camp? It is like a twisted, nameless tree.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">Ning Zhuo smiled and shook his head, “Is Lord Shuang suggesting I leave the Three Generals Camp and join the White Jade Camp?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">Ning Zhuo had discussed Shuang Jing’s recruitment intentions with Sun Lingtong before arriving, so he had anticipated the offer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">But Shuang Jing shook his head, “My White Jade Camp has been beaten down and is in ruins, needing to rebuild from scratch. This time, there will no longer be such strong support as before.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">“Using such a weakened army to invite you, Military Strategist Ning, would hardly show my sincerity, no?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Outside the window.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">The sky was bright and clear, the sun giving off a warm radiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">A flock of Ginkgo Perching Branch Birds descended from the blue sky, their wings tracing silvery lines in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">They dove downward at high speed, almost suicidally “crashing” into the dense foliage of a large tree’s canopy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">The flock chirped noisily, wings flapping, wind swirling, leaves rustling. Their combined sounds wove into a resounding cacophony, surpassing the conversation inside the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">After Shuang Jing spoke a certain statement, he looked toward Ning Zhuo, his eyes filled with intense anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">Ning Zhuo blinked, a hint of astonishment forming in his brow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">He glanced outside at the rowdy flock of Ginkgo Perching Branch Birds. In that brief moment, countless thoughts raced through his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">When he turned back to face Shuang Jing, his expression had already regained its calm, “A retainer?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">Shuang Jing nodded, “Become my family’s retainer. That is my sincerity!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">“You should know the weight carried by my surname, correct?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="345">Ning Zhuo nodded as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="347">Of course he knew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="349">The surname Shuang was the royal surname of Two Note Country!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="351">Shuang Jing took out a jade slip and slowly handed it to Ning Zhuo, “Here is the remuneration for becoming a retainer.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="353">“I know you exchanged your battle merits for four national power bricks.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="355">“If you become my retainer, that identity would far surpass your current role as a strategist and "festival wine official" by countless levels!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="357">“When drawing upon national power, you would enjoy nearly triple the enhancement.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="359">“Just from this one point, it would be as if tripling the value of your battle merits. The significance of this is enormous, is it not?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="361">Ning Zhuo’s face grew solemn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="363">He infused his divine sense into the jade slip, and his heart stirred with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="365">The conditions Shuang Jing proposed were exceedingly generous, and he did not restrict Ning Zhuo’s freedom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="367">If Ning Zhuo ever wanted to leave and cease serving as a retainer, he could shed this identity at any time!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="369">So, should he become a retainer of one of the Two Note Country’s highest elites?</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
