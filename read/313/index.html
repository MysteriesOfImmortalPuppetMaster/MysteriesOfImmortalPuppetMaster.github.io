<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Yang Chanyu said, "You were also eliminated, weren't you?" Sun Lingtong asked, "How are you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Still alive. I didn't expect Zhu Xuanji to be so formidable! In the recent battle, he didn't even exert his full strength," Yang Chanyu replied, still shaken at the mention of Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Such a powerful figure is among the top tier of Golden Core cultivators in the world. Among the many Golden Core true disciples of the great sects, most would meet their end at his hands if they truly fought," Sun Lingtong nodded, his face pale. He walked to the window and was astonished to see the many scarlet flame beasts on the street, "I didn't expect the situation outside to deteriorate so rapidly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Yang Chanyu said, "If this Lava Immortal Palace fails, it will completely collapse, and no one will gain anything." "By then, even escaping will be a problem for us!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">All along, Sun Yang and the others had managed to evade Zhu Xuanji and others by leveraging the geographical advantage of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">If the Immortal Palace were to disappear, they would be exposed in the volcanic lava, vulnerable to the Nascent Soul-level Meng Kui and the Golden Core-level Zhu Xuanji, with a grim fate awaiting them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Yang Chanyu, panting heavily, stared at Sun Lingtong, "I'm really worried that after all this effort, it will all be for nothing. Should we retreat first?" Sun Lingtong shook his head, "Ning Zhuo is still in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Do you have that much faith in him?" Yang Chanyu raised an eyebrow, "I don't believe a mere Qi Refining cultivator has any trump card that could turn the tables against Zhu Xuanji. Continuing to gamble is unwise!" "Sun Lingtong, we should leave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Sun Lingtong used his hand as a pillow, "Hehe, I trust little Zhuo. Haven't you noticed? He hasn't been eliminated yet." Yang Chanyu showed a hint of surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. I wouldn't bet my life on a losing gamble," Sun Lingtong said confidently on the surface, but he was deeply worried inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"little Zhuo, from now on, it's all up to you!" Sun Lingtong sighed deeply in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Within the Curved Light Weaving Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Official Techniques Lock on Rudie Niang had been broken by her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Once the mechanical little maiden regained her freedom, she lay on the surface of an ice block, anxiously watching the young cultivator inside the ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The young cultivator was Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">At this moment, his eyes were tightly shut, and he had lost consciousness, falling into a coma state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Previously, although Ning Zhuo had hidden within the Curved Light Weaving Formation, he was still pierced by the golden light that followed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Despite the warnings from the mechanical ring, which helped him avoid many fatal attacks, he still fell into a coma due to the severe injuries he sustained in a short period.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">However, just before losing consciousness, Ning Zhuo managed to release a pair of mechanical constructs from his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ice Jade Hands!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Ice Jade Hands contained the spirit of Ning Xiaohui, and through items obtained from Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, Ning Zhuo had pushed its spirit to its full potential.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The Ice Jade Hands performed the Icy Jade Palm technique on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo was frozen within a massive ice block for emergency healing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">What reassured the mechanical little maiden was that Ning Zhuo's aura was becoming increasingly stable and powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Ice Jade Hands hovered in mid-air, with its palm pressed against the top of the ice block, continuously maintaining the Icy Jade Palm technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Suddenly, Ning Zhuo's eyelids twitched slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He regained consciousness, realizing he had just fallen into a coma and was now inside an ice block, being treated by the Ice Jade Hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"The injuries are severe!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Until now, I've never suffered such serious injuries."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"However, it was precisely because I fell into a temporary coma that I was judged to have lost the battle, thus deceiving Zhu Xuanji and allowing my feigned death plan to succeed." Ning Zhuo's divine sense spread continuously, penetrating the ice block, "seeing" Rudie Niang, the Ice Jade Hands, and the still-maintained Curved Light Weaving Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">In the imperial examination, Ning Zhuo's name was "Entry Standard," while Sun Lingtong used the name "Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Sun Lingtong voluntarily conceded, was eliminated, and the name "Ning Zhuo" disappeared from the examination list, but "Entry Standard" remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Supreme Virtuous Water..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">At the critical moment, Ning Zhuo used the last two drops of Supreme Virtuous Water to remove the monitoring methods on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This was also one of the key actions that ultimately misled Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Truly a treasure of the water element's merit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Even though Ning Zhuo was in a coma state at the time, he could still feel the supreme gentleness and kindness of water. Water has no constant form, yet it embraces all things. As Ning Zhuo was cleansed, his heart was as calm as a mirror, serene like a still lake, as if he were floating in a stream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"I was in a coma state, with no combat power. The Lava Immortal Palace didn't judge me as eliminated. Is it because I released the Ice Jade Hands and had Rudie Niang, who believed I could recover?" "Or is it that the restrictions of the Lava Immortal Palace have weakened to the point where it can no longer transport cultivators?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The destruction of the restrictions wasn't a clear-cut process, with distinct stages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Since the restrictions of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities were damaged, they hadn't been repaired and continued to deteriorate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">However, it wasn't as drastic as the precipitous decline when the Immortal Palace was heavily damaged before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">It was precisely because of this concern that Ning Zhuo had to fight Zhu Xuanji earlier—he was very worried that Sun Lingtong might really die at Zhu Xuanji's hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Of course, at the beginning of the confrontation, Ning Zhuo also hoped for victory on his side. After all, on paper, Ning Zhuo's side had a three-to-one advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">In the end, none of them expected Zhu Xuanji to be so formidable!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"I've learned, I've learned," Ning Zhuo reflected deeply within the ice block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"This is the power of hiding one's strength!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"In a way, this defeat is because I didn't hide as deeply as Zhu Xuanji."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Mother was right, I need to hide, to be low-key."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Look at Zhu Xuanji, he's a noble, a scion of royalty, yet he can hide so well. On the surface, he's a renowned divine constable, but in reality, he has mastered divine abilities like the Golden Mountain Stance and Jade Pillar Posture!" "Compared to him, I have too little to hide, what am I compared to him?" "If it weren't for the help of the boss, I would have been eliminated this time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo felt a lingering fear, taking this battle as a lesson, and decided to emulate Zhu Xuanji in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Crack, crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The ice block was covered in cracks and then collapsed with a loud crash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo regained his freedom, half-kneeling on the ground, then slowly opened his eyes and stood up amidst the ice shards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Rudie Niang cheered joyfully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo gave her a slight smile, then looked up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He secretly activated his divine ability, and a clear thread appeared in his vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"The Supreme Virtuous Water didn't wash away the thread."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">This thread was naturally the Life Hanging by a Thread imposed by the Lava Immortal Palace on the imperial examination cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo's expression suddenly changed, and he bent over, vomiting some fresh blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The blood contained many ice shards, with blood and golden light flashing within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">This was the attack inflicted by Zhu Xuanji, eroding Ning Zhuo's body, frozen by the ice block, and finally expelled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Even now, the golden light within the ice shards remained sharp and piercing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After expelling the ice shards, Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, feeling fully recovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Rudie Niang asked if they should dismantle the Curved Light Weaving Formation, as she was gradually feeling overwhelmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo surveyed the surroundings, having made up his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He asked Rudie Niang to hold on for a little longer, then took out a mat, sat cross-legged, and began to regulate his breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Soon, his aura became extremely calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The young cultivator's eyes were slightly closed, his fair skin emitting a faint cold light amidst the interplay of light and shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"This is the perfect opportunity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo made a decision and officially began the final sprint towards the Foundation Establishment stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He took out an array disk from his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">This array disk was a Foundation Establishment-level artifact from the Zhou family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Back then, Ning Zhuo voluntarily contributed Night Wind Soft Iron, prompting Zhou Nongying to personally reward him with an array disk, which was this very item.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Zhou family's long-standing expertise in formations made this array disk superior to those available on the market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Even though Ning Zhuo could set up a spirit gathering formation himself, it couldn't compare to this meticulously crafted array disk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Immediately, he infused it with mana, causing the array disk to hover above his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The array disk began to rotate slowly, sketching out a three-dimensional formation in mid-air, with tightly coordinated formation patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo then took out spirit stones, placing them at various formation nodes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The spirit stones began to deplete, converting into spiritual energy, filling the space within the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The spiritual energy accumulated rapidly, forming a mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and began to circulate his cultivation technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Lower Dantian—Demonic Blood Vein Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">His vital energy was vigorous, his blood qi surged, and for a moment, his aura was like a rolling tide, powerful and imposing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The blood qi condensed into blood veins, appearing in large patches, quickly covering his entire body in a net-like blood armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Not only on the surface, but within his body, the blood veins also spread, protecting his internal organs and attaching to the depths of his bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo's demonic might was overwhelming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Middle Dantian—Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo slowly inhaled and exhaled, the five-colored mana in his qi sea roiling continuously, with a magnificent aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The mana gradually expanded, reflecting the surrounding five colors in a cycle, with strict order, balance, and harmony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The young cultivator exuded an aura of immortality, full of charm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Upper Dantian—Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The divine sea was vast, with divine sense condensing into mirrors, reflecting mirror light, illuminating all directions, and scanning all around.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo's face showed a compassionate expression, with profound Buddhist intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The spiritual energy, dense to the extreme, was absorbed by Ning Zhuo with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">His absorption was so fierce and swift that it formed a vortex of spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The vortex spun faster and faster, rapidly expanding, soon filling the entire space within the spirit gathering formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">And Ning Zhuo, at the center of the spiritual energy vortex, was filled with spiritual energy throughout his body, with his meridians, limbs, head, and internal organs all being stirred by the spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">A qualitative change occurred in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The lower dantian suddenly changed, with the blood qi flowing like a stream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Foundation Establishment's first barrier—the essence barrier was passed, as easy as breathing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The middle dantian then transformed, with the gaseous mana condensing and compressing into a liquid state. In the qi sea, it was as if a gentle rain was falling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Each "raindrop" was the condensation of more than five times the gaseous mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Foundation Establishment's second barrier—the qi barrier was passed, naturally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The upper dantian's mirror light expanded, illuminating the surroundings with clarity, transforming the world, with divine sense stirring, easily undergoing a qualitative change, transforming into divine consciousness!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Foundation Establishment's third barrier—the divine barrier was passed, naturally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">All three barriers were passed, and the dantians were established! Even better, the three dantians were in harmony, with the aura unified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Three Sects's Supreme Method!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Three Dantians Foundation Establishment!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Achieved at this moment!!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Dong dong dong...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Suddenly, the sound of bells echoed throughout the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"The Transmission Bell?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Why is it suddenly ringing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">All the cultivators were astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Could it be, little Zhuo?" Sun Lingtong had a feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"Three Dantians Foundation Establishment! He succeeded, he succeeded!!!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shouted in the main hall, its face filled with panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">It had thought that Ning Zhuo, severely injured, would remain weak for a long time, unable to compete for the position of the Lava Immortal Palace's master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Unexpectedly, Ning Zhuo recovered so quickly and seized this opportunity to ascend, triggering a qualitative change in his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He had become a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
