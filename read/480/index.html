<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 480: Giving the Treasure to Ning Zhuo (Two-in-One)</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo cultivated three dantians at once, which caused his cultivation time to be at least three times that of an ordinary cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
But in fact, it was far more than that.<br/>
<br/>
Because the three top-tier arts were too exceptional, each portion of cultivation time they consumed greatly exceeded that of ordinary arts.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not show any sign of smugness. “Even though I saved myself nine years of painstaking effort overnight, it really doesn’t count for much.”<br/>
<br/>
“Building Foundation Stage Six: Unhindered Opening of the Fields, Germination of Precious Medicine, Radiance of the Dantian, Symbol of Visions, Inner Illumination of Golden Light, Transition from Illusory to Real... I have only just stepped into the stage.”<br/>
<br/>
“I still had a long way to go.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered his own cultivation status.<br/>
<br/>
“I cultivated the three top methods.”<br/>
<br/>
“Among them, the Demon-Stained Blood Vessel Art could rely on extracting my clansmen’s blood, used together with the Heavy Armored Blood Ape: Great Victory to speed up cultivation. It could also use the Heaven-Born Earth-Nurtured Embryonic Breathing Grand Art and the Embryonic-Breath Spirit Boat to strengthen the body. Even though it’s another path, all roads lead to the same end.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for the Five Elements Breathing Code, I possessed a profound Five Elements realm, and improved it into the Five-Viscera Temple Spiritual Divine Art. Now I have completed the Earth-Element Spleen Temple, which greatly boosted my cultivation speed. But for the moment, I still lack Ten-Thousand-Year Fire Essence, Earth Essence, Water Essence, and Metal Essence for refining the other four viscera temples.”<br/>
<br/>
“With the Mirror Platform Spirituality Method, I haven’t found any shortcut, but in truth, my progress in that area has always been good and I haven’t encountered any bottlenecks thus far. This shows that my nature is benevolent and kind, and I am good at calmly considering problems, which aligns well with this Buddhist text.”<br/>
<br/>
“But compared to the National Power Brick, the difference is extremely obvious!”<br/>
<br/>
“For now, cultivating by relying on the National Power Brick is the proper path indeed.”<br/>
<br/>
“Using national power to raise one’s cultivation carried no risk, nor any side effects.”<br/>
<br/>
“No wonder in the cultivation world, a nation is the most outstanding form of power.”<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo used up four National Power Bricks, he deeply experienced how wonderful national power was!<br/>
<br/>
In the depths of Ning Zhuo’s gaze, a vibrant brilliance flickered.<br/>
<br/>
He traveled the world and felt the bitterness of lacking enough cultivation. Being weak in cultivation made many things too inconvenient.<br/>
<br/>
“If I could acquire more National Power Bricks, that would be ideal.”<br/>
<br/>
With that thought, he became even more eager for the upcoming great war.<br/>
<br/>
“If I earned merits in the war, I might once again obtain National Power Bricks.”<br/>
<br/>
“I could also rely on the army of the Two Zhu Kingdom, seizing the opportunity to seek my mother’s relics.”<br/>
<br/>
It could be said that he could cultivate and rescue his mother at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
So, he certainly couldn’t let go of the Stone-Cloistered Old Monster’s storyline.<br/>
<br/>
The previous ambush had completely proven the tremendous advantage of that identity.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Ning Zhuo had been the military advisor and wine-offering officer of the Three General Camp; now he was Mulan’s husband, making many things more inconvenient. But once he formed the Stone-Cloistered Old Monster to handle certain troublesome matters, he could tackle them from another angle!<br/>
<br/>
“Perhaps I could use the Stone-Cloistered Old Monster identity to secure my mother’s gift from the Six Caves Sect in advance. It’s possible.”<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Ning Zhuo also knew that he had to be extremely cautious about this move.<br/>
<br/>
This Stone-Cloistered Old Monster identity had no connection with the Ning family, so creating any sudden link would raise all sorts of suspicions.<br/>
<br/>
Especially the Great Cave Master of the Six Caves Sect, Lu Hongtu, who was highly strategic, viciously perceptive, and quite familiar with the Stone-Cloistered Old Monster. If Ning Zhuo acted too hastily, it could very likely provoke his suspicion and investigation.<br/>
<br/>
Who knew, maybe one day when he acted as the Stone-Cloistered Old Monster, he would be ambushed by Lu Hongtu’s schemes.<br/>
<br/>
Having reached the Germination of Precious Medicine stage, Ning Zhuo needed to continually maneuver his essence, energy, and spirit so that the three merged into the Precious Medicine.<br/>
<br/>
This was the main focus of cultivation at this stage!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo possessed an exceedingly strong advantage in this area—cultivating three dantians simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
This allowed each of his dantians to receive its own training, giving him a robust foundation. As a result, he could easily draw on the cultivation of the other two dantians and fuse them together.<br/>
<br/>
If one focused on only a single dantian, the other two would be extremely shallow, making it not only hard to draw on their cultivation, but even if one did, it would be quite limited. That would make the fused Precious Medicine even more meager.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stopped cultivating, rose slowly, put away his meditation mat and cloud mist, lifted the curtain, and stepped out of the tent.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, the sky was clear for miles with no trace of a cloud.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes slightly, then slowly opened them.<br/>
<br/>
A gentle breeze brushed his face as he lifted his gaze to the sky.<br/>
<br/>
In just one night, his cultivation had broken through the Unhindered Opening of the Fields, sparing him nine years of hardship, and advanced to the Germination of Precious Medicine stage.<br/>
<br/>
Yet such a massive breakthrough instead made him feel insignificant.<br/>
<br/>
The firmament was vast, the earth was desolate, and he felt like a speck of dust within it.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood in the Three General Camp, and the sounds of training rang in his ears—Guan Hong’s cold shouts now and then, and Zhang Hei’s angry scolding.<br/>
<br/>
Being at the Germination of Precious Medicine stage at sixteen was already quite rare, and Ning Zhuo was even cultivating three dantians simultaneously!<br/>
<br/>
But compared to Liu, Guan, and Zhang—who were all at the Golden Core level—no matter how rare he was, he was still merely in the early Building Foundation stage.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone believed that given time, he would surely achieve greatness.<br/>
<br/>
But reality’s cruelty and contradictions lay in how it would not treat you gently just because your future looked bright.<br/>
<br/>
It was not that Heaven and Earth revolved for him, but rather that he needed to shift with the wind.<br/>
<br/>
The world had never adapted to individuals; individuals had to take the initiative and adapt to this harsh external world.<br/>
<br/>
At present, Ning Zhuo had to adapt, bearing the fact that his cultivation was weak yet he needed to travel the world, facing a cultivation realm teeming with Golden Core and Nascent Soul practitioners.<br/>
<br/>
“Fortunately, with the hundreds of cultivation arts having developed to this day, there were countless methods for fighting beyond one’s realm!”<br/>
<br/>
Cultivation involved the pursuit, development, utilization, and innovation of the principles of Heaven and Earth.<br/>
<br/>
The process of cultivation was the continual excavation and transformation of a cultivator’s essence, energy, and spirit. Throughout that process, the cultivator’s power gradually climbed and underwent qualitative change. For instance, initially there was only true qi, then it transformed into fluid, eventually solidifying into a Golden Core!<br/>
<br/>
In the early days of the cultivation world, cultivators focused on exploring themselves, constantly probing the limits of every stage of cultivation, causing each advancement in realm to produce a qualitative leap in power.<br/>
<br/>
As development continued and the potential space to excavate within oneself shrank closer to zero, cultivators had no choice but to turn their attention outward, creating the explosive progress of the hundreds of cultivation arts and culminating in the unprecedented prosperity seen today.<br/>
<br/>
Spirit pills, magic tools, formations, talismans...<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators had ever more ways and methods to utilize resources.<br/>
<br/>
National power was a type of artificial resource refined from the strength of a nation through a new cultivation method.<br/>
<br/>
National power was hard to find!<br/>
<br/>
In truth, it was rare to have an opportunity where a nation would distribute National Power Bricks.<br/>
<br/>
The Two Zhu Kingdom, from top to bottom, was a strong country in a region plagued by constant conflict, forcing many armies to be stationed in place, unable to move.<br/>
<br/>
Under such circumstances, only by conscripting additional troops and forming a new army could they muster the strength to subjugate the Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
And to attract more cultivators to serve, offering National Power Bricks as a reward was an extremely enticing advertising tactic.<br/>
<br/>
“My cultivation needs National Power Bricks to grow by leaps and bounds. Until then, I can only rely on the hundreds of cultivation arts to reduce or even overcome the combat power gap!”<br/>
<br/>
“Among the hundreds of cultivation arts, only the Mechanism Arts disregard all priorities, merging every art into one for a grand achievement.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had long been clear about the path ahead of him.<br/>
<br/>
He left behind a Flying Message as a report and then departed the camp.<br/>
<br/>
Next, he intended to repair the Ten-Thousand-Mile Soaring Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since Ning Zhuo suspected that Liu Er had hidden some sort of detection method in the Three General Camp, he had grown ever more cautious.<br/>
<br/>
Repairing something as significant as the Ten-Thousand-Mile Soaring Dragon naturally couldn’t be done carelessly and required great caution.<br/>
<br/>
Although Liu Er was drilling troops, he was always employing his innate Spirit Sound Pulse Search to scout the entire camp, with particular attention paid to Ning Zhuo’s tent.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo stepped out of his tent, Liu Er was already secretly observing.<br/>
<br/>
He did not need Ning Zhuo’s Flying Message to arrive in his hands; he had long known that Ning Zhuo had left the camp.<br/>
<br/>
“Second Brother, Third Brother, continue the training. I have other matters to handle,” Liu Er said, then finished the drill.<br/>
<br/>
On the way, he received Ning Zhuo’s Flying Message. A sweep with his divine sense revealed nothing noteworthy—just a simple notice.<br/>
<br/>
“The strategist is treating me in such a casual manner, not like before.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er felt slighted and grew angry once again.<br/>
<br/>
But a moment later, he suppressed this vexation, realizing he ought to be more magnanimous.<br/>
<br/>
“The strategist has contributed much to the Three General Camp. Even if his attitude were worse, I should endure it.”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er comforted himself.<br/>
<br/>
“What exactly is the strategist planning to do?”<br/>
<br/>
“Could he be sneaking off to the Red Flower Camp?”<br/>
<br/>
“As the strategist and wine-offering officer, he should logically have reported to me before leaving the camp.”<br/>
<br/>
“Wait, could it be that he really is heading to the Red Flower Camp and just didn’t want to inform me?”<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he thought about Mulan secretly meeting Ning Zhuo, Liu Er became increasingly irritable and resentful.<br/>
<br/>
Even Liu Er himself found it baffling that he felt such intense emotions.<br/>
<br/>
He employed his techniques, concealed himself, and left the camp, secretly tailing Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not head toward the Red Flower Camp; instead, he slipped into the forested mountains.<br/>
<br/>
“Is he planning to take a detour to the Red Flower Camp?”<br/>
<br/>
“How strange!”<br/>
<br/>
“Liu Er, Liu Er, you should be more magnanimous. Why do you care so much about the Red Flower Camp?”<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s innate Spirit Sound Pulse Search had an extremely broad range, so even from a distance, he never lost track.<br/>
<br/>
Even Sun Lingtong, who was operating the Ten-Thousand-Mile Soaring Dragon to scout the surroundings, did not detect any sign of Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
Deep in the mountain forest, an elderly demon cultivator saw this scene and felt rather gratified.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Six’s ability to disguise and stealth has not waned; my careful teaching and nurturing of him back then was not in vain.”<br/>
<br/>
The small smile at the corners of the demon cultivator elder’s mouth vanished swiftly, replaced by a grave look.<br/>
<br/>
He had already received some news.<br/>
<br/>
This news truly shocked him—Liu Er had not become Mulan’s husband; ultimately, the winner turned out to be Liu Er’s subordinate, Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
This contradicted the kingly destiny he had once deduced for Liu Er!<br/>
<br/>
It was truly dire.<br/>
<br/>
Without becoming the son-in-law of the Grand Marshal’s mansion, Liu Er’s half-demon identity was extremely awkward. How could he rise to higher ranks?<br/>
<br/>
That step was extremely crucial.<br/>
<br/>
Missing that step would produce extensive chain reactions, causing the subsequent content following the destined decree to potentially undergo drastic changes!<br/>
<br/>
“I have to find out precisely what happened!”<br/>
<br/>
With that purpose in mind, the demon cultivator elder used his spiritual sense to transmit a message, taking the initiative to contact Liu Er.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er felt both delight and surprise, thinking, “Master hasn’t left yet?”<br/>
<br/>
He arrived in the designated forest and once again paid respects to the demon cultivator elder.<br/>
<br/>
The elder answered with a grunt, barely suppressing his inner anxiety, and stroked his beard as he asked.<br/>
<br/>
Although he had obtained the news, he did not know the full details and had to consult Liu Er, who was personally involved, to understand more of the inside story.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er certainly did not hide anything from his master. At once, brimming with mixed emotions, he recounted everything in detail.<br/>
<br/>
After learning all of it, the demon cultivator elder fell into a long silence.<br/>
<br/>
In Liu Er’s memory, he had seldom seen his master behave this way. Thus, he felt even more apprehensive and asked timidly, “Master, did I mess this up!”<br/>
<br/>
The demon cultivator elder came back to his senses and looked at Liu Er, who was shrinking in on himself like a child caught causing trouble. Outwardly he seemed cautious, but in reality, his mind was quick, watching the elder and gauging the severity of any punishment.<br/>
<br/>
The elder forced a faint smile. “Little Six, you’re overthinking it.”<br/>
<br/>
But Liu Er shook his head. “Master, I’m growing more and more certain that I messed this up!”<br/>
<br/>
“You gave me the Yin-Yang Single Breath Gourd precisely for the purpose of pursuing Mulan.”<br/>
<br/>
“Now, Mulan hasn’t become my wife. I’ve always had a positive impression and feelings toward Ning Zhuo, yet lately, I keep having malicious thoughts toward him, feeling... feeling as though he’s snatched away the greatest treasure of my life.”<br/>
<br/>
“Is that treasure Mulan?”<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that Liu Er had already guessed the truth, the demon cultivator elder sighed softly, then extended a finger to tap Liu Er’s forehead.<br/>
<br/>
And just that simple gesture of confirmation caused the demon cultivator elder to suddenly feel drained after performing it, forcing him to brace himself against a nearby tree trunk.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Liu Er’s heart sank as well. Having studied under the elder, he naturally knew what such a reaction meant.<br/>
<br/>
“Master, careful!” Liu Er quickly took a step forward, helped the demon cultivator elder, and supported him.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er supported the demon cultivator elder to a nearby flat stone, helping him sit down slowly.<br/>
<br/>
Panting a few times, the demon cultivator elder heaved a deep sigh. “Little Six, you are determined to create a human-demon kingdom. Even though you have a kingly destiny, the struggles will be huge. Your life... will be bitter.”<br/>
<br/>
“But each hardship will ultimately temper you, making you stronger, until you finally realize your ambition!”<br/>
<br/>
“This time, although things have turned out like this, it’s not a complete failure yet.”<br/>
<br/>
After uttering these words, he again felt weak and had to pause.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er felt a surge of hope. “Master, is there still a chance for me?”<br/>
<br/>
The elder nodded, took a few breaths, and continued, “That Ning Zhuo is bound to leave. Besides, he wants to preserve his primal yang, so he won’t dual-cultivate with Mulan. This is especially crucial.”<br/>
<br/>
“Dual cultivation... once it happens, both parties’ fates will intertwine, producing a certain qualitative change.”<br/>
<br/>
“That qualitative change can be both good and bad... pfft.”<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the demon cultivator elder coughed up blood, his eyes rolled back, and he almost passed out on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
“Master, Master!” Liu Er was alarmed and promptly employed various methods to treat him.<br/>
<br/>
But the backlash from such divination was rarely cured by ordinary means, so it took the demon cultivator elder himself slowly recovering and using his own techniques for his condition to improve somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at Liu Er, extended a trembling finger, and spoke in extreme weakness. “Go… go lend the Yin-Yang Single Breath Gourd to Ning Zhuo.”<br/>
<br/>
“Under no circumstances let the two of them engage in dual cultivation.”<br/>
<br/>
“You must ensure that you are the one who benefits from Mulan’s primal yin. This is extremely important for you.”<br/>
<br/>
After saying this, the demon cultivator elder suddenly burst apart on the spot, turning into a plume of multicolored smoke, which finally dispersed on the spot.</div>
