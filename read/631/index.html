<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 631: Meng Yaoyin Takes Action!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The siege of White Paper Immortal City had reached a critical stalemate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The sudden appearance of Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had left the South City Gate wide open. This catastrophic breach in the previously impregnable city defenses had fundamentally altered the course of the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Without question, the struggle for the South City Gate had become the linchpin of this assault!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Should the Underworld Army seize the gate and establish a foothold within White Paper Immortal City, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord would secure certain victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Conversely, if White Paper Immortal City's defenders could repel the invaders and reclaim the gate in short order, the conflict would revert to its initial siege phase, ensuring prolonged warfare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"We've gained the advantage!" Xie Sichao exclaimed, standing beside Luo Si at the rear of the Underworld Army. His eyes burned with intensity as he observed the battlefield around the South City Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer's Return to Silence Path Candle had further shifted the balance of power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">She had teleported three Dead Bone Giant Spirits into the fray. Though Ning Zhuo had slain one, two of these colossal beings remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Their massive skeletal frames provided astonishing defense, making them formidable obstacles that would prove difficult to eliminate in the short term.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Meanwhile, the Paper Giant that had threatened them lay writhing on the ground. Inside, two Golden Core-level Ghost Generals relentlessly assaulted its core, plunging the colossal figure into both internal strife and external peril.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The battle between Yang Sanyan and the Bone Tomb Daoist had reached a fever pitch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Surprisingly, the Bone Tomb Daoist held the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">He multiplied his forms, surrounding Yang Sanyan as he taunted, "Brother Yang, where's your innate talent? Show it now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"I simply adore watching you strut with arrogance, looking down on others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"Heh heh heh, why aren't you using it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Can't find my true form? Or has your eyesight deteriorated so badly that further use might blind you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yang Sanyan snorted coldly, focusing solely on combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Wen Ruanyu and Zhou Wenyan, gravely wounded and unconscious, were protected by Yang Sanyan's efforts, sparing them from certain death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Elsewhere, Tie Guzheng charged toward Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer with resolute determination!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Former comrade, I never thought we'd cross blades!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Though you're controlled, there's no other choice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Tie Guzheng unleashed his full power, his Iron Fan whirling around him as he moved to eliminate Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer outright.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The four ghost generals—Yin Poison, Shadow, Wailing Ghost, and Rock Demon—had already retreated to Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer's side, guarding against any possible attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Tie Guzheng's hair stood on end, his muscles rippling like iron serpents as he whirled his Iron Fan in a blur of black light, parrying numerous strikes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He closed the distance to Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Heh heh, you wish!" Yin Poison Ghost General intercepted first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">His arms shot out, spewing dark green miasma from his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The rolling miasma coalesced into a living wall of viscous, foul-smelling Corrosive Toxin Miasma in an instant!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The Iron Fan's fierce wind slammed into the Miasma Wall like a spear piercing deep-sea mud, its razor edge gradually eroded by the corrosive layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zzzt...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The fan emitted a teeth-grating whine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Tie Guzheng cursed inwardly, hastily withdrawing the fan. In mere breaths, the miasma had already etched pitted scars across the blade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">With his assault halted, Tie Guzheng eyed the mysterious Corrosive Toxin Miasma Wall. He suppressed the urge to charge recklessly, knowing full well that in normal combat, he'd have time to probe the enemy's defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">By testing this move's limitations, Tie Guzheng could gain the confidence needed to counter it effectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">But now, absolutely not.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The military situation burned as urgent as fire, with opportunities fleeting like smoke. He had to push himself to the limit, yet avoid reckless moves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Tie Guzheng knew all too well that as City Guard Commander, he formed a critical part of White Paper Immortal City's defenses. Any mishap could have devastating consequences for the entire battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He had no choice but to retreat and attempt to bypass the Miasma Wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">At that moment, a twisted black shadow silently materialized beneath his feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Shadow Ghost General!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Soul-Binding Rope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Two ropes shot forth like icy, slippery vipers striking their prey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Tie Guzheng detected the danger in time and dodged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">But the Soul-Binding Rope didn't target his True Form—it lashed at the shadows of his legs!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The attack caught Tie Guzheng. A sudden chill and sluggishness erupted from his calves, rapidly spreading through his entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He felt trapped in freezing mud, his movements delayed by crucial moments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Damn it!" Tie Guzheng's heart sank to the depths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">After just one exchange, he realized these Golden Core Ghost Generals were elite military forces. Under normal circumstances, he could have dominated them in single combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Now, each Golden Core Ghost General had been enhanced with Military Might, their combat power skyrocketing to just below Nascent Soul level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">This surpassed Tie Guzheng's capabilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Worse still, Tie Guzheng had to face four opponents simultaneously, breaking through their encirclement to strike at Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">It was practically an impossible task!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Luo Si's face hardened as he observed the spell projection. Within the illusion, Tie Guzheng struggled desperately, trying to breach multiple obstacles to slay Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Though the enemy commander was trapped in a quagmire, creating an advantageous situation, it brought no trace of relief to Luo Si's expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The seasoned commander maintained his composure, his attention encompassing the entire battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Suddenly, his pupils shifted as he focused on a small ox cavalry unit within the army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Sun Lingtong led this cavalry squad, charging at the forefront and bellowing, "Make way! We're storming the Immortal City to secure great military honors!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong's heart burned with urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">He saw the critical situation at the South City Gate, the Paper Giant mobilized, lives hanging by a thread. He knew clearly that Ning Zhuo needed assistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">So, even though this move was somewhat improper, he couldn't care about that anymore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sun Lingtong didn't directly charge at the South City Gate. Instead, he led his troops into the Curved Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">This was the route of the Dead Bone Giant Spirits, which could directly teleport into the Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Sun Lingtong cut the line, leading his troops to rush ahead of a Dead Bone Giant Spirit and successfully enter the White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"That bastard!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"They're disrupting military discipline!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Whose troops are these?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Underworld Army was disciplined, but Sun Lingtong's actions brought many negative effects to the order.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Immediately, reports were made, and some wanted to pursue Sun Lingtong's responsibility. These reports were presented to Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Xie Sichao pretended to casually glance at Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Luo Si remained expressionless. Instead of stopping Sun Lingtong, he ordered: "Dead Bone Giant Spirits, halt your advance! Headless Ghost Cavalry, charge into the city at full speed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">At the same time, he ordered his troops to continue their fierce assault on the South City Gate. The Dead Bone Giant Spirits would not use the Curved Path, but continue attacking the southern wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Tie Guzheng charged left and right, but was easily intercepted by four Golden Core Ghost Generals taking turns to strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Even Tie Guzheng, overwhelmed by the counterattacks of the ghost generals, was forced to retreat toward the rear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This left him even further from Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Commander, the wall is under critical attack!" The Commander's Seal trembled faintly as a plea for help from his subordinate reached him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Tie Guzheng nearly shattered his iron teeth. "Damned!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">He couldn't break through the four ghost generals' defenses, and Luo Si's frontal pressure left him stretched too thin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He knew they had to eliminate Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer; otherwise, the situation would collapse completely. But he lacked the strength and time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He had to return immediately to hold the line. If the southern wall fell and the Underworld Army launched a full assault, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer's Warping Path would lose all strategic value—there would be no need for it anymore. With such wide-open attack space, countless Yin Soldiers could advance simultaneously!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Tie Guzheng, defend the southern wall!" At this critical moment, a white-paper figure flew through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Tie Guzheng's face lit up with excitement. "City Lord!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The newcomer wasn't the City Lord's true form, but her Paper Doll Clone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The situation at the southern gate was so dire that even the Paper Doll Clone couldn't handle it, forcing her to come personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The moment she moved, it immediately sparked intense reactions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Quick! The City Lord Clone has mobilized!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Lord Luo Si, this humble one requests permission to engage!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Let me go! Kill this bitch and the morale of White Paper Immortal City will plummet. We might even draw out her True Form."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">In Lord Luo Si's tent, the atmosphere was charged with fervor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Yet Lord Luo Si remained calm, refusing all requests to engage. Instead, he continued deploying Headless Ghost Riders in waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">This decision left many commanders seething with frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The Headless Ghost Riders weaved through the Curved Path, storming White Paper Immortal City!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">They moved in coordinated groups like shark schools, attacking from all directions and wreaking havoc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The City Lord's Paper Puppet Avatar let out an enraged snort. Her white skirt whirled without wind, the dark runes embroidered on its hem lighting up one by one. Layers of frost-white ripples spread out, visible to the naked eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">In the next instant, the frigid energy transformed into a massive wave of ice that swept across the area. The ground was instantly covered in pale crystalline frost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Over a hundred Ghost Cavalry were frozen solid within the ice crystals, sealed in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The Paper Doll Clone's long hair whipped wildly, each strand emitting countless cold glows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Fizzle... Fizzle... Fizzle...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">A dense barrage of light crackled like a storm striking banana leaves, merging into a fading hum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The radiant beams pierced through the headless ghost riders, collapsing both them and their skeletal warhorses to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">In an instant, the battlefield cleared of all opposition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Witnessing this, the generals around Luo Si paled. The excitement and bloodlust that had fueled their earlier pleas for battle quickly faded, replaced by disappointment and resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Some stole furtive glances at Luo Si, who remained seated motionless, his expression cold as ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The City Lord's Paper Puppet Avatar felt a surge of frustration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Though her combat prowess was formidable, the headless ghost riders surged like an endless tide. For every rider slain, another took its place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"We must eliminate the Curved Path first—that means destroying Little Seer!" The Paper Doll Clone locked onto Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The seer stood motionless, her face blank as she clutched the Return to Silence Path Candle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Her four Golden Core Ghost Generals tensed like warriors facing a great enemy. It was clear the City Lord Clone's combat strength far surpassed Tie Guzheng's—they needed to treat this with utmost caution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"We're here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"Kill them all!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Little Ma, I'm coming! I'm coming!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Qing Chi's cry echoed through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Racing behind her came the fully assembled Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">It had all started when the South City Gate came under threat. Tie Guzheng had immediately issued orders to Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">His command was clear: lead the Qing-Jiao Army to reinforce the battlefront at once!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Qing Chi, who had been chafing at the bit, wasted no time. She barked orders to her troops, urging them to mount their warhorses and form ranks. The assembled army then charged forth like a pack of tigers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Midway to the battlefield, she witnessed the Paper Giant unleashing its fury. A realization struck her: "Little Ma! He must be controlling the colossus!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">This dual motivation—both public duty and personal vengeance—fueled Qing Chi's battle fervor like a raging inferno.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">She charged ahead, azure flames swirling around her frame as she became the vanguard of the assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Behind her rode her father, Qing Yan, a Golden Core-level cultivator. He held aloft the Bone Blade Battle Flag—a banner of translucent white bone, its surface thin as deathly parchment. The banner bore the characters "Qing Jiao" in bold strokes, while a green flame flickered at the tip of the pole.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">This was none other than the Military Armament Bone Blade Battle Flag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">In addition to their unique attire, the Qing-Jiao Army rode extraordinary steeds—military armaments known as Black Blood Paper Horses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">These warhorses stood tall and gaunt, their chests blazing with human-sized balls of emerald ghostfire. Their eyes were empty voids of pitch darkness, devoid of life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Every soldier of the Qing-Jiao Army wore armor. Some wielded Crescent Moon Greatswords, while others carried Void-Piercing Spears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Thud! Thud! Thud!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The two cavalry forces collided in the square behind the South City Gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Qing Chi, leading the charge, unleashed devastating power that shattered the enemy formation. The following Qing-Jiao soldiers, brimming with heroic spirit and fearless of death, completely crushed the Headless Ghost Cavalry!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The Qing-Jiao Army's military armaments weren't just luxurious—they also provided massive charge bonuses, making their assault particularly devastating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">In contrast, the Headless Ghost Cavalry had just been teleported through the Curved Path and hadn't yet gained enough momentum to counterattack effectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">When the two forces clashed, the Headless Ghost Riders were sent flying, their ranks scattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Excellent!" The Paper Doll Clone observed the scene with satisfaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">This single clash had proven the worth of her efforts in cultivating the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">She focused her energy and charged toward Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The Yin Poison Ghost General repeated his trick, spewing forth a wall of dark green miasma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The Paper Doll Clone rippled with frost-white waves, freezing the miasma wall solid. Countless dark green ice crystals shattered and cascaded to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Layers of frost also crystallized across the Yin Poison Ghost General's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">He retreated in panic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The Shadow Ghost General lurked in the ground's shadows, hurling a Soul-Binding Rope at the Paper Doll Clone's projected shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">With a pop, the rope exploded into a dense cloud of black smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The Shadow Ghost General shrieked shrilly, his form contorting as he fled in disarray.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The Wailing Ghost violently shook his bone flute, unleashing a shrill sonic attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">The Paper Doll Clone remained expressionless, the sound attack vanishing like mud sinking into the sea - utterly ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The Rock Demon Ghost General blocked her path. With his massive frame and crossed arms, he smashed toward the Paper Doll Clone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Only now did her momentum finally meet resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">But her relentless assault soon forced the Rock Demon Ghost General to stagger backward, bellowing, "Help! Quick, help!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">The Paper Doll Clone's formidable combat prowess left all four Golden Core Ghost Generals reeling in defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"The situation's dire!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"We must reinforce them immediately!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">"Luo Si, what are you waiting for?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">In Luo Si's tent, the generals couldn't sit still, once again clamoring to take action. The Vanguard General was the most insistent, his words brimming with urgency.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Luo Si gave him a deep look before scanning the room. He waved dismissively. "If you want to go, then go. I won't stop you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"Finally showing some sense!" The Vanguard General sneered. He had his own connections and never respected Luo Si, knowing the latter was just a scapegoat brought in to take the fall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Within the Paper Giant:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Bhudda Doctor - Meng Yaoyin surveyed the surroundings before focusing on Ning Zhuo. "Little Zhuo, you've come here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">"You're still at the Foundation Establishment Stage, yet you've reached White Paper Immortal City?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">"Mama! You're finally awake." Ning Zhuo's eyes reddened with emotion. "I found this place by accident too. I know your plans now. I'll do everything to disrupt the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's schemes!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">"Good boy, you've grown." Bhudda Doctor - Meng Yaoyin reached out to gently stroke Ning Zhuo's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">"Ha ha ha! Here's the core!" The Long Axe Ghost General shattered the Formation space and charged in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">The Scarlet Ghost General followed close behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">The Long Axe Ghost General spotted Ning Zhuo and roared with delight. "The one controlling the Colossus is just a Foundation Establishment brat! Die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">"Hm?" The long-handled scythe in Bhudda Doctor - Meng Yaoyin's hand twitched slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">The Long Axe Ghost General's head rolled onto the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">Eliminated!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
