<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The intense clash between the Shadow Demon Cultivator and Fairy Chanyu erupted with thunderous explosions, startling the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Unexpectedly, this battle unfolded suddenly, turning the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City into a battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Tonight was destined to be a night of fierce and chaotic conflict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The incident occurred abruptly while Fei Si was still handling official duties at his desk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Upon hearing the news, he immediately grabbed the seal on his desk, infused it with mana, and activated part of the city's defensive formation to observe the battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He even replayed the previous battle scenes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Fei Si squinted his eyes, a sharp glint flickering within them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">From Fairy Chanyu's appearance to her subsequent actions, he sensed a strong aura of conspiracy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Reacting swiftly, he immediately ordered the activation of the entire City Lord's Mansion's defensive formation to its maximum capacity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Then, he sent someone to report the urgent situation to Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Finally, he commanded the city guards to gather the people of the City Lord's Mansion and instructed them not to act rashly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Given the unclear situation, he needed to assess the circumstances before making a move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Fairy Chanyu suddenly appeared near the City Lord's Mansion, carrying the Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This Demonic Dao Scripture was evidently the key treasure that had been the subject of intense discussion throughout the city recently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Fairy Chanyu was being pursued and attacked by the Shadow Demon Cultivator, who deliberately revealed that she had the Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">It seemed as if Fairy Chanyu had just stolen the scripture from the City Lord's Mansion and was intercepted by the Shadow Demon Cultivator midway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"This is clearly a frame-up!" Fei Si remained expressionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He reminded himself, "The enemy is in the dark while we are in the light. The enemy has devised various schemes and tricks, and they must have anticipated our response. Therefore, we must not act rashly to avoid falling into their trap."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Just as Fei Si finalized his strategy, he heard a familiar roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Shadow Demon Cultivator, you finally show yourself. Let's see where you can run this time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">A short, one-eyed middle-aged man with bulging muscles, resembling a stone pillar, soared into the sky and charged fiercely at the Shadow Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The newcomer was none other than Meng Kui's right-hand man, Chi Dun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Fei Si's vision darkened momentarily, and he gritted his teeth in anger, "That fool Chi Dun!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Chi Dun charged aggressively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He had no interest in the Demonic Dao Scripture and focused solely on attacking the Shadow Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Shadow Demon Cultivator was actually Sun Lingtong in disguise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Seeing Chi Dun, a Golden Core Stage cultivator, relentlessly pursuing him with a murderous intent, even Sun Lingtong felt immense psychological pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"What's going on?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Meanwhile, at Ning Zhuo's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zheng Shuangjun and Zhou Nongying were hiding, communicating through sound transmission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Tonight, it was their turn to guard Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Neither of them acted hastily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After exchanging thoughts, they also worried that this might be a ploy by the enemy to lure them out and create a defensive loophole around Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Seeing Chi Dun about to catch up to him, Sun Lingtong, disguised as the Shadow Demon Cultivator, quickly took out a bottle of pills and smashed it on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Instantly, the black powder turned into a massive black smoke, rapidly spreading and obscuring everyone's vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Chi Dun, without any hesitation, charged into the thick smoke like a raging bull.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Near Ning Zhuo's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Is that the Shadow Demon Cultivator?" Zhou Nongying asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zheng Shuangjun frowned deeply, using a detection spell to investigate the rapidly spreading black smoke, "It's hard to say. This black smoke seems both real and fake." As he spoke, he took out his signature weapons, the Sun and Moon Twin Hooks, holding them in his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Seeing his companion eager to join the battle, Zhou Nongying quickly stopped him, "Calm down. We must wait for Lord Zhu Xuanji and other Golden Core cultivators to arrive before taking action. If you can't be sure, then this Shadow Demon Cultivator might not be real. It could very well be Fei Si's trick!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Previously, Fairy Chanyu had suddenly attacked Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">After that incident, Zhu Xuanji and others discussed and believed there was a possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">That possibility was that Fairy Chanyu and the City Lord's Mansion were colluding, with the former being hired by Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">If that were the case, then the current battle between Fairy Chanyu and the Shadow Demon Cultivator was a staged performance by the City Lord's Mansion to deal with Zhu Xuanji's side, deliberately spreading a third layer of rumors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The overall plan was—since the public suspected that the City Lord's Mansion had the Demonic Dao Scripture, they would now stage a play where the Demonic Dao Scripture was taken by someone else, proving that the City Lord's Mansion no longer had the scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Boom! Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Deep within the spreading black smoke, a series of terrifying explosions erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Clearly, within the black smoke, Fairy Chanyu and the Shadow Demon Cultivator were engaged in an even more intense battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Fairy Chanyu snorted coldly, seemingly suffering a severe injury, and shouted, "Shadow Demon Cultivator, I'll remember you! If you want this scripture so badly, then go ahead and take it." As she spoke, everyone saw a pink light shooting out from the black smoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The pink light contained a stone tablet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Shortly after, the Shadow Demon Cultivator suddenly burst out of the black smoke, chasing after the Demonic Dao Scripture with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">At that moment, many Golden Core cultivators who witnessed this scene felt a pang of greed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Who wouldn't want to obtain the Demonic Dao Scripture?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Even though they had already formed their Golden Cores and couldn't change their cultivation techniques, the Demonic Dao Scripture was connected to the Lava Immortal Palace and the three major sects, making it incredibly valuable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Even if they couldn't use it themselves, offering it to other forces or trading it would yield immense benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">For a moment, everyone's attention was drawn to the Demonic Dao Scripture flying through the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The Demonic Dao Scripture traced a long arc in the sky above Fire Persimmon Immortal City, falling towards a certain corner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">And that corner was near Ning Zhuo's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">This made Zhou Nongying and the eager Zheng Shuangjun feel a sense of unease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"This is probably the City Lord's Mansion's trick," Zhou Nongying thought to himself. "Brother Zheng, quickly take this scripture away to prevent it from causing chaos and endangering Ning Zhuo's life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zheng Shuangjun, holding his twin hooks, soared into the sky, heading straight for the Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In a nearby house.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">A Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace also felt a strong urge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He had been lurking near Ning Zhuo's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Recently, he had been investigating the source of the rumors, coveting the Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace believed that if he could obtain the scripture, it would greatly benefit his quest for the Lava Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Even if he didn't obtain the Lava Immortal Palace in the future, the Demonic Dao Scripture would still be valuable to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Whether used to cultivate his own forces or offered to the Great Purity Palace, it would be beneficial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">So when he saw the Demonic Dao Scripture falling near him, he immediately felt a strong urge to seize it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He quickly took out a set of pitch-black clothes from his storage ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Fortunately, I prepared in advance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">If Ning Zhuo, Zheng Shuangjun, and Chi Dun were present, they would notice that this set of pitch-black clothes was very similar to those worn by the Shadow Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">It turned out that the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace, due to his righteous identity, found it inconvenient to act directly in many matters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Upon hearing about the Shadow Demon Cultivator, he immediately set about forging these clothes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">After all, what did the deeds of the Shadow Demon Cultivator have to do with a disciple of the Great Purity Palace?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Zheng Shuangjun flew forward, seeing the Demonic Dao Scripture within reach, and reached out to grab it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">A pitch-black figure suddenly collided with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Zheng Shuangjun, holding a hook in one hand, struck fiercely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He and the Shadow Demon Cultivator, the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace, clashed, both retreating, and the resulting shockwave sent the Demonic Dao Scripture flying into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"How is there another Shadow Demon Cultivator?!" Zheng Shuangjun was shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace landed on the ground, immediately rising and soaring into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">With a casual wave, he used his mana to form a large hand, grabbing at the falling Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Don't even think about it!" This time, Zheng Shuangjun intercepted the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He shattered the mana hand with a single hook.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The Shadow Demon Cultivator, Sun Lingtong, was also rushing towards the Demonic Dao Scripture but was further away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Chi Dun followed closely, keeping a tight watch on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Sun Lingtong felt frustrated, "Chi Dun, this brute, has no brains. The Demonic Dao Scripture is right there, yet he insists on chasing me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sun Lingtong glanced at the battlefield, feeling puzzled about the identity of the second Shadow Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Chi Dun's thoughts were simple: "No matter who the real Shadow Demon Cultivator is, I'll just catch the nearest one and beat him up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sun Lingtong ran with all his might, using the buildings of Fire Persimmon Immortal City to hinder Chi Dun's pursuit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Chi Dun, being from the City Lord's Mansion, was somewhat restrained, allowing Sun Lingtong to delay him for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Zheng Shuangjun and the Shadow Demon Cultivator, the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace, were locked in a fierce battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Seeing Sun Lingtong approaching, Fairy Chanyu suddenly appeared, directly at the location of the Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Fairy Chanyu grabbed the Demonic Dao Scripture again, smiling brightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">She flew with the Demonic Dao Scripture, intending to slip into a hidden passage through the Fire Persimmon Immortal City's formation and escape the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">A golden light suddenly shone down!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Fairy Chanyu was enveloped in the golden light, her speed drastically reduced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Within the golden light, Zhu Xuanji's figure emerged, descending from the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Fairy Chanyu repeated her trick, "Want the Demonic Dao Scripture? Here, take it!" This time, she threw the Demonic Dao Scripture directly to the Shadow Demon Cultivator, the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">But Zhu Xuanji ignored the Demonic Dao Scripture and continued to pursue Fairy Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Fairy Chanyu, unable to enter the hidden passage in time, had to temporarily change direction, fleeing while casting spells to attack Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The Shadow Demon Cultivator, the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace, didn't expect "good fortune" to come his way!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">He took a step back and grabbed the Demonic Dao Scripture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The moment he touched the Demonic Dao Scripture, he felt he had comprehended many profound techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Demonic Blood Vein Technique!" The Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace's eyes widened with joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">At that moment, he was certain that this was a genuine Demonic Dao Scripture!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
