<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 574: You’re Not from Around Here?</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The fierce battle on the river raged onward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Bone-chilling Crocodiles hurled themselves recklessly at the ships, their sturdy bodies crashing incessantly into the sides and undersides of the vessels. This was exactly the sort of scenario where Beast-Taming sects excelled: low-intelligence demonic beasts could be easily manipulated into frenzied self-sacrifice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The crocodiles’ relentless assault finally bore fruit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The outermost redwood warship couldn’t withstand the brutal impacts any longer, eventually splitting open to reveal gaping holes. Murky black river water surged inside, quickly followed by the frenzied crocodiles scrambling to invade and massacre the cultivators within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Panic erupted aboard the damaged vessel, cultivators scrambling desperately to patch breaches even as they fought off the armored crocodiles, whose spiny bone plating inflicted grievous wounds. Casualties began to soar alarmingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Worst of all, the defensive formation on the warship rapidly weakened due to structural damage - akin to a fortress wall collapsing under siege.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Soon, even the central vessel began to creak ominously, its railings buckling under the relentless battering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">A particularly formidable crocodile, nearly reaching the Golden Core stage, suddenly leaped aboard the ship’s stern, rampaging wildly among the crew and causing catastrophic casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Yang Weida shouted urgently, “Hold your ground! Hold the line!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">He wanted desperately to unleash his full power; however, the ship’s confined space held him back, for he was fearful of accidentally harming his own comrades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">“Damn it! I’ve been a merchant for years, barely scraping together a fortune. Now that I’ve finally gotten a chance to rise above mediocrity, is it really going to end here?” Yang Weida grit his teeth in frustration, quietly shuffling backwards amidst the chaos, subtly retreating towards the relative safety of the ship’s bow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Yang believed everyone else too occupied with battle to notice his cowardly maneuver. Little did he know that every detail of the battlefield was plainly visible to Sun and Ning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Having just emerged from the devastating war in the Two Note Kingdom, to Sun and Ning, the river skirmish - though intense and brutal - seemed rather trivial by comparison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Flying Bone Shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong skillfully commanded a bone shield hovering in midair, forcefully knocking down a crocodile trying to scale the ship’s side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Malevolent Soul Saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Pivoting flawlessly, as if possessing eyes at the back of his head, Sun cleanly severed the head of another attacking beast with a swift blade stroke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Despite having acquired these magical artifacts only recently, Sun wielded them with astonishing mastery, slaughtering crocodiles with remarkable ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Be careful. I sense a concealed presence lurking deep beneath the river,” Sun secretly communicated to Ning Zhuo through divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Originating from the Void Sect, Sun’s detection skills far exceeded Ning’s own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo mentally nodded in agreement. “Makes sense. The Bone Crocodile Demon clearly has familiarity with Elder Qing Yan and dares ambush this convoy. It’s natural he’d prepare backup.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“They’re all Golden Core cultivators; this hidden threat likely shares similar strength,” Ning added, throwing the harpoon in his grip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The harpoon was a relic he had scavenged from Jiao Ma’s corpse, refining it to enhance his disguise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The harpoon shot forth with incredible power, piercing and instantly killing a crocodile on impact. With a subtle gesture, Ning Zhuo effortlessly drew the harpoon back into his hand, connected to it by spiritual sense and qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Such throwing weapons, unlike swords or sabers which typically remained grasped, could be repeatedly thrown and retrieved, making them particularly versatile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sun guarded the perimeter while Ning Zhuo attacked aggressively; even though they currently wore different identities, their coordination remained flawless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Sun Lingtong had previously crafted his own swordsmanship, and now wielding his blade, each stroke was like the fierce roar of a tiger, decisively clearing crocodiles from their vicinity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo, after brief preparations, continuously unleashed lethal strikes, each throw yielding certain death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“Hey, Little Zhuo, want some excitement?” Sun playfully warned through his divine sense, pretending to stumble from exhaustion, thus allowing a crocodile to break through his defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Falling to one knee dramatically, Sun shouted aloud, “Master, watch out!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo snorted coldly in response, immediately canceling his prepared throw. He spun around nimbly, gathering momentum into a fierce, whip-like motion, smashing his harpoon mercilessly into the crocodile’s underbelly and knocking it clean off the ship into the water below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Sun Lingtong teased through divine sense, “Not bad at all, Little Zhuo. Stylish!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Having trained extensively during his time at the Myriad Medicines Sect, Ning had greatly improved his close-combat skills. The war in Two Note Kingdom further tempered him, granting a composure and grace under pressure that he previously lacked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Knowing Sun was just teasing him due to their master-servant disguise, Ning Zhuo scolded harshly, “Get up, you clumsy iron lump! Keep fighting and stop embarrassing me!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Feigning indignation, Sun glared at Ning, replying reluctantly, “Iron lump obeys!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Though disguised as ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators, their exceptional skills were unmistakable. Revealing only a fraction of their true strength, they’d managed to firmly secure the front of the ship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“These two are powerful! No wonder Commander Qing Yan values them highly,” Yang Weida thought to himself, now safely retreated near the bow, eyeing Sun and Ning with renewed interest as he moved closer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Suddenly, an eerie, sinister laughter echoed across the river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Immediately after, Qing Yan’s stern rebuke echoed over the water: “Who’s skulking around out there?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Hahaha, this old one is Xie Sichao, a Ghost Cultivator. Of course, I ought to be skulking around. I appreciate Commander Qing Yan’s praise,” answered the eerie voice from before, dripping with sarcasm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">With that reply, the speaker’s Golden Core-level aura was unveiled without reservation. The enemy had concealed a second Golden Core cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Alarm swept across the faces of those aboard, their spirits swiftly faltering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“They’re coming - it’s the River Ghosts!” Sun Lingtong’s eyes glowed subtly, instantly reporting the scouting results to Ning Zhuo through divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">In the next breath, the swarm of Piercing Bone Crocodiles quickly retreated, replaced by countless phantoms emerging slowly from beneath the dark river, floating up to encircle the three Redwood Battleships.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Hundreds of River Ghosts, draped in tattered black armor, eyes blazing with eerie, ghostly blue flames, brandished hooks and curved sabers, relentlessly battering against the ships.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The crew fought fiercely, unleashing waves of powerful spells followed by a flurry of magical artifacts, chaotically striking the ghosts, halting their advance temporarily. Over fifty River Ghosts dissipated immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Hahaha, just this?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“I slew my first River Ghost when I was three!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Who around here doesn’t know how to deal with these damned ghosts?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Morale surged among the cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">However, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo simultaneously frowned: “Something’s off about these River Ghosts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The next instant, Xie Sichao unleashed his tactics:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Military Strategy: Swiftness of Soldiers!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Military Strategy: Armor Enhancement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Instantly, the River Ghosts’ defense and speed surged several times over. They braced against the bombardment of spells and artifacts, hacking through ship’s railings and storming aboard in waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The stalemate shattered in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The defenders’ situation deteriorated sharply, teetering on the brink of collapse!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Truthfully, each River Ghost possessed less than sixty percent of a Piercing Bone Crocodile’s strength, but under the boosts provided by the military formations, their power instantly skyrocketed, easily surpassing the crocodiles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Qing Yan burst from the water’s surface, soaring into the air to cast two potent defensive spells onto the three battleships, barely stabilizing the dire situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Yin Soldiers? So you’re from one of the Underworld courts?” Qing Yan’s expression turned grave, filled with anger and apprehension. “Is the Underworld again interfering in the affairs of the mortal realm?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Bone-armored Crocodile Demon emerged from the waters once more, his armor now cracked and broken in many places, and the crocodile mount beneath him replaced entirely. He pointed arrogantly at Qing Yan and sneered, “Even if I told you which Underworld court it was, what could you possibly do about it? Our City Overthrowing Alliance is far more powerful than you’ve imagined!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“Qing Yan, if you kneel and beg now, perhaps I’ll spare your pitiful life.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Xie Sichao, still unseen, leisurely retorted, “We know very well the boundary between Yin and Yang. We have no interest in fully occupying the mortal realm or repeating past wars. The Ghostly Black Marshlands already closely resembles the Underworld. It’s merely a little window through which we Underworld cultivators wish to take a breath of fresh air - surely that’s permissible?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Qing Yan glared at the Crocodile Demon with undisguised disgust. “You mortals collaborating with Underworld powers - you’re utterly shameless!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Shameless?” The Crocodile Demon scoffed, murderous intent blazing. “For the sake of freedom and the purity of this land, our City Overthrowing Alliance must make sacrifices. Reputation is only one of them. This is our conviction!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Qing Yan, today you and your subordinates shall perish here!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">With these words, the Crocodile Demon charged again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The situation had drastically shifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Though the Crocodile Demon alone was no match for Qing Yan, with Xie Sichao’s concealed support, Qing Yan found himself increasingly at a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Forced to order the retreat of the three ships, Qing Yan struggled bitterly, fending off two Golden Core opponents while protecting his subordinates aboard the battleships. Before long, multiple injuries accumulated on his body, pushing him toward defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">If Qing Yan fell now, the fate of everyone aboard the ships would be grimly certain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“Boss, what’s our move?” Ning Zhuo transmitted via divine sense to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun Lingtong glanced back, secretly smiling in approval.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo would undoubtedly have retreated discreetly, biding his time. After all, escaping with the Wandering Dragon was effortless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Yet now, filled with the heroic vigor of the battlefield, Ning Zhuo didn’t consider retreating at all - rather, he felt an urge to fight a great battle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">This decisively suited Sun Lingtong’s tastes perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong quickly responded through divine sense, “I can’t clearly sense the situation at the river bottom, nor Xie Sichao’s exact position. So, our only viable target is that noisy Gold Core cultivator, smugly perched on his crocodile mount, endlessly boasting and flaunting.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Agreed!” Ning Zhuo replied instantly, without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Although both were merely at the Foundation Establishment stage, their hearts harboured no fear when plotting to take down a Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The Two Note War had tempered them; they’d even slain Nascent Soul cultivators before! With such experiences, their bearing naturally differed from the ordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">However, while the two were pretending to fight and secretly scheming, suddenly, another Golden Core aura pierced through the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">A middle-aged scholar appeared, soaring through the air. Holding a brush, he swiftly inscribed characters mid-air, and in mere breaths, wrote down a passage from the “Classic of Rites,” forming a restrictive law.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The restriction transformed into countless characters, scattering across the battlefield and accurately embedding themselves into the bodies of the water ghost soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">In astonishment, everyone saw these fierce water ghosts suddenly drop their weapons. Some slapped their own faces frantically, others knelt down apologizing, and many bowed politely, performing various courteous gestures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The previously savage soldiers suddenly turned into respectful, polite gentlemen. Seizing the opportunity, the village cultivators counterattacked furiously, swiftly slaying over a hundred water ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“It’s Master Wen Ruanyu!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“We’re saved!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Cheers erupted, morale soaring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Qing Yan immediately identified himself and briefed Wen Ruanyu on the situation. Wen Ruanyu nodded slightly, standing high in the sky, swiftly writing countless more characters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Words poured down like torrential rain, utterly shattering the morale of the water ghost soldiers, allowing the villagers to swiftly regain control and push the enemy back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">“Could this be a Confucian Cultivator?” Ning Zhuo widened his eyes. It was his first encounter with such a cultivator in real life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sun Lingtong nodded in confirmation. “Indeed. This is imbued with profound literary energy and national strength, marking him clearly as a Confucian Cultivator.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Confucian Cultivators were rare sights in the Southern Bean Kingdom, just as in Northern Wind and Two Note Kingdom. Their true sanctuary lay in the Hua Zhang Kingdom, a cultivation nation ruled solely by Confucianism, reputedly suppressing all other teachings in favour of Confucian doctrine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With Wen Ruanyu skilfully employing national strength and Confucian techniques, the water ghost soldiers were effortlessly subdued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“At the peak of Golden Core with excellent mentorship, this man isn’t ordinary.” Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong swiftly concluded while observing from afar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Confucian Technique - “Literary Suppression of Martial Force!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Wen Ruanyu hovered high above, literary energy surging vividly around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Under the suppression of his Confucian art, all combat effects on both sides significantly decreased, instantly calming the intensity of the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“Strategist Xie, this man is the right-hand man of White Paper City’s lord. We’d best retreat now,” said the previously belligerent Bone Crocodile Demon, utterly demoralized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">“Hmph, very well,” Xie Sichao agreed coldly, immediately ordering a retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Wen Ruanyu didn’t pursue, instead protecting the ships. Qing Yan attempted to chase but was advised by Wen Ruanyu, “Never chase a desperate foe.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“I still have pressing matters elsewhere,” Wen Ruanyu announced. “Qing Yan, I’ll entrust the rest to you. Head swiftly to White Paper City. If the enemy returns, shatter this jade token - I’ll sense it immediately.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He threw a token to Qing Yan, who quickly thanked him. Wen Ruanyu nodded slightly and flew northward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Yet, after several hundred steps, he abruptly turned back, scanning the cultivators below: “By the way, are there any outsiders among you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The group glanced at each other, eventually settling their gaze upon Yang Weida.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“So, there really is one?” Wen Ruanyu felt something amiss. “Take out everything you carry.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">“What?” Yang Weida exclaimed in confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The surrounding cultivators subtly encircled him, hostility in their eyes. Qing Yan glared sternly at Yang Weida, “Do as Master Wen commands.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Panicking, Yang Weida hastily complied, insisting anxiously, “I swear I’m no spy!” He hurriedly laid out all his possessions for inspection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Though Wen Ruanyu saw no candle flames, he noticed several Soul-Ferrying Lamp Wicks. His heart stirred slightly: “Lord Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer asked me to watch for candle-related items. Do these wicks count?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“Regardless, I’ll take him with me first,” he decided.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Originally stationed in White Paper City managing vital tasks, Wen Ruanyu had been dispatched urgently after a divination by the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, instructing him to search northward for a critical figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Having stumbled upon this river battle and recognizing Qing Yan as an ally from White Paper City, Wen Ruanyu intervened immediately. Discovering Yang Weida, he wasn’t entirely sure but decided to keep Yang Weida close while continuing his investigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Thus, Wen Ruanyu carried away the anxious Yang Weida and flew off. Qing Yan reorganized his subordinates swiftly, resuming their journey toward White Paper City.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
