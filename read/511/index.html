<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor was made of ancient bronze, exuding a sense of majesty and weight, giving off a powerful and sturdy impression. However, the transitions at its edges were not abrupt but rather smooth, with elegant curves that conveyed a sense of compassion and tolerance.<br/>
<br/>
The helmet's forehead was slightly raised, forming a circular halo, reminiscent of the Arhat's divine appearance. The faceplate was relatively smooth, with faintly visible intricate talismans and flickering Buddhist light. The sides of the helmet were designed with horn-like protrusions, not only adding to its intimidating appearance but also effectively defending against side attacks.<br/>
<br/>
The overall design of the helmet was simple yet majestic.<br/>
<br/>
The chestplate depicted an Arhat statue, embodying a protective Buddhist formation.<br/>
<br/>
The back design was the focal point, differing significantly from traditional armor. Extending from the back were six mechanical arms, all constructed from ancient bronze.<br/>
<br/>
Following the arms, golden patterns outlined the internal structure, shimmering with a rich golden Buddhist light.<br/>
<br/>
At the elbows and the connections between the backplate and the arms, multiple small formations were strategically placed to enhance the arms' flexibility and strength.<br/>
<br/>
The six mechanical arms were arranged on either side, descending from top to bottom. The elbows and wrists of each arm slightly extended outward, creating different angles of attack. At first glance, it resembled an ancient bronze spider.<br/>
<br/>
With the six mechanical arms on the back and the two normal arms of the heavy armor, there were a total of eight arms.<br/>
<br/>
There was nothing below the waist.<br/>
<br/>
This heavy armor only covered the upper body, reaching down to the waist. The hips, legs, and feet required the cultivator to supplement with other armor.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo circled around the heavy armor, continuously observing, touching, infusing his spiritual sense, and carefully scanning it.<br/>
<br/>
He discovered that each palm had an empty slot in the center, capable of embedding spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
The palm lines appeared ordinary but were actually a variation of a certain Buddhist spell.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, Ning Zhuo had practiced quite a few Buddhist techniques.<br/>
<br/>
One of the three main techniques he practiced was the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Art. The commonly used Cremation Prajna Spirit Liberation Sutra was also a Buddhist spell.<br/>
<br/>
During his time at the Myriad Medicine Sect, he had also learned the "Bitter Cold Sutra" from Han Zhou, another Buddhist technique.<br/>
<br/>
However, despite Ning Zhuo's knowledge, he still couldn't identify which Buddhist spells the palm lines represented.<br/>
<br/>
He asked Mu Lan.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan shook her head: "I didn't experience the battles back then. This heavy armor was originally a full-body suit, but my father cut it into two parts."<br/>
<br/>
"The lower part was destroyed in battle, and the upper part was repaired later to achieve its current appearance."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded: "I see! No wonder when I looked at the waist, it felt like it had been forcibly repaired and abruptly stopped."<br/>
<br/>
"No matter."<br/>
<br/>
"I can try out the Buddhist spells on these palms to test their effects and power."<br/>
<br/>
As for the other parts, Ning Zhuo's spiritual sense quickly penetrated and swept through them.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, his attention focused on the back of the heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
Undoubtedly, the back design was the core and highlight of the entire mechanical heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
The connections for the arms were not the usual turntable base or hanging support structure but were instead composed of a set of intricate internal mechanisms. Made primarily of Buddhist light bronze and thousand-year Bodhi wood, the framework was constructed and paired with Dharma Treasury gold threads and Guanyin moon rings.<br/>
<br/>
Each arm was not singly connected but was precisely arranged through retractable bearings and levers.<br/>
<br/>
There were at least three layers of connections, making the arms and the back exceptionally sturdy.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood in front of the heavy armor, his expression dazed, his spiritual sense almost entirely absorbed into it.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan, however, was impatient to stay long, as she had important military training duties.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, she coughed to interrupt Ning Zhuo's research.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was startled, his face slightly red as he quickly apologized.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan said, "I'll give you this mechanical heavy armor. Take it back and study it thoroughly."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hugged the mechanical heavy armor: "Really? Thank you so much, Mu Lan. You're such a good person!"<br/>
<br/>
He was so delighted that he was almost at a loss for words.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan was slightly stunned, then chuckled. It was the first time she had seen Ning Zhuo so carried away, showing a more childish side.<br/>
<br/>
Only at this moment did she see that Ning Zhuo was just sixteen years old.<br/>
<br/>
In daily life, the wisdom and composure Ning Zhuo displayed had led Mu Lan to mistake him for someone of her own generation. She had even seen many of her father's traits in Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stored the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor and excitedly left the main camp.<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan watched his retreating figure, sensing his excitement. He was clearly eager to test out the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn't want to try it near the military camp.<br/>
<br/>
He entered the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and traveled through the void, arriving at a remote mountain wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
There, he donned the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor and began to practice.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo infused his spiritual power, gradually activating the mechanical heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
The armor was originally oversized and didn't fit his physique, but the next moment, the internal mechanisms clicked and turned, shrinking the armor to fit his body perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
The internal formations also took effect, making the originally heavy armor increasingly lighter, to the point where Ning Zhuo even felt a sense of lightness.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's mind naturally entered a state of tranquility and peace, clearly due to a certain Buddhist formation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo tried moving his arms, turning his head, and twisting his waist.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately found that each movement was very swift, even a bit uncontrollable.<br/>
<br/>
"The mechanical structure here also has an auxiliary thrust effect."<br/>
<br/>
But this wasn't the main event.<br/>
<br/>
What Ning Zhuo truly looked forward to was the six mechanical arms on the back of the heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
He infused his spiritual sense, attempting to control them.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical arm closest to his left shoulder, on the upper left side, immediately moved.<br/>
<br/>
A series of clinking sounds followed as the ancient bronze components of the mechanical arm moved relative to each other. With Ning Zhuo's spiritual sense, the entire arm began to swing and stretch.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo tried to extend this mechanical arm in front of him, then made it open its five fingers, continuously forming hand seals.<br/>
<br/>
At first, every movement of the arm and fingers was stiff, sometimes with excessive force. The ancient bronze fingers swung out shadows, creating whooshing sounds in the air.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's skill in mechanical manipulation was profound.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he had been practicing these basics since childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, after half a cup of tea, he stood still while the six arms behind him moved freely.<br/>
<br/>
The fingers could also be flexibly controlled, and the movements were no longer jerky but had a human-like fluidity.<br/>
<br/>
However, the arms often collided with each other, causing interference.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, the frequency of such interference and collisions greatly decreased.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gradually coordinated the movements of the six arms. Of course, the speed couldn't be too fast; the faster it was, the more likely errors would occur, causing the arms to "fight" each other.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo began to move, using the mechanical heavy armor to perform basic close-combat maneuvers.<br/>
<br/>
Bang.<br/>
<br/>
He used his shoulder to crash into a boulder, instantly shattering the elephant-sized rock.<br/>
<br/>
Bang, bang, bang, bang.<br/>
<br/>
He then used his eight arms to throw straight punches forward.<br/>
<br/>
The fists moved like the wind, faster and faster, the shadows of the punches flying like a storm.<br/>
<br/>
The boulders and trees that became targets were knocked down and smashed. Dust billowed, and debris and broken branches flew everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, oh, oh!" Inside the Mechanical Wandering Dragon, Sun Lingtong had been watching Ning Zhuo. Seeing this scene, his eyes also lit up with excitement.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, immersed in his practice, was filled with joy.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a glint flashed in his eyes as he sensed a key point within the mechanical heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
He tried infusing spiritual power and controlling a certain talisman with his spiritual sense.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, his eight arms glowed with golden Buddhist light. The light covered the arms, turning them golden and greatly enhancing their defense.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the formations on the arms activated, making each punch faster and faster.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the talisman on his shoulder consumed a large amount of spiritual power, emitting silver moonlight.<br/>
<br/>
The silver moonlight attached to each punch, forming silver-colored punch shadows.<br/>
<br/>
The number of punch shadows rapidly increased!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eight arms were like cast gold, with hundreds of silver moonlight punch shadows between them.<br/>
<br/>
Buddhist technique —Vajra Protection.<br/>
<br/>
Martial formation —Zen Wind Flying Fist Formation.<br/>
<br/>
Buddhist technique —Moonlight Salvation Art.<br/>
<br/>
Combining the three, the mechanical technique —Golden Moon Zen Wind Fist!<br/>
<br/>
Punch shadows filled the sky! The eight golden arms were like giant pillars, like dragons, with countless silver moonlight punch shadows densely layered, dazzling to the eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Under the cover of the punch shadows, grass, trees, and boulders were all reduced to dust.<br/>
<br/>
But there were no loud banging sounds, only a series of whooshing winds.<br/>
<br/>
"Zen Wind Fist, truly living up to its name." As soon as Ning Zhuo used this mechanical technique, his spiritual sense captured relevant information, thus learning the technique's name.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, oh, oh, oh!" Sun Lingtong inside the Mechanical Wandering Dragon jumped up, unable to sit still. Seeing such a dazzling attack, he felt even more excited.<br/>
<br/>
"Cool, so cool! Hurry, Little Zhuo, let me play, let me play!" Sun Lingtong eagerly sent a spiritual message.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, hidden behind the faceplate, had already raised the corners of his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Sun Lingtong's urging, Ning Zhuo suppressed his smile and replied via spiritual sense: "Boss, this isn't playtime. Time is limited, I need to properly test this heavy armor."<br/>
<br/>
"When there's a chance, when there's time, I'll let you play, okay?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong pouted, crossing his arms, looking very unwilling: "Hmph, Little Zhuo, don't I know you?"<br/>
<br/>
"You dare to brush me off now..."<br/>
<br/>
"But forget it, I'll let you off this time."<br/>
<br/>
"After this big battle, you must let me play with this mechanical heavy armor!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly replied: "Ahem, boss, you misunderstand me. Don't worry, when there's time, I'll definitely let you play with this heavy armor!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo repeatedly assured, barely placating Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
He continued to immerse himself, constantly testing the mechanical heavy armor, discovering many powerful and ingenious uses.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't until nightfall when Sun Lingtong reminded Ning Zhuo, who then smacked his lips: "Time really flies!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ah."<br/>
<br/>
"The Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor has delayed me!"<br/>
<br/>
"It's all because it's so fun... no, so important, I need to adapt and master it as soon as possible."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong stomped his feet: "You're really playing, aren't you! Hurry, go back to the camp and hand over the Jade Steel Heavy Armor to the Three Generals' Camp."<br/>
<br/>
"I'll stay in the Mechanical Wandering Dragon and study this Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor for you!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo reluctantly took off the heavy armor, entered the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, and handed the armor to Sun Lingtong, not forgetting to remind him: "Boss, be careful."<br/>
<br/>
"Don't go all out in the Mechanical Wandering Dragon, this heavy armor is quite powerful."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong clung to the mechanical heavy armor, his eyes shining, responding perfunctorily: "I know, I know!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, seeing his expression, was very worried: "Don't break it."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong didn't even turn his head, waving his hand: "Go, go do your proper work."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, reluctantly looking back, only to see Sun Lingtong eagerly climbing into the mechanical heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, boss is so much older than me, yet he still loves to play so much, his playfulness is too strong!"<br/>
<br/>
With a sense of frustration, Ning Zhuo controlled the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, traversing a section of the void, and returned to the vicinity of Wooden Wheel Town.<br/>
<br/>
He exited the Mechanical Wandering Dragon, returned to the Three Generals' Camp, found Liu Er, and informed him of the good news about the heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er was overjoyed and eagerly asked for details.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo briefly explained.<br/>
<br/>
Upon learning that Ning Zhuo had already mobilized the Ning family to produce military equipment, Liu Er couldn't help but admire: "The strategist is indeed the strategist, with such foresight."<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing that a Nascent Soul-level cultivator had delivered the goods, Liu Er secretly marveled: "Ning Zhuo, coming from a great clan, must hold a very high position within his family, otherwise he couldn't have mobilized a Nascent Soul-level cultivator."<br/>
<br/>
"Next, we'll use the Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique. Please allow me to observe." Although Ning Zhuo was preoccupied with the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor, he still had to attend to these important matters.<br/>
<br/>
In a tent, the Three Generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang had already gathered some elite soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
Each of them was given a set of heavy armor.<br/>
<br/>
"Begin," Liu Er ordered.<br/>
<br/>
The elite soldiers, with solemn expressions, each held a dagger and made a deep cut on themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique was a magical technique, the first step of which was to strip the skin from the subject's entire body.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators in the tent were almost all at the Foundation Establishment level, each silently cutting off their own skin, peeling it away.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, all thirty-plus individuals had their flesh exposed, even their scalps cut off, a gruesome sight.<br/>
<br/>
Then, they donned the heavy armor in front of them.<br/>
<br/>
The cold, heavy armor pressed against their flesh, causing the cultivators to groan in pain.<br/>
<br/>
As the Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique was formally cast, the heavy armor seeped into their bodies, intertwining with the fresh, bloody flesh.<br/>
<br/>
During this process, the pain became increasingly intense, causing many cultivators to cry out in agony.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the cultivators maintained the technique, but a few couldn't bear the pain and interrupted the casting.<br/>
<br/>
But immediately, Liu, Guan, and Zhang stepped in to assist, casting the Iron Skin Flesh Armor Technique on the individual cultivators, allowing their flesh and armor to continue merging.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the screams subsided, and in the tent filled with the smell of blood and iron, thirty-plus iron-clad individuals either knelt or lay on the ground, with only one remaining standing.<br/>
<br/>
This piqued the interest of Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei asked the man's name, and the man replied firmly: "This humble one is Chen Zhi, greeting the three generals and the strategist."</div>
