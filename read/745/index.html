<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Zhu Family's messenger made no attempt to conceal his presence. His voice, amplified by a technique, erupted into a thunderous roar that reverberated in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Immediately, Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong saw Situ Xing fly out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Situ Xing's brow furrowed as he glared at the messenger, a cold sneer twisting his lips. "Such audacity! Has Zhu Fenxiang gone mad from her blind faith? Does she truly believe she can defeat me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Hmph, very well, very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Since she so overestimates her abilities, I accept her challenge!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Situ Xing had no choice but to accept.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The Zhu and Situ Clans were mortal enemies. At the Flying Cloud Assembly, Situ Xing and Zhu Fenxiang were the leading Foundation Establishment cultivators representing their respective families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">If Situ Xing were to avoid the battle, it would inevitably tarnish his clan's reputation. In his position, he couldn't afford to back down, allowing the world to look down on him and the Situ Clan, bringing shame upon his family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The messenger slowly pushed the challenge letter forward, watching as it landed in Situ Xing's hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">His expression remained impassive as he turned and flew away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Situ Xing's divine sense swiftly scanned the challenge letter. The message was simple, conveying Zhu Fenxiang's fury and fierce determination to fight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Yet even now, Situ Xing couldn't understand why she had suddenly erupted in anger and sought to confront him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Zhu Fenxiang and I have clashed many times, with victories and defeats shared between us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"What new confidence has emboldened her to challenge me this time?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Situ Xing pondered aloud, his gaze shifting between Shen Xi and Lin Jinglong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The two men slowly flew forward until they stood before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Lin Jinglong said with concern, "Fellow Daoist Situ, since you've accepted Zhu Fenxiang's challenge, you should postpone your conflict with Ning Zhuo. There's no need to fight on two fronts, needlessly increasing the risk."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Situ Xing snorted coldly. "Zhu Fenxiang and I exchanged Stone Tablets in the same batch. Her sudden challenge is not to be underestimated. Ning Zhuo is fortunate! I'll spare him for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Forced to change course, Situ Xing focused his full attention on the formidable enemy who had come knocking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">His lips pressed into a tight line, betraying his resentment. After a moment of silence, his eyes narrowed as he secretly mused, "What madness has seized Zhu Fenxiang? To interfere just as I was about to settle scores with Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"First, I must uncover the truth behind this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Situ Xing's plan mirrored Shen Xi's own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">After parting ways with Situ Xing, Shen Xi immediately dispatched his subordinates to investigate the reason behind Zhu Fenxiang's proactive challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zhu Fenxiang had made no attempt to conceal her actions; the messenger delivering her challenge had done so with great fanfare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Shen Xi quickly uncovered the reason behind Zhu Fenxiang's challenge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Lin Jinglong chuckled, "Fellow Daoist Situ has paid the price for his true nature. Ha ha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Situ Xing fell silent upon learning the cause.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He had never imagined that Zhu Fenxiang would come after him because of a poem he had inscribed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He did recall the poem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">It had been written after he secured first place in his third Rising Cloud Minor Trial, confirming his eligibility for the Stone Tablet. In a drunken fit of inspiration at a tavern, he had scrawled the verse on the wall:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Ancient sheath still bears the night flame's mark,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">New blade thirsts to drink the starlight's spark."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This verse, with its taboo implications, had enraged Zhu Fenxiang, who happened to be at the tavern that night. She immediately destroyed the wall and publicly vowed to make Situ Xing pay dearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"So, Ning Zhuo had nothing to do with this," Situ Xing muttered, resigning himself to his misfortune. "For now, I must deal with Zhu Fenxiang first, then turn my attention to eliminating Ning Zhuo's threat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Lin Jinglong felt he had witnessed a good show.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Shen Xi, however, remained suspicious and secretly continued his investigation, delving deeper into the details of that fateful night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He discovered that a waiter from the tavern had been loudly reciting the poem, proclaiming to the surrounding diners how Situ Xing had composed it in a drunken fit of inspiration. The waiter then publicly recited the poem.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Zhu Fenxiang, who was in a private room, hadn't seen the poem. Hearing the commotion outside, the waiter, proud of Situ Xing's poetic feat, had burst out of the room and angrily smashed the wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Investigate this tavern waiter for me," Shen Xi secretly ordered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">------</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Peak of Foolishness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">In the quiet chamber of the cave residence, stood an altar dedicated to the Foolish Thunder God, complete with a divine statue and ancestral tablet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Incense smoke curled lazily from the burner, casting the room in dim light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">The Blind Foolish Old Man, clad in simple hemp robes, knelt on a meditation cushion, his withered hands pressed together in prayer. He murmured softly, his voice filled with devout reverence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">After a moment, the Blind Foolish Old Man ceased his murmuring and raised his voice: "You've been standing at the entrance for quite some time. If you have something to say, come in and speak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">A middle-aged man and woman pushed open the door and entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">"Father," they said in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">They were the Blind Foolish Old Man's biological children.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">The son spoke first: "Father, I heard you're considering allowing Ning Zhuo to join the Rising Cloud Minor Trial midway?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">The Blind Foolish Old Man remained kneeling, facing the altar, his posture unchanged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">Seeing their father's lack of response, his children immediately understood and knelt behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">Yu Gong finally spoke, "Indeed. Ning Zhuo has passed the Demon Subjugation Hall's Three Trials of the Heart and Qing Huangzi's Trial, earning four first-place titles. His reputation matches his righteous aura. Such a rare talent, a gem among men, would be a testament to our god's glory if he were to receive the Blind Fool Divine Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">"Isn't the purpose of our family's Rising Cloud Minor Trial to spread the name of our divine lord?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">"The stronger Ning Zhuo becomes, the greater our god's influence will grow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Hearing this, the children exchanged worried glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">The son tensed, took a deep breath, and strove to keep his voice steady and earnest. "Father, we must reconsider this matter carefully."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">"Ning Zhuo is undoubtedly a prodigy, riding the crest of his fame, but... Ban Ji is no ordinary talent either!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">"Since our first Rising Cloud Minor Trial, Ban Ji has participated with unwavering devotion, tirelessly cultivating his skills, all for the sake of earning our god's favor. For Ning Zhuo to cut in line now would be the greatest injustice to Ban Ji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">"Ning Zhuo's public rejection of Ban Jie's mediation reveals his youthful arrogance and utter disregard for others. His meteoric rise is like pouring oil on a raging fire - one misstep could lead to his own destruction."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">"He's a foreigner. How could he possibly oppose the Ban Clan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">"Father, it's a clash between two powerful forces. We have no need to get involved," his son said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">Before the Blind Foolish Old Man could speak, his daughter leaned forward, her voice sharp: "My brother speaks the truth! Father, rules are the foundation of our clan's standing. If we make an exception for one person during the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, how will outsiders view our family in the future?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">The Blind Foolish Old Man remained silent for a moment. "Anything else?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">His son gritted his teeth, his tone deepening: "Father, you've always taught us to consider the future of our descendants and the Mountain-Moving plan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">"Our clan has endured generations of blood feuds, and our path forward is strewn with thorns. What we need isn't to make more enemies, but to cultivate alliances and accumulate every ounce of potential strength! Even if the Ban Clan can't be allies, they must never become enemies!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">The Blind Foolish Old Man: "Then how can you be so sure Ning Zhuo and his backers are weaker than the Ban Clan? Wouldn't refusing his request also make an enemy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">His daughter's expression turned severe: "Father, the Ban Clan is right here in our territory. Whether Ning Zhuo's support comes from a family or a sect, their reach is limited. And..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">At this point, she switched to divine sense communication: "Father, you want to spread the name of our god, but there's no need to risk our entire family for it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">"The Foolish Thunder God has indeed greatly aided our clan, serving as a crucial force in our Mountain-Moving plan. But..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">"He only recently ascended to godhood, retaining much of his humanity. His lingering ties to our bloodline and old affections still influence him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">The daughter paused, then continued with newfound courage, "Divinity is eternal, while humanity fades! What will happen after decades, even centuries?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">"When his humanity dissipates, leaving only cold, detached divinity, will the Foolish Thunder God still help our clan against the Mountain God?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">The son interjected, his divine sense conveying his impassioned words, "Father, if we truly want to move the mountains and fulfill our ancestors' unfinished ambition, we can't rely on divine favors or fleeting whims. Ultimately, it depends on the enduring bloodline of the Yu Clan! It requires generations of resilience, meticulous planning, and unwavering determination!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">"By introducing Ning Zhuo to spread the God's name, are we truly advancing our clan's grand strategy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">"Making an exception for Ning Zhuo and antagonizing the Ban Clan - at best, it diminishes our clan's prospects for growth. At worst, it undermines the very foundation of our clan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">The Blind Foolish Old Man, his back turned to his children, felt a vein bulge on his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">He remained silent for an agonizingly long time, so long that the incense ash in the burner formed a thick, elongated layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">In the oppressive atmosphere, his children dared not speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">Only the heavy sound of breathing filled the silent chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">"Heh." The Blind Foolish Old Man suddenly chuckled softly, his laughter dry and desolate, like withered branches scraping against each other in the cold wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Without turning around, he transmitted his thoughts through divine sense: "You two grew up right under my nose. How could you possibly have such an understanding?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">"Tell me, what benefits did the Ban Clan offer you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">His son and daughter both flinched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">The daughter swallowed hard and forced out a strained voice: "Father..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">The son, however, immediately dropped to his knees, his voice choked with sobs as he pleaded: "Father! We... we did accept their offer. We wouldn't dare hide it from you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">"But we truly believe this is for the good of the clan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">"How many years has the Yu Clan been living under the Myriad Manifestations Sect's roof? We've been relying on others, and our clan has stagnated!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">"The Ban Clan's power is immense. Their envoy spoke to us with... less than friendly words."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">"Father! You are the pillar of our clan! As long as you're here, the Ban Clan will still show some restraint. But... once you ascend to immortality, the Yu Clan will be like a dilapidated house without its main support beam, tossed about by wind and rain! The Ban Clan could topple us with a single push... How could we possibly resist?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">The Blind Foolish Old Man froze at these words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">His daughter began to wail, "Father! I beg you, for the sake of our ancestors, for the sake of the Mountain-Moving legacy, please spare us, your unworthy descendants... a path to survival! We... we can't afford to oppose the Ban Clan now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">The Blind Foolish Old Man's usually ramrod-straight spine slumped an inch under the weight of her words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">His empty eye sockets "gazed" toward the incense altar, now betraying a hint of confusion and bitterness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">The statue of the Foolish Thunder God loomed over him with cold indifference. The blue smoke from the incense burner swirled before him, mirroring his own chaotic and icy state of mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">After a long silence, he finally let out a sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">The sigh was long and heavy, as if it had drained every last ounce of his vitality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">The sound echoed through the quiet chamber, deepening the already dim room into an even darker gloom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">"With children like you, how can our clan ever prosper?" The Blind Foolish Old Man's words flushed his son and daughter with shame.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">"Very well. My days are numbered anyway. The clan's future rests in your hands. Do as you see fit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">His daughter's sobs gradually subsided.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">His son's Adam's apple bobbed as he forced out a strained whisper, "Father..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">Several hours later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">Green Stone Cave Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Chen San stood with his hands pressed tightly against the seams of his trousers, his upper body slightly bowed, his head lowered in respectful deference as he faced Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">He had just finished his report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">He brought Ning Zhuo both good news and bad news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">Ning Zhuo pondered aloud, "The Blind Foolish Old Man has rejected my invitation. It seems Ban Ji will undoubtedly claim first place in their Rising Cloud Minor Trial."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">"With this, he'll have accumulated three first-place finishes, enough to exchange for a Stone Tablet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">Chen San quickly interjected, "Even so, Ban Ji is still behind schedule. He's no longer considered among the first wave of achievers, and he can't compare to you, Young Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Ning Zhuo shook his head. "Ban Ji's talent and skill are undoubtedly first-rate. There's no question about that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Chen San immediately seized the opportunity to flatter, "Still, Young Master, your methods are far superior. You managed to kick him out of Qing Huangzi's Rising Cloud Minor Trial. This humble servant exhausted every effort, yet couldn't even meet the Blind Foolish Old Man. I've failed to fulfill your trust and performed poorly. I am truly ashamed. Please punish me, Young Master!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but chuckle softly. "Chen San, you're a lone-cultivator by origin. Why are you acting so... restrained?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">"This is... 'restraint'?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Chen San seized the opportunity to flatter Ning Zhuo. "For ordinary people, I might be a bit lax. But before you, Young Master, I find myself utterly devoted and dare not slacken my efforts in the slightest."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Ning Zhuo raised a hand. "Enough. Do you think I'm so foolish as to misunderstand the situation? I don't blame you for the incident. The Ban Clan must have moved preemptively to block our efforts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">"Just as I anticipated Situ Xing's actions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">Chen San tilted his head back, "bravely" meeting Ning Zhuo's gaze to ensure his face radiated admiration. "Young Master, your strategic brilliance allows you to orchestrate victory from a thousand li away. By following your instructions, I provoked Zhu Fenxiang's anger, driving her to confront Situ Xing. Your schemes are truly profound - beyond comprehension!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly, his gaze piercing as he studied Chen San. "I merely gave you the orders. The specific execution depended entirely on your improvisation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">"You handled this well. You timed the tavern workers' poetry recitation perfectly, subtly nudging events into motion with minimal traces. Now, what reward do you desire?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Chen San immediately knelt on one knee. "Young Master, this subordinate dares not claim any credit. The idea of using Situ Xing's poem came entirely from your instructions. When you issued the order, you pointed out several exploitable opportunities, and this poem was one of them!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">"I merely ran errands and followed your orders, which led to effortless success."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">"How could this subordinate possibly ask for a reward? To continue serving under your command is the greatest reward imaginable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">Chen San's flattery flowed smoothly, each compliment delivered with practiced ease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">His tone shifted, revealing a hint of hesitation. "However, the innkeeper's assistant who recited the poem was publicly knocked unconscious by Zhu Fenxiang. The inn suffered losses and dismissed him. Now, severely injured and bedridden, he presents an ideal opportunity to strike..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">Ning Zhuo's expression turned stern, his voice hardening. "Absolutely not."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">"As a member of a reputable sect, I refuse to stoop to such vile tactics."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">"Arrange for the assistant's relocation. Send him away from the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main gate, preferably abroad. I will cover all expenses - spare no expense in this matter!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
