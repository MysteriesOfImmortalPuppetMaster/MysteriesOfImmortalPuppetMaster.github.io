<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"According to Li Leifeng's assessment, Ning Zhuo possesses profound mechanical talent, predicting that he would stand out by the age of six. However, in reality, Ning Zhuo remained unremarkable until the recent emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace, where he finally showcased his innate talent, becoming a figure of renown." Zhu Xuanji had long collected extensive information on Ning Zhuo, understanding his growth trajectory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Previously, Zhu Xuanji believed that Ning Zhuo had been accumulating strength, waiting for the right moment to shine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">After reforming his cultivation, he gradually discovered his own talent and began to radiate brilliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">But now, Li Leifeng's jade slip shattered his previous understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"If Ning Zhuo could perform the 'Fang Qing's Vindication Play' at the age of five, judging by his control over puppets, his foundational skills are extremely solid!" "Ning Zhuo's failure in the Ning family's grand examination due to nervousness was clearly an act." "It seems that Ning Zhuo has been concealing his abilities and disguising himself from a very young age." "He continued to hide for over a decade, only recently choosing to reveal his sharpness." "Why?" Zhu Xuanji felt deeply puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Why would Ning Zhuo, a branch member of the Ning family, choose to hide his talents and disguise himself?" "Throughout his long academic life, why did he choose to appear so ordinary?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Clearly, if Ning Zhuo had showcased his talents and innate abilities, he could have received focused cultivation from the family!" Zhu Xuanji thought of Ning Xiaohui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Could it be that there is internal strife within the Ning family?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"The key is, if this kid started disguising himself from the age of three or four, what kind of mind does he possess?" "Such deep thoughts are too profound!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Thinking of this, Zhu Xuanji felt a chill rise in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"So, did Ning Zhuo deliberately hide himself for over a decade?" "During this time, did Ning Zhuo not have any youthful vanity or impulsiveness?" "Or is there a master guiding him from the shadows?" Zhu Xuanji's doubts grew more and more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The more he discovered, the more questions arose in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Ning Zhuo has issues!" Zhu Xuanji affirmed in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He had begun to suspect Ning Zhuo before, but he knew that such suspicions were baseless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He just felt that there was something inexplicably strange and unnatural about Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Now, Zhu Xuanji understood the reason!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"I have investigated countless cases, pursued true criminals, and accumulated a wealth of experience, cultivating a sense of intuition for solving cases." "Ning Zhuo performed excellently, without any obvious flaws or unreasonable points."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"However, a performance is still a performance, and there is always a gap between it and reality!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Zhu Xuanji had seen too much of reality and falsehood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Although sometimes he couldn't rationally determine it, he could feel the strangeness and unnaturalness in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">When this unnatural feeling accumulated to a certain extent, Zhu Xuanji couldn't help but start suspecting Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Ning Zhuo, you little fellow, what role exactly are you playing in the struggle surrounding the Lava Immortal Palace?" Zhu Xuanji frowned, looking towards the night sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Tonight, the moonlight was hazy, covered by clouds and mist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Various pieces of information and ineffective clues flashed in Zhu Xuanji's mind, rising and falling, mixing together into a massive vortex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Zhu Xuanji stared at the clouds covering the moonlight, as if seeing the fog in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He had a strong feelingâ€”just one last piece of the puzzle was missing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Like a jigsaw puzzle, just missing that final crucial piece!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Once he found and pieced it together, he could tear away the fog before him, allowing the moon named truth to fully emerge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"So... the Historical Records Pavilion is that final piece of the puzzle!" Zhu Xuanji's eyes shone with golden light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He felt an impulse rising in his heart, wanting to fly back to the Lava Immortal Palace immediately and personally oversee Ning Xiaohui's thorough investigation of the Historical Records Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"No, no, no, I can't do that." Zhu Xuanji lowered his head, pacing back and forth, deep in thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He was completely immersed in his world of thought, forgetting everything around him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Zhu Hou saw him thinking so deeply, and couldn't help but smile, watching quietly without making a sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">As a senior, seeing such excellent performance from the younger generation of the royal family filled him with appreciation and comfort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zhu Xuanji quickly reviewed past events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">From his arrival at Fire Persimmon Immortal City to now, the various incidents he experienced, Ning Zhuo's appearances were indeed too frequent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Ning Zhuo should be playing a relatively important role." "Perhaps he is the biggest fog obscuring the truth!" "But I can't unravel it; I lack direct evidence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Even if I present Li Leifeng's list, Ning Zhuo has countless explanations and excuses." "In fact, even if he admits to disguising himself for over a decade, what then?" "Perhaps I should conduct a surprise inspection to see what he commonly uses in his storage equipment?" "No, that's not right either!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zhu Xuanji thought that Ning Zhuo was merely at the Qi Refining Stage, and even if he was deeply connected with the mastermind, he was just a useful pawn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Even if Zhu Xuanji pried open this pawn and saw the color it had been hiding, what then?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"It would only alert the enemy and provoke conflict." "Currently, Ning Xiaohui is a key, and Ning Zhuo is another key." Zhu Xuanji thought of this and made a decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">He first wrote a secret letter to inquire about Zhu Zhen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">After Zhu Zhen terminated the investigation, he secretly approached Zhu Xuanji, expressing his willingness to contribute more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhu Xuanji arranged for him to stay in the Lava Immortal Palace, without revealing his royal identity, disguised as an outsider cultivator, diligently completing tasks and earning merits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">In fact, Zhu Xuanji had another important task for Zhu Zhenâ€”recently, Zhu Zhen had been secretly responsible for protecting and monitoring Ning Xiaohui!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Now that I'm outside the Immortal Palace, it's actually an opportunity." Zhu Xuanji crafted a jade slip secret message, instructing Zhu Zhen to fully protect Ning Xiaohui!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">At the same time, Zhu Xuanji took out a mirror from his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">This mirror was exquisitely beautiful to the extreme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The entire mirror was surrounded by a lifelike golden phoenix.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The phoenix's wings embraced the mirror surface, its feathers fine as silk, extremely delicate, as if each feather was gently fluttering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The phoenix's head was held high, its eyes like stars, exuding majesty and mystery, its beak slightly open, as if chanting an ancient incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Its long tail meandered down, the tail feathers lightly coiling around the bottom of the mirror frame, forming a graceful arc, adding a touch of softness and agility to the mirror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Golden Phoenix Mirror!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">This was a treasure Zhu Xuanji had taken from the Southern Bean Kingdom's treasury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The King of the Southern Bean Kingdom had specifically told him that this Golden Phoenix Mirror originally belonged to the Lava Immortal Palace, but was seized by the former emperor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">If returned to the Lava Immortal Palace, it would surely earn a huge merit!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhu Xuanji held this treasure mirror in his hand as a trump card, to be used at the right moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Now, he decisively took it out, deciding to secretly hand it over to Ning Xiaohui through Zhu Zhen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">By having Ning Xiaohui submit it, she could quickly gain a significant merit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">In this way, Ning Xiaohui could instantly acquire the position at the Historical Records Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">This was the most crucial breakthrough in the current situation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Zhu Xuanji originally didn't plan to pay such a heavy price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">But at this moment, after receiving Li Leifeng's list, he felt a chill from Ning Zhuo, prompting him to make this decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Ning Zhuo... he is another key, the most important witness." "He should also be fully won over!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Thinking of this, Zhu Xuanji's eyes focused, fully returning to his senses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He smiled apologetically at Zhu Hou.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Zhu Hou waved his hand, unconcerned: "Being able to help you, I feel deeply gratified."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhu Xuanji said, "Uncle, I've changed my mind. Tomorrow I will attend your succession ceremony, and I will bring another person." Zhu Hou was curious: "Oh? You were thinking so hard just now because of this person?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhu Xuanji had nothing to hide from Zhu Hou, and directly admitted: "That's right, this person is Ning Zhuo, the talent recorded in Li Leifeng's list." "Although he is only a Qi Refining Stage cultivator, only sixteen years old, he is the most unique young man I've ever seen." "Many times, I can't figure him out either!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Zhu Hou was immediately surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He had watched the young Zhu Xuanji advance step by step, very aware of Zhu Xuanji's talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">It was the first time he saw Zhu Xuanji speak so highly of someone! And this person was only at the Qi Refining Stage, only sixteen years old.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Zhu Hou was extremely curious, laughing heartily: "Hahaha, this makes me look forward to tomorrow's succession ceremony even more." "Ning Zhuo, is it? I must take a good look at what kind of young genius can catch your eye, Zhu Xuanji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The next day.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Not good, not good! Young master, wake up, wake up quickly!" The anxious voice of the dragon turtle fire spirit woke Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo lay on the bed, suddenly opening his eyes: "What happened? Has the Lava Immortal Palace's defensive barrier shattered?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The dragon turtle fire spirit replied, "No, it's worse than that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"This morning, Ning Xiaohui received a magical artifact called the Golden Phoenix Mirror and is about to present it to the Immortal Palace!" "The Golden Phoenix Mirror originally belonged to the Immortal Palace, paired with the Jade Dragon Mirror, specifically for the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique." "Now, by submitting such an important magical artifact, her merit will soar, instantly surpassing the minimum standard for the Historical Records Pavilion position!" The dragon turtle fire spirit was extremely anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo's heartstrings tightened, and he immediately sat up: "What?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He was about to continue questioning the dragon turtle fire spirit about this urgent situation when Ning Jiufan's voice came from outside: "Ning Zhuo, wake up, the old man is taking you out." Ning Zhuo's heart skipped a beat, and he hurriedly, wearing only his inner garment, pushed the door open and saluted Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Jiufan grabbed Ning Zhuo by the collar and flew into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">On the way, he explained, "Today, the Orphanage is holding a succession ceremony. Zhu Xuanji is hosting this event, and since you have donated to the Orphanage many times, he specially invited you to attend." "I didn't expect Lord Zhu Xuanji to think so highly of you. Little Zhuo, you must perform well." "Understood?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo's heart was icy cold, but outwardly he appeared extremely delighted: "I have always been grateful to Lord Li Leifeng! When I was young, I stole leftover pastries from guests at the Orphanage. Lord Li Leifeng discovered me but didn't drive me away and even treated me to many new tea pastries."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The dragon turtle fire spirit was dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">It watched Ning Zhuo being taken away, leaving the Lava Immortal Palace, and only then did it react, instinctively extending its dragon claw, fingers wide open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The dragon turtle fire spirit watched Ning Zhuo's distant direction, shouting loudly: "No!" "Come back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Ning Zhuo, come back quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Ning Xiaohui is about to enter the Historical Records Pavilion and learn the whole truth!" Ning Zhuo's heart was filled with dread, as if he were standing in a snowy field, chilled to the bone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Ning Xiaohui suddenly has a magical artifact to submit, and at this critical juncture, I am taken away from the Lava Immortal Palace." "This must be Zhu Xuanji's doing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"Zhu Xuanji suspects me even more deeply. Where did I reveal a flaw?" "Could it be that Han Ming has been captured?!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
