<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 221: For Ning Zhuo, I Got Whipped</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Hey, Ning Zhuo, what are you doing?" "At this critical moment, you're still exploring the Immortal Palace!" "Do you not understand the urgency of the situation?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been closely monitoring Ning Zhuo's every move, pacing anxiously in the main hall.<br/>
<br/>
"Hurry up and deal with Ning Xiaohui!" "If you keep dragging this out, she'll discover our secret!" "I'm so anxious, I'm practically on fire!"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit growled, and indeed, a flame burst forth from its head.<br/>
<br/>
When it became agitated or angry to a certain extent, parts of its body would ignite.<br/>
<br/>
If the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit were Ning Zhuo, it would immediately use the Life-Hanging Thread to deal with Ning Xiaohui! But now, Ning Zhuo was acting as if nothing was wrong, leisurely exploring the Lava Immortal Palace!<br/>
<br/>
This drove the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit to the brink of madness.<br/>
<br/>
It wanted to grab Ning Zhuo by the ear and loudly question him—are you trying to get yourself killed by dawdling like this?!<br/>
<br/>
However, it ultimately didn't dare to do so.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it lacked the courage to speak to Ning Zhuo again.<br/>
<br/>
It was very worried that it might accidentally reveal something, and Ning Zhuo would see through it!<br/>
<br/>
While the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was anxious and hesitant, Ning Zhuo had already reached out to touch the door to the next room.<br/>
<br/>
There was no reward for passing through the door, nor was there any blood energy.<br/>
<br/>
This somewhat surprised Ning Zhuo: "No blood energy, how can I use the Blood Path Diagram?"<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he and Yuan Dasheng officially stepped into the penultimate stage of the Demonic Gate path.<br/>
<br/>
Thousands of eyes, glowing with blood-red light, stared at them simultaneously!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was astonished.<br/>
<br/>
He had never seen so many martial puppets before.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of puppets stood in an orderly fashion, all attracted by the commotion at the door.<br/>
<br/>
This was an army of mechanical puppets!<br/>
<br/>
Each puppet had eyes glowing red, or their bodies were shrouded in a layer of blood energy, exuding a Qi Refining Stage aura ranging from one to nine layers.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes also lit up: "So the blood energy provided by this stage isn't from the door, but from these puppets."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng appear, the mechanical puppets activated and charged at them.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of puppets moved together, like a tidal wave, bringing a strong sense of oppression to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"Master, step back, I will protect you," Yuan Dasheng stepped forward, like a city gate, blocking Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Its body was solid, having undergone the Buddhist Gate path's enhancements, far surpassing its original state.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, it had been heavily repaired by Ning Xiaohui, looking brand new, with a bright red body and exposed golden bones, exuding a domineering and reliable aura.<br/>
<br/>
The martial puppets that approached were all struck down by Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's martial skills were superb, using both fists and feet, single-handedly defeating countless enemies.<br/>
<br/>
Bang, bang, bang.<br/>
<br/>
Many martial puppets were struck by it, some were thrown far away, some were directly disassembled, and some were knocked into a group of their allies.<br/>
<br/>
However, the number of martial puppets was overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng only had spiritual power, not blood energy, and was not in its best state.<br/>
<br/>
It was concerned about Ning Zhuo's safety behind it, and facing the tidal wave of enemies, it could only retreat step by step.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Ning Zhuo immediately cast spells.<br/>
<br/>
Flames, frost, lightning, and wind blades descended, but they only triggered the blood energy defenses of the martial puppets.<br/>
<br/>
Each puppet was now covered in a blood muscle armor, significantly reducing the damage from the spells.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn," Ning Zhuo's heart sank, realizing that his spells had backfired, activating the puppets' stronger abilities.<br/>
<br/>
"Yuan Dasheng has been using only fists and feet, defeating many puppets without triggering their blood energy." "This stage might not encourage the use of spells at all. Pure martial skills might be the key to passing this stage," Ning Zhuo speculated.<br/>
<br/>
However, martial skills were Ning Zhuo's weak point.<br/>
<br/>
When he first reached the third stage, he was thoroughly taught a lesson by a martial puppet.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, he had to rely on the Embrace Ice Technique to extricate himself and pass the stage.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had always wanted to hone his martial skills, but he was too busy to find the time.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stopped using spells, and the demonic puppets also ceased using blood energy.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng was just one, and the numerous puppets surrounded them from all sides.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had no choice but to engage in close combat.<br/>
<br/>
His basic martial skills were solid, allowing him to handle two or three puppets at once.<br/>
<br/>
But now, he faced attacks from over a dozen puppets from all directions.<br/>
<br/>
Forced to constantly move, Ning Zhuo relied on guerrilla tactics to buy time.<br/>
<br/>
As more and more demonic puppets surrounded him, the space for Ning Zhuo to maneuver and break through grew smaller, filling him with dread.<br/>
<br/>
"Is this the end of my attempt to pass this stage?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sensed impending defeat but was also puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
He had passed the Buddhist Gate path and fully completed it.<br/>
<br/>
"Compared to the second stage of the Buddhist Gate, the difficulty of this Demonic Gate stage is hundreds of times greater!" "This is clearly unreasonable."<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, a large group of mechanical puppets pounced on the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Each puppet emitted blood energy, forming blood muscles that reinforced their bodies and increased their strength.<br/>
<br/>
They piled on Yuan Dasheng like a mountain, pressing it down.<br/>
<br/>
Then, their blood muscle armors merged, forming a massive blood energy that sealed Yuan Dasheng entirely, creating enormous blood muscle shackles.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn!" Ning Zhuo cursed inwardly, about to cast a spell to break the siege.<br/>
<br/>
Just then, an unexpected change occurred.<br/>
<br/>
The blood muscle shackles on Yuan Dasheng lasted only a moment before turning back into blood energy, which was absorbed into Yuan Dasheng's body.<br/>
<br/>
To be precise, it was absorbed into the Blood Path Diagram within Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Ning Zhuo understood!<br/>
<br/>
"I get it, this is the correct way to pass the stage!" "The Blood Path Diagram is used like this!"<br/>
<br/>
When the Blood Path Diagram contains blood energy, it allows mechanical constructs to use the corresponding level of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.<br/>
<br/>
When it lacks blood energy, it can absorb demonic blood energy from the outside!<br/>
<br/>
These demonic puppets intended to imprison Yuan Dasheng, but instead, they delivered a great gift.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Yuan Dasheng had no blood energy to use, but now, with this substantial gift, its combat power surged.<br/>
<br/>
With a roar, Yuan Dasheng's muscles bulged, and blood energy surged, forming a blood-colored sphere that rapidly expanded outward.<br/>
<br/>
The layers of mechanical puppets piled on it were all knocked away, crashing to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Many puppets couldn't withstand the intense blood energy shock and disintegrated mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng roared, clenching its fists like war hammers, swinging them like the wind.<br/>
<br/>
It charged forward, unstoppable, with no mechanical puppet able to match it under the influence of the blood energy.<br/>
<br/>
Many demonic puppets shattered under its fists and feet.<br/>
<br/>
However, the good times didn't last long.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's combat power gradually weakened.<br/>
<br/>
There were too many enemies.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's attacks consumed blood energy rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
Without sufficient blood energy, its combat power was significantly affected!<br/>
<br/>
Enemies were everywhere, coming in an endless stream.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo reminded Yuan Dasheng to continue absorbing blood energy.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng obeyed, grabbing a puppet's head.<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Path Diagram activated, emitting a strong suction force, causing the puppet to tremble.<br/>
<br/>
Blood energy flowed from the puppet's body, through its head, along the arm, and into the Blood Path Diagram within Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Without blood energy, the puppet immediately weakened, becoming extremely fragile.<br/>
<br/>
Bang.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng crushed the puppet's head with both hands.<br/>
<br/>
Its attacks were often concentrated in its hands!<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng continued to grab and crush, absorbing the puppets' blood energy and then destroying them.<br/>
<br/>
Although the demonic puppets were numerous, they lacked intelligence and couldn't counter Yuan Dasheng's actions.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, Yuan Dasheng, having reached the Wisdom Spirit Stage, learned from the battle and began to focus on blood energy reserves.<br/>
<br/>
It preferred to take hits rather than miss the chance to absorb the puppets' blood energy into its Blood Path Diagram.<br/>
<br/>
The more blood energy Yuan Dasheng absorbed, the stronger it became, creating a positive feedback loop.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng stabilized its position and became increasingly unstoppable.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Ning Zhuo felt gratified but also puzzled.<br/>
<br/>
"With the correct method, this Demonic Gate stage becomes very simple. The real difficulty is much lower than the Buddhist Gate." "This is also unreasonable."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pondered deeply.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, a flash of insight struck him, and he considered a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
He personally tested it in battle, choosing demonic puppets as opponents and experimenting multiple times, gaining a deep understanding of the stage's mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that the Blood Path Diagram's absorption capacity had limits.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's Blood Path Diagram was inscribed with the eighth layer of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, meaning it could absorb blood energy up to the eighth layer of the Qi Refining Stage.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn't handle the ninth layer of blood energy.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, absorbing the eighth layer was already challenging.<br/>
<br/>
"The three sects' elders designed this stage to focus on the application of the Blood Path Diagram."<br/>
<br/>
"In the early stage, use guerrilla tactics to delay time, extend the battle line, and choose lower-level puppets to absorb their blood energy." "In the mid-stage, use the absorbed blood energy to enhance combat power, eliminating puppets while sustaining oneself." "In the late stage, deal with the tougher opponents, fighting fiercely to carve a path through the blood and pass the stage!"<br/>
<br/>
Spells couldn't be used.<br/>
<br/>
Using them would trigger many martial puppets to activate their blood muscles, significantly increasing their combat power.<br/>
<br/>
This would not only increase the pressure on the cultivators but also drastically reduce the blood energy they could harvest.<br/>
<br/>
"So, the difficulty of this stage is related to the Blood Path Diagram."<br/>
<br/>
"A Blood Path Diagram with the ninth layer of demonic technique has the lowest difficulty. The lower the level, the higher the difficulty!" "However..."<br/>
<br/>
"I have Yuan Dasheng, which was refined using the true scripture of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique. This allowed it to create a Foundation Establishment Stage Blood Path Diagram in the previous stage." "This diagram suppresses all demonic puppets in this stage, making it an unparalleled weapon!"<br/>
<br/>
This was the main reason Ning Zhuo found the stage surprisingly easy.<br/>
<br/>
In short, he had cheated again.<br/>
<br/>
The three sects' elders designed the trial for Qi Refining Stage cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, a Qi Refining Stage cultivator would only obtain a Qi Refining Stage level of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique and wouldn't have the ability to create a Foundation Establishment Stage Blood Path Diagram.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's existence exceeded the stage's design limits.<br/>
<br/>
With Yuan Dasheng's performance, Ning Zhuo easily cleared the second stage.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zhuo clearly intending to take Yuan Dasheng to the final stage, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit felt deeply worried.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh no, oh no!"<br/>
<br/>
"You can't do this, you can't take the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng in, it's too easy for it to get trapped and not come back." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew the final stage's mechanism and was extremely concerned for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo took Yuan Dasheng in and it got trapped, it would be a significant loss, and rescuing it would be difficult.<br/>
<br/>
On a normal day, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit would be eager for Ning Zhuo to make such a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
It wanted to see Ning Zhuo take a big fall.<br/>
<br/>
But now, if Ning Zhuo got into trouble and his strength was weakened, who would it rely on to deal with Ning Xiaohui?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui was only at the Qi Refining Stage, and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was more than enough to eliminate her.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew how useful the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was and didn't want such a valuable weapon to be lost.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, it was very worried that Ning Zhuo would act foolishly.<br/>
<br/>
If Yuan Dasheng got trapped in the final stage, he would spend too much time and effort trying to clear the stage and rescue Yuan Dasheng!<br/>
<br/>
"Master, Master." Seeing Ning Zhuo about to push the door open, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had no choice but to contact him again.<br/>
<br/>
"Stop, please stop, don't rush in." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit called out.<br/>
<br/>
Then, the next moment, a long whip of flame condensed above its head.<br/>
<br/>
Snap.<br/>
<br/>
With a crisp sound, the whip lashed the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: ...<br/>
<br/>
It never expected that one day, it would be whipped for reminding Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
It was whipped for Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
Where could it find justice?<br/>
