<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 221: For Ning Zhuo, I Got Whipped</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Hey, Ning Zhuo, what are you doing?" "At this critical moment, you're still exploring the Immortal Palace!" "Do you not understand the urgency of the situation?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been closely monitoring Ning Zhuo's every move, pacing anxiously in the main hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Hurry up and deal with Ning Xiaohui!" "If you keep dragging this out, she'll discover our secret!" "I'm so anxious, I'm practically on fire!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit growled, and indeed, a flame burst forth from its head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">When it became agitated or angry to a certain extent, parts of its body would ignite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">If the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit were Ning Zhuo, it would immediately use the Life Hanging by a Thread to deal with Ning Xiaohui! But now, Ning Zhuo was acting as if nothing was wrong, leisurely exploring the Lava Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">This drove the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit to the brink of madness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">It wanted to grab Ning Zhuo by the ear and loudly question himâ€”are you trying to get yourself killed by dawdling like this?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">However, it ultimately didn't dare to do so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In fact, it lacked the courage to speak to Ning Zhuo again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">It was very worried that it might accidentally reveal something, and Ning Zhuo would see through it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">While the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was anxious and hesitant, Ning Zhuo had already reached out to touch the door to the next room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">There was no reward for passing through the door, nor was there any blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This somewhat surprised Ning Zhuo: "No blood energy, how can I use the Blood Path Diagram?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The next moment, he and Yuan Dasheng officially stepped into the penultimate stage of the Demonic Gate path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Thousands of eyes, glowing with blood-red light, stared at them simultaneously!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo was astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He had never seen so many martial puppets before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Hundreds of puppets stood in an orderly fashion, all attracted by the commotion at the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This was an army of mechanical puppets!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Each puppet had eyes glowing red, or their bodies were shrouded in a layer of blood energy, exuding a Qi Refining Stage aura ranging from one to nine layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo's eyes also lit up: "So the blood energy provided by this stage isn't from the door, but from these puppets."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Seeing Ning Zhuo and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng appear, the mechanical puppets activated and charged at them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Hundreds of puppets moved together, like a tidal wave, bringing a strong sense of oppression to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Master, step back, I will protect you," Yuan Dasheng stepped forward, like a city gate, blocking Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Its body was solid, having undergone the Buddhist Gate path's enhancements, far surpassing its original state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Most importantly, it had been heavily repaired by Ning Xiaohui, looking brand new, with a bright red body and exposed golden bones, exuding a domineering and reliable aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The martial puppets that approached were all struck down by Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Yuan Dasheng's martial skills were superb, using both fists and feet, single-handedly defeating countless enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Bang, bang, bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Many martial puppets were struck by it, some were thrown far away, some were directly disassembled, and some were knocked into a group of their allies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">However, the number of martial puppets was overwhelming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Yuan Dasheng only had spiritual power, not blood energy, and was not in its best state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">It was concerned about Ning Zhuo's safety behind it, and facing the tidal wave of enemies, it could only retreat step by step.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo immediately cast spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Flames, frost, lightning, and wind blades descended, but they only triggered the blood energy defenses of the martial puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Each puppet was now covered in a blood muscle armor, significantly reducing the damage from the spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Damn," Ning Zhuo's heart sank, realizing that his spells had backfired, activating the puppets' stronger abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"Yuan Dasheng has been using only fists and feet, defeating many puppets without triggering their blood energy." "This stage might not encourage the use of spells at all. Pure martial skills might be the key to passing this stage," Ning Zhuo speculated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">However, martial skills were Ning Zhuo's weak point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">When he first reached the third stage, he was thoroughly taught a lesson by a martial puppet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">In the end, he had to rely on the Embrace Ice Technique to extricate himself and pass the stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo had always wanted to hone his martial skills, but he was too busy to find the time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo stopped using spells, and the demonic puppets also ceased using blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Yuan Dasheng was just one, and the numerous puppets surrounded them from all sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo had no choice but to engage in close combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">His basic martial skills were solid, allowing him to handle two or three puppets at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But now, he faced attacks from over a dozen puppets from all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Forced to constantly move, Ning Zhuo relied on guerrilla tactics to buy time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">As more and more demonic puppets surrounded him, the space for Ning Zhuo to maneuver and break through grew smaller, filling him with dread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Is this the end of my attempt to pass this stage?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo sensed impending defeat but was also puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He had passed the Buddhist Gate path and fully completed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Compared to the second stage of the Buddhist Gate, the difficulty of this Demonic Gate stage is hundreds of times greater!" "This is clearly unreasonable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">At this moment, a large group of mechanical puppets pounced on the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Each puppet emitted blood energy, forming blood muscles that reinforced their bodies and increased their strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">They piled on Yuan Dasheng like a mountain, pressing it down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Then, their blood muscle armors merged, forming a massive blood energy that sealed Yuan Dasheng entirely, creating enormous blood muscle shackles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Damn!" Ning Zhuo cursed inwardly, about to cast a spell to break the siege.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Just then, an unexpected change occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The blood muscle shackles on Yuan Dasheng lasted only a moment before turning back into blood energy, which was absorbed into Yuan Dasheng's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">To be precise, it was absorbed into the Blood Path Diagram within Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In an instant, Ning Zhuo understood!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"I get it, this is the correct way to pass the stage!" "The Blood Path Diagram is used like this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">When the Blood Path Diagram contains blood energy, it allows mechanical constructs to use the corresponding level of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">When it lacks blood energy, it can absorb demonic blood energy from the outside!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">These demonic puppets intended to imprison Yuan Dasheng, but instead, they delivered a great gift.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Previously, Yuan Dasheng had no blood energy to use, but now, with this substantial gift, its combat power surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">With a roar, Yuan Dasheng's muscles bulged, and blood energy surged, forming a blood-colored sphere that rapidly expanded outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The layers of mechanical puppets piled on it were all knocked away, crashing to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Many puppets couldn't withstand the intense blood energy shock and disintegrated mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Yuan Dasheng roared, clenching its fists like war hammers, swinging them like the wind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">It charged forward, unstoppable, with no mechanical puppet able to match it under the influence of the blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Many demonic puppets shattered under its fists and feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">However, the good times didn't last long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Yuan Dasheng's combat power gradually weakened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">There were too many enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Yuan Dasheng's attacks consumed blood energy rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Without sufficient blood energy, its combat power was significantly affected!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Enemies were everywhere, coming in an endless stream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo reminded Yuan Dasheng to continue absorbing blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Yuan Dasheng obeyed, grabbing a puppet's head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Blood Path Diagram activated, emitting a strong suction force, causing the puppet to tremble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Blood energy flowed from the puppet's body, through its head, along the arm, and into the Blood Path Diagram within Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Without blood energy, the puppet immediately weakened, becoming extremely fragile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Bang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Yuan Dasheng crushed the puppet's head with both hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Its attacks were often concentrated in its hands!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Yuan Dasheng continued to grab and crush, absorbing the puppets' blood energy and then destroying them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Although the demonic puppets were numerous, they lacked intelligence and couldn't counter Yuan Dasheng's actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">In contrast, Yuan Dasheng, having reached the Wisdom Spirit Stage, learned from the battle and began to focus on blood energy reserves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">It preferred to take hits rather than miss the chance to absorb the puppets' blood energy into its Blood Path Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The more blood energy Yuan Dasheng absorbed, the stronger it became, creating a positive feedback loop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Yuan Dasheng stabilized its position and became increasingly unstoppable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo felt gratified but also puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"With the correct method, this Demonic Gate stage becomes very simple. The real difficulty is much lower than the Buddhist Gate." "This is also unreasonable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo pondered deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Soon, a flash of insight struck him, and he considered a possibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He personally tested it in battle, choosing demonic puppets as opponents and experimenting multiple times, gaining a deep understanding of the stage's mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">It turned out that the Blood Path Diagram's absorption capacity had limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo's Blood Path Diagram was inscribed with the eighth layer of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, meaning it could absorb blood energy up to the eighth layer of the Qi Refining Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">It couldn't handle the ninth layer of blood energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">In fact, absorbing the eighth layer was already challenging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"The three sects' elders designed this stage to focus on the application of the Blood Path Diagram."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"In the early stage, use guerrilla tactics to delay time, extend the battle line, and choose lower-level puppets to absorb their blood energy." "In the mid-stage, use the absorbed blood energy to enhance combat power, eliminating puppets while sustaining oneself." "In the late stage, deal with the tougher opponents, fighting fiercely to carve a path through the blood and pass the stage!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Spells couldn't be used.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Using them would trigger many martial puppets to activate their blood muscles, significantly increasing their combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">This would not only increase the pressure on the cultivators but also drastically reduce the blood energy they could harvest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"So, the difficulty of this stage is related to the Blood Path Diagram."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"A Blood Path Diagram with the ninth layer of demonic technique has the lowest difficulty. The lower the level, the higher the difficulty!" "However..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"I have Yuan Dasheng, which was refined using the true scripture of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique. This allowed it to create a Foundation Establishment Stage Blood Path Diagram in the previous stage." "This diagram suppresses all demonic puppets in this stage, making it an unparalleled weapon!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">This was the main reason Ning Zhuo found the stage surprisingly easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">In short, he had cheated again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The three sects' elders designed the trial for Qi Refining Stage cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Normally, a Qi Refining Stage cultivator would only obtain a Qi Refining Stage level of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique and wouldn't have the ability to create a Foundation Establishment Stage Blood Path Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Yuan Dasheng's existence exceeded the stage's design limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">With Yuan Dasheng's performance, Ning Zhuo easily cleared the second stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Seeing Ning Zhuo clearly intending to take Yuan Dasheng to the final stage, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit felt deeply worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"Oh no, oh no!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"You can't do this, you can't take the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng in, it's too easy for it to get trapped and not come back." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew the final stage's mechanism and was extremely concerned for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">If Ning Zhuo took Yuan Dasheng in and it got trapped, it would be a significant loss, and rescuing it would be difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">On a normal day, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit would be eager for Ning Zhuo to make such a mistake.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">It wanted to see Ning Zhuo take a big fall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">But now, if Ning Zhuo got into trouble and his strength was weakened, who would it rely on to deal with Ning Xiaohui?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Ning Xiaohui was only at the Qi Refining Stage, and the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was more than enough to eliminate her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew how useful the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was and didn't want such a valuable weapon to be lost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">At the same time, it was very worried that Ning Zhuo would act foolishly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">If Yuan Dasheng got trapped in the final stage, he would spend too much time and effort trying to clear the stage and rescue Yuan Dasheng!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"Master, Master." Seeing Ning Zhuo about to push the door open, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had no choice but to contact him again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"Stop, please stop, don't rush in." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit called out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Then, the next moment, a long whip of flame condensed above its head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Snap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">With a crisp sound, the whip lashed the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">It never expected that one day, it would be whipped for reminding Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">It was whipped for Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Where could it find justice?</paragraph><br/><br/>
