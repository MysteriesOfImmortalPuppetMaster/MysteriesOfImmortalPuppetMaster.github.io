<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 775: Sudden Sense of Crisis</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The battle scene was incredibly intense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Situ Xing controlled sword lights that crisscrossed like meteors, displaying a posture as if he could charge seven times in and seven times out of an army of thousands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zhu Fenxiang, on the other hand, had a different fighting style. She occupied a corner of the martial arts arena, defending with rock-solid stability. At least two divine spirits orbited her; she attacked little and defended much, yet she still held the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo discerned the reason: "Situ Xing's combat method uses swords to lay down formations. This way, the formation is powerful, capable of modifying the battlefield and elevating his own combat power, while the sharp sword lights can inflict heavy damage or even slay enemy cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"Compared to him, Zhu Fenxiang's fighting style is much simpler and cruder."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"She only needs to summon divine spirit clones to assist in the battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Zhu Fenxiang has been preventing Situ Xing from laying down a larger sword formation. Therefore, relying on just one Golden Core-level divine spirit clone for offense is enough to cause severe interference."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"At the start of the battle, Situ Xing cast a sword formation that surrounded his body, elevating him to Golden Core combat power, but that wasn't enough to defeat Zhu Fenxiang. Only by laying out a stronger sword formation would that be possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Both sides are grappling over this point."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo paused slightly: "My grasp of the battle situation is clearer and more thorough. This must be the amplification from the true intent and principles of the Military Strategist. Very good, very good."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He suddenly thought of the point that "Situ Xing and Shen Xi do not get along."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He gained more understanding of this intelligence: "No wonder Situ Xing wants to suppress Shen Xi; it might be because Shen Xi is also skilled in formations, and specifically the Nine Palaces Formation, which requires the most calculation among the nine great static formations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Previously, when the two clashed, Shen Xi had actually defeated Situ Xing. Could it be because Shen Xi is stronger than Situ Xing in formations, making it difficult for him to set them up?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The three true intents brought an elevation to Ning Zhuo's realm, and this elevation would affect every aspect of Ning Zhuo's future cultivation and life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The improvement in his ability to spectate battles was just one small manifestation of this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Situ Xing and Zhu Fenxiang had fought several times before and knew each other inside out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The two sides went back and forth; one wanted to execute his sword formation tactics, while the other had few tactical requirements and was consistently trying her best to obstruct Situ Xing's calculations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">During the battle, the specks of sword light Situ Xing left on the battlefield were like stones placed in a game of Go. The more of these stones, the more advantageous it was for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Finally, by throwing out a new trump card, he managed to buy the critical time needed to successfully erect another powerful sword formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Zhu Fenxiang, accept defeat within my Universal Star Dipper Sword Formation!" Situ Xing shouted, his hands flying rapidly to form complex sword seals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Every seal his fingers precisely formed drew upon the power of the stars within the sword formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Consequently, the star swords multiplied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">One became two, two became four, four became eight... in the blink of an eye, three hundred and sixty-five star swords hovered densely around Situ Xing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The next moment, sword lights shot out, falling like a meteor shower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Zhu Fenxiang hurriedly mobilized her three divine spirits to fully guard her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">For a moment, the star swords showed their might, firmly suppressing Zhu Fenxiang and the three divine spirits into a disadvantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhu Fenxiang’s face remained calm; she did not panic in the face of danger. She took a miniature statue from her bosom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">She half-knelt on the ground, cupping her hands together, holding the miniature statue in her palms against her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, Abundant Earth is supreme! Eight Desolations and Six Harmonies, suppressing hell and bearing the heavens! Believer Fenxiang, using my blood, my bone, and my soul as a guide, kowtows to the Mysterious Dome! Respectfully inviting the Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Lord - may your Dharma body descend to the mortal realm!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">She called out in a high voice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In the next moment, Zhu Fenxiang's aura plummeted like a waterfall, and her entire being became incredibly weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Using her own foundation as the sacrificial material, she successfully drew the gaze of the Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Lord and brought down divine power, descending as a clone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">The statue in Zhu Fenxiang's hands burst forth with blinding divine light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The divine light shot into the sky, transforming into an earth-yellow pillar of light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">When the pillar dissipated, Zhu Fenxiang had vanished from her spot, replaced by a divine body standing three zhang tall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The god was draped in Black-Yellow Rock Armor, and dark golden leyline magma flowed slowly through the gaps in the armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Inside the heavy helmet, the revealed eyes were incomparably deep, steady as ancient mountains, capable of bearing all things and suppressing all evils!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">A majestic divine might, like the awakening of a primordial divine mountain, descended with a boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Great God - Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Lord!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Zhu Fenxiang was already protected within the body, safe and sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Situ Xing's expression changed drastically. The Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Lord merely stood inside the formation, yet he felt the operation of the Universal Star Dipper Sword Formation stagnate, as if a giant python had swallowed a small hill and was struggling to digest it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Prison-Suppressing True Lord launched an attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Boom, boom, boom...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Every strike erupted with a massive sound, whipping up earth-yellow shockwaves of dust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Universal Star Dipper Sword Formation operated with difficulty; the star power crisscrossing within the array shattered inch by inch like fragile spiderwebs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Sword gleams falling like meteors struck the Prison-Suppressing True Lord's body, only kicking up clouds of dust before disintegrating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Zhu Fenxiang's voice came from within the divine body: "Situ Xing, I specifically let you complete this grand formation so that I could crush you head-on! With this defeat, you will have no excuses!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Big! Big! Big!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Lord's divine body expanded, almost propping up the sky and pressing down on the earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Universal Star Dipper Sword Formation became increasingly difficult to operate, like a belly about to burst.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The True Lord extended a giant palm of black-yellow divine rock, grabbed the empty air, and pulled fiercely toward himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The next moment, the Universal Star Dipper Sword Formation seemed to have its spine removed; the grand formation collapsed, and star swords flew wildly in all directions, completely out of control.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The backlash of the formation slammed into Situ Xing's divine soul and physical body, causing him to feel as if he had been struck by lightning, and he wildly sprayed a large mouthful of fresh blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Specks of starlight were in the blood, mixed with many fragments of internal organs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Situ Xing's aura decayed to its lowest point in this instant, then suddenly erupted with an unwilling fighting spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Zhu Fenxiang, even if you can invite a Great God, don't think you can win easily!" he shouted. His entire person exploded into starlight, transforming into a human-shaped comet dragging a long tail of flames, charging toward the Great God's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Man and sword as one, pressing forward with indomitable will!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Even if the jade and stone burn together, he would not hesitate!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Under this intense and decisive battle intent, a conflict arose between the wills of Zhu Fenxiang and the Prison-Suppressing True Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zhu Fenxiang wanted to dodge, but the Prison-Suppressing True Lord felt it was an affront; being merely a clone, a loss was just a loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">If Zhu Fenxiang and the Prison-Suppressing True Lord were separate, it would have been fine, but the key was that they were united as one, fighting with combined strength. The contradiction in their wills immediately created a flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">This flaw was quite minute, but Situ Xing happened to be attacking with full force and caught it perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">At the critical moment, the Prison-Suppressing True Lord still raised a palm, but just as it emitted a phantom image of a black-yellow giant hand, it was pierced by Situ Xing's human-shaped comet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">A deafening explosion rang out! Blinding yellow light and star radiance mixed together and erupted violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The light dissipated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The phantom of the Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Lord dissipated unwillingly, leaving behind only specks of black-yellow light dust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhu Fenxiang was bathed in blood; her right arm suffered a comminuted fracture and hung down limply. The wound pierced all the way through to her right chest, nearly endangering her heart, with blood gushing out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhu Fenxiang's face was full of lingering fear. She glared at Situ Xing in shock and anger, only to find helplessly that although Situ Xing's aura was even weaker - on the verge of death, his life hanging by a thread - his life-saving jade token had already lit up, encasing him in an incredibly hard sphere of light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Having dealt with Situ Xing before, Zhu Fenxiang naturally knew how sturdy such a defense was. The killing intent that had surfaced in an instant could only be dispersed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Beside her, a miniature statue still floated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">It was the very treasure she had just used to summon the Wutu Prison-Suppressing True Lord. But now, the state of this treasure was quite strange; the earth-yellow radiance it emitted flowed constantly, its aura fluctuating between strong and weak, affecting the surrounding environment and forming a twisted black-yellow light shadow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The light shadow was still expanding continuously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Zhu Fenxiang's expression changed drastically. Not caring to declare victory over Situ Xing, she called directly to the Martial Arts Hall for help: "This is bad, the statue is undergoing Dao assimilation, send someone to handle it quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The Martial Arts Hall immediately mobilized formations to suppress it with full force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Zhu Fenxiang hurriedly moved away, her face full of apprehension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Fortunately, the Martial Arts Hall's formations were powerful enough. After a stalemate of several breaths, they successfully suppressed the Dao-assimilating statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">However, this martial arts arena could not be used for a short period.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The Dao assimilation was still ongoing; although it was suppressed and the situation was controlled, it needed time to cool down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Zhu Fenxiang had won, but the price was heavy - she had lost a precious statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">It was a pyrrhic victory!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo watched it once, then watched it a second time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He gained a profound understanding of the combat power and temperaments of Situ Xing and Zhu Fenxiang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Inevitably, his mood became somewhat heavy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"If I leverage my combat power, it would be stronger than what the two of them displayed in this battle!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">There was no doubt about this point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"But the key is, I leverage it through Military Strategist battle formations and the military tactic - Hero's Return Technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"On this point, I cannot use them within the Myriad Manifestations Sect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Although Ning Zhuo could borrow Qing Chi's troop types, the troop types were limited and he could not insert his mechanical units.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Losing this key leverage, Ning Zhuo would still feel considerable pressure dealing with Situ Xing or Zhu Fenxiang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Of course, if I use the Divine Ability: Life Hanging by a Thread or trump cards like the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, there is also a possibility of victory."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"But the price is too high!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"I cannot accept that in the short term."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">To some extent, once Life Hanging by a Thread or the Buddha Heart Demon Seal was exposed, Ning Zhuo would lose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Why lose a large portion of his future life for a duel in the martial arts arena?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">This was obviously not a worthwhile deal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"But I must prove myself in the martial arts arena!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"This is very necessary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Situ Xing leveraged Golden Core-level combat power through swordsmanship and formation arrangement. Zhu Fenxiang elevated her combat power to the Golden Core level through the Divine Summoning Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Foundation Establishment geniuses at this level can basically all leverage Golden Core combat power. I should also display such combat power to truly gain recognition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Otherwise, no matter how great my reputation is, it will ultimately be hollow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Without being tested in actual combat, it would not trigger complete recognition, and the public would maintain a certain degree of skepticism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo scrutinized his own combat power: "Excluding the Military Strategist aspect, my combat power mainly relies on Five Elements Techniques and Mechanism Art. I am outstanding in the Five Elements realm and can amplify spells to the Golden Core level using the Five Viscera Divine Spirit Art."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"But what I can truly rely on are the various mechanical constructs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Buddhist Doctor - Meng Yaoyin could not be deployed easily. Yuan Dasheng, Meng Yaoyin, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui, and Xue Shuyu Xie were the four conventional Golden Core-level combat forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"These are the things I can rely on."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Just like Zhu Fenxiang, who successively summoned four Golden Core-level divine spirit clones. One of them was even a Great God."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo decided to take advantage of his substantial increase in strength to try and solve the predicaments of Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Ning Zhuo first dissolved the blocks of ice wrapping Yuan Dasheng's body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">This surface layer of ice originated from Snow-Colored Maiden Hui's Innate Talent, providing continuous spiritual healing assistance to Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">However, the ice blocks inside Yuan Dasheng's body were what Ning Zhuo couldn't solve last time; they were filled with Yin-attribute power and principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">This time, simply using his five senses to observe, Ning Zhuo perceived many details that were difficult to detect before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Applying some mechanism arts, the results of his investigation were several times greater and much more profound than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Just as he had expected previously, the Yin-attribute spiritual energy was like maggots in the tarsal bones, causing severe corrosion to Yuan Dasheng's internal mechanisms and even his spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The mechanisms inside Yuan Dasheng had been corroded to a fragile state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"His mechanical body has suffered severe damage; it would be best to discard it directly. But there is huge trouble with the spirituality."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"The Yin-attribute spiritual energy has glued the spirituality and the mechanical body together, implicating each other."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"If I strip away the mechanical body directly, it will instead cause the Yin-attribute spiritual energy to retreat into the spirituality, causing Yuan Dasheng's spirituality to suffer even more severe damage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">To solve Yuan Dasheng's predicament, there were two main lines of thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">One was to resolve the Yin-attribute spiritual energy directly and head-on; the other was to add a mechanical body and use skillful force to make the Yin-attribute spiritual energy corrode the body more, performing a certain degree of transfer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"But regardless of which plan, I must find a way to strengthen the mechanical body first to help Yuan Dasheng's spirituality share more of the pressure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo's gaze went distant as he looked afar: "Yin-Yang Dual Polarity is even more fundamental and broad than the Five Elements. I should find related introductory trials to see if there is a possibility of breaking the deadlock."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo then looked at Meng Yehu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">After the ice blocks dissolved, sand and dust floated up from Meng Yehu's body, surrounding him and emitting a strong aura of divine power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo's expression immediately became a few degrees more serious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"This is bad."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Previously, the ice treated Meng Yehu, but unexpectedly, it made the seal of divine power on her stronger. What is the reason for this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo hurriedly investigated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The improvement in his Military Strategist attainments allowed him to feel the strict discipline within the sand and dust, filled with the unquestionable majesty of a god. Once the method was wrong and the god's majesty was offended, there would inevitably be a stronger backlash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Displaying his mechanism arts, Ning Zhuo immediately achieved a breakthrough he didn't have before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">His face changed abruptly as he determined that Meng Yehu's sphere of spirituality had already lost its luster, becoming heavy and sluggish, and even showing a certain degree of sandification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Greatly unfavorable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"The condition of Meng Yehu's spirituality is even more dangerous and terrible than Yuan Dasheng's."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"A few days later, he will be completely sandified, and his spirituality will be obliterated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The increase in his Artifact Refiner foundation allowed Ning Zhuo to grasp Meng Yehu's mechanical body relatively clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">The mechanical body actually didn't have much damage and had even shown a certain degree of improvement. The specific situation could be compared to stones turning into beautiful jade in the Gargle Jade Court.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ning Zhuo's heart sank to rock bottom. Compared to Yuan Dasheng, Meng Yehu's situation was truly precarious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">At this moment, he thoroughly realized the price of defeating the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">"How can I comprehend this kind of power of a god?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"I can't even solve a part of it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Any tentative intervention will almost certainly accelerate the sandification of the spirituality, or even invite devastating damage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">What to do?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">This problem needed to be solved urgently; it could not be dragged out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Relying on Ning Zhuo alone would not work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"I have to find a cultivator skilled in this area."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"Qingwu Langjun?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">When Ning Zhuo thought of this god, the figure of Zhu Fenxiang appeared before his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">"Qingwu Langjun is determined to go further on the path of the Martial God; can He solve Earth Element Divine Arts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"Moreover, He is not a cultivator but of Artifact Spirit origin; can He really understand by analogy?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">In comparison, Zhu Fenxiang was more likely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">"Even if Zhu Fenxiang can't do it, the Zhu Family is a well-known faction in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, skilled in Spirit Summoning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">"It's just that if I seek her out, my relationship with Situ Xing will undoubtedly become even more tense."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
