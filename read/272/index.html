<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 272: What? You Want Our Main Lineage to Curry Favor with Ning Zhuo?!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
This was a matter personally discussed by Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji, and had also gained the approval of the three Golden Core cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
This was the trend.<br/>
<br/>
In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the two powerful forces of the Southern Bean Kingdom made this decision to exclude the third party, the Void Sect!<br/>
<br/>
Under such circumstances, the upper echelons of the Ning family were merely mantises trying to stop a chariot.<br/>
<br/>
Without any Golden Core cultivators to lead them, they were just a gathering of Foundation Establishment elites.<br/>
<br/>
Faced with such a tremendous wave, they could only go with the flow rather than resist it.<br/>
<br/>
An elder broke the silence, "If only our main lineage had sent more cultivators to join the reformation team back then." Everyone's faces showed a hint of embarrassment, as if a boomerang had just hit them in the face.<br/>
<br/>
In hindsight, it was indeed the case.<br/>
<br/>
If the main lineage of the Ning family had made up most of the reformation team, or if the entire team had been from the main lineage, they would now be reaping great benefits!<br/>
<br/>
The academy elder said, "The decision back then wasn't wrong. After all, the future of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique was uncertain. In fact, even now, we've only uncovered the first to sixth layers of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique." <br/>
<br/>
The war hall elder added, "Who could have predicted the emergence of a prodigy like Ning Zhuo? Who could have foreseen that the Void Sect had been infiltrating and laying out plans for over a decade, forcing the royal family and the Meng family to join forces and make such concessions for future benefits?"<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch slowly spoke, his voice hoarse, "It seems that our Ning family main lineage must actively align with the Lava Immortal Palace. We must send as many cultivators as possible for reformation and then compete for positions within the Lava Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, if we let things develop as they are, the power of our main lineage will rapidly diminish and become unsustainable." After saying this, the Ning family patriarch couldn't help but show a strong sense of loss and fatigue.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he spoke, many elders in the hall immediately agreed.<br/>
<br/>
The war hall elder said, "As expected of the patriarch, this is a wise response! If that's the case, then I suggest we fully support Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
"If our Ning family main lineage wants to secure positions in the Lava Immortal Palace, this young man is the key figure."<br/>
<br/>
The talisman hall elder directly said, "I remember Ning Zhuo hasn't married or had children yet. He's only sixteen, which is a great age for an alliance with our main lineage."<br/>
<br/>
The academy elder stroked his beard and said, "From what I know of Ning Zhuo, he has a strong passion for cultivation, especially for mechanical arts. We can cater to his interests."<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch felt a moment of disorientation, as if he were in a dream.<br/>
<br/>
He never imagined there would come a day when he and the elders would discuss how to win over and curry favor with Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
His impression of Ning Zhuo was quite negative.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, it was because his son, the former young patriarch Ning Xiaoren, had been dethroned by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Ning Zhuo repeatedly showed disdain and resistance towards the Ning family's upper echelons and authority, which was an enormous affront to the Ning family patriarch.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family ancestor, Ning Jiufan, found Ning Zhuo's straightforwardness and charm endearing because Ning Jiufan, being in the Golden Core stage, didn't feel threatened by Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch, however, was in the Foundation Establishment stage, and Ning Zhuo's future advancement to the Foundation Establishment stage was already a certainty.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Ning Zhuo had established his own faction in the black market, which was a significant taboo for the Ning family patriarch, posing a great challenge and threat to his authority.<br/>
<br/>
But now, the situation forced the entire Ning family main lineage to fully support Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
The many elders who once supported and surrounded him all shared this thought.<br/>
<br/>
What made the Ning family patriarch feel cold was that even he knew: at this moment, it was very necessary to win over Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Despite his extreme dislike and hatred for Ning Zhuo, reason told him he had to win him over!<br/>
<br/>
He, the dignified patriarch of a family, had to bow and scrape to Ning Zhuo, a mere mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator, and greet him with a smile!<br/>
<br/>
Frustration!<br/>
<br/>
Annoyance!<br/>
<br/>
But what else could he do?<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, that kid, is too lucky. He rose to prominence with the Lava Immortal Palace! He's too adept at maneuvering, and now he's already a favorite in the eyes of the Golden Core cultivators!"<br/>
<br/>
Look!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji attended Zhu Hou's succession ceremony and directly brought Ning Zhuo along.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Xiaohui's death, the Ning family ancestor took Ning Zhuo under his wing, arranging a room for him in his own residence.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch once hoped Ning Xiaohui would receive such treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Reality was harsh‚ÄîNing Xiaohui had already sacrificed, yet it was Ning Zhuo who caught the attention of Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan, the Golden Core ancestors.<br/>
<br/>
From Ning Zhuo, the Ning family patriarch felt a threat, a huge, intense threat!<br/>
<br/>
It was clear that Ning Zhuo would be greatly nurtured!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had long become the face of the branch lineage, a person of great influence.<br/>
<br/>
He controlled the black market, had people at his disposal, and had prestige.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he had gained the recognition of the highest echelons, and his rise was unstoppable.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch, though at the prime of his life, felt exhausted in both body and mind as he sat in his seat.<br/>
<br/>
Facing the impact of this young junior, Ning Zhuo, he felt his own decline!<br/>
<br/>
He sensed a wave of the times rushing towards him.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, those cultivators who practiced the old techniques were part of the old era, while those who reformed with the three sects' superior techniques were stepping into a new era.<br/>
<br/>
The unchanged positions in the Lava Immortal Palace had completely altered the prospects of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Don't underestimate these respecialized Qi Refining cultivators; they may be weak now, but as long as they hold positions, they will have a continuous supply of resources, making future advancement to the Foundation Establishment stage highly possible.<br/>
<br/>
Such a force will grow stronger over time, eventually overshadowing the Ning family main lineage.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, as the leader of the reformation team, the face of the Ning family branch lineage, and the leader of the black market, was undoubtedly the most prominent figure of this era, and his gains would be the greatest.<br/>
<br/>
Considering that his mysterious talent had yet to be tested, Ning Zhuo's future prospects were incredibly bright and immeasurable.<br/>
<br/>
"The momentum is set, and in the short term, we can only go with the flow. But who can say what the future holds?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, geniuses often burn out early..."<br/>
<br/>
For the first time, the Ning family patriarch felt a murderous intent towards Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, when Ning Zhuo dethroned his son and established his own faction in the black market, the Ning family patriarch never thought of harming Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
But this time was different; Ning Zhuo threatened his position.<br/>
<br/>
The elders of the main lineage could curry favor with Ning Zhuo because they were just elders.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch currying favor with Ning Zhuo? To the point of making Ning Zhuo the future patriarch?<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch wasn't that foolish!<br/>
<br/>
"Let me in, let me in." Suddenly, there was a commotion outside.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch, in a bad mood, frowned and shouted, "Who's making noise outside!" Just as he finished speaking, the door to the council hall was forcefully pushed open from the outside.<br/>
<br/>
An old woman barged in.<br/>
<br/>
Her eyes were bloodshot, her body radiating anger and hatred, and her once-kind face was now extremely twisted with rage.<br/>
<br/>
This was none other than Ning Xiaohui's grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
After entering the hall, her gaze locked onto the Ning family patriarch, and she shouted, "Xiaohui, where is my granddaughter Xiaohui?"<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch's anger dissipated instantly, and he sighed, "It's come to this, please accept my condolences. Our Ning family will never forget Ning Xiaohui's sacrifice and contribution."<br/>
<br/>
"Don't talk to me about sacrifice and contribution!" Ning Xiaohui's grandmother raised her hand and shouted sharply, "I want Xiaohui, I want my granddaughter."<br/>
<br/>
"I don't believe it, I don't believe my granddaughter is dead."<br/>
<br/>
"This must be fake, it's all fake!"<br/>
<br/>
"My granddaughter is in the Lava Immortal Palace, she must be alive and well."<br/>
<br/>
"With so many Golden Core cultivators, how could they not protect a mere Qi Refining junior?"<br/>
<br/>
"Impossible, absolutely impossible."<br/>
<br/>
"My granddaughter Ning Xiaohui must have gained the favor of Lord Zhu Xuanji by now, hahaha..."<br/>
<br/>
Everyone was silent.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was in deep grief, her hair disheveled, her behavior bordering on madness.<br/>
<br/>
It was clear she couldn't bear the heavy blow.<br/>
<br/>
She had loved Ning Xiaohui dearly since her birth.<br/>
<br/>
She had raised Ning Xiaohui from a young age, and upon discovering Ning Xiaohui's talent for the Ice Jade Hand, she had poured all her efforts into nurturing her.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's death meant the collapse of the pillar of Ning Xiaohui's grandmother's life.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch sighed deeply, stood up, and walked to Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, patiently trying to console her.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, instead of being comforted, became even more frantic, shouting, "I won't listen, I won't listen, it's all fake, it's all fake!" She shouted as she ran out of the council hall.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch watched Ning Xiaohui's grandmother's retreating figure and sighed deeply again. He called for a subordinate and instructed them to give care to and keep a closer watch on Ning Xiaohui's grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
Having fully recognized the situation, the actions of the Ning family main lineage became more decisive and swift than before.<br/>
<br/>
They mobilized a large number of main lineage Qi Refining cultivators, forcing them to respecialize to the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Would this be too late?<br/>
<br/>
Everyone had such concerns, but no one voiced them‚Äîthis was something that had to be done!<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, any main lineage cultivators with sufficient mechanical arts skills who could enter the Immortal Palace were sent in, striving for positions with all their might.<br/>
<br/>
After issuing these orders, the Ning family patriarch went alone to the family prison.<br/>
<br/>
"My son." He once again saw Ning Xiaoren.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren was overjoyed and ran to the prison bars, "Father, why are you here? Has there been a turn of events? Has that brat Ning Zhuo stumbled? Has Ning Xiaohui suppressed him?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren harbored deep hatred for Ning Zhuo, and the monotonous, boring days in prison were driving him insane.<br/>
<br/>
Every bit of suffering he endured deepened his hatred for Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch sighed, "Ning Xiaohui is already dead, Ning Zhuo... let's not talk about him for now."<br/>
<br/>
"A major change has indeed arrived!"<br/>
<br/>
"I've thought it over and decided I can't let you waste time here. If you can secure a position in the Immortal Palace, it will be extremely beneficial for your future."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren asked, "What position in the Immortal Palace?"<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family patriarch replied, "You'll understand once you're out. I've come to inform you that the plan has been greatly advanced."<br/>
<br/>
"Next, you'll contribute talismans to exchange for your freedom."<br/>
<br/>
"Once you're out, you must do your utmost to carve out a future in the Lava Immortal Palace!"<br/>
<br/>
"You have enough mechanical arts skills to enter the Immortal Palace. Now, you must rely on yourself to fight this battle."<br/>
<br/>
"Afterwards, our main lineage will fully support and win over Ning Zhuo. Don't expect any support from me."<br/>
<br/>
"If you can gain Ning Zhuo's forgiveness, that would be even better. If you can curry favor with Ning Zhuo, that would be the best outcome!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren was shocked, his eyes wide with disbelief, "W-what? You want me to curry favor with Ning Zhuo? Are you really my father?"</div>
