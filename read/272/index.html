<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 272: What? You Want Our Main Lineage to Curry Favor with Ning Zhuo?!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">This was a matter personally discussed by Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji, and had also gained the approval of the three Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">This was the trend.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the two powerful forces of the Southern Bean Kingdom made this decision to exclude the third party, the Void Sect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Under such circumstances, the upper echelons of the Ning family were merely mantises trying to stop a chariot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Without any Golden Core cultivators to lead them, they were just a gathering of Foundation Establishment elites.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Faced with such a tremendous wave, they could only go with the flow rather than resist it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">An elder broke the silence, "If only our main lineage had sent more cultivators to join the reformation team back then." Everyone's faces showed a hint of embarrassment, as if a boomerang had just hit them in the face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In hindsight, it was indeed the case.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">If the main lineage of the Ning family had made up most of the reformation team, or if the entire team had been from the main lineage, they would now be reaping great benefits!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The academy elder said, "The decision back then wasn't wrong. After all, the future of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique was uncertain. In fact, even now, we've only uncovered the first to sixth layers of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The war hall elder added, "Who could have predicted the emergence of a prodigy like Ning Zhuo? Who could have foreseen that the Void Sect had been infiltrating and laying out plans for over a decade, forcing the royal family and the Meng family to join forces and make such concessions for future benefits?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Ning family patriarch slowly spoke, his voice hoarse, "It seems that our Ning family main lineage must actively align with the Lava Immortal Palace. We must send as many cultivators as possible for reformation and then compete for positions within the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Otherwise, if we let things develop as they are, the power of our main lineage will rapidly diminish and become unsustainable." After saying this, the Ning family patriarch couldn't help but show a strong sense of loss and fatigue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">As soon as he spoke, many elders in the hall immediately agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The war hall elder said, "As expected of the patriarch, this is a wise response! If that's the case, then I suggest we fully support Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"If our Ning family main lineage wants to secure positions in the Lava Immortal Palace, this young man is the key figure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The talisman hall elder directly said, "I remember Ning Zhuo hasn't married or had children yet. He's only sixteen, which is a great age for an alliance with our main lineage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The academy elder stroked his beard and said, "From what I know of Ning Zhuo, he has a strong passion for cultivation, especially for mechanical arts. We can cater to his interests."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Ning family patriarch felt a moment of disorientation, as if he were in a dream.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He never imagined there would come a day when he and the elders would discuss how to win over and curry favor with Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">His impression of Ning Zhuo was quite negative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">On one hand, it was because his son, the former young patriarch Ning Xiaoren, had been dethroned by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">On the other hand, Ning Zhuo repeatedly showed disdain and resistance towards the Ning family's upper echelons and authority, which was an enormous affront to the Ning family patriarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The Ning family ancestor, Ning Jiufan, found Ning Zhuo's straightforwardness and charm endearing because Ning Jiufan, being in the Golden Core stage, didn't feel threatened by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Ning family patriarch, however, was in the Foundation Establishment stage, and Ning Zhuo's future advancement to the Foundation Establishment stage was already a certainty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Moreover, Ning Zhuo had established his own faction in the black market, which was a significant taboo for the Ning family patriarch, posing a great challenge and threat to his authority.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">But now, the situation forced the entire Ning family main lineage to fully support Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The many elders who once supported and surrounded him all shared this thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">What made the Ning family patriarch feel cold was that even he knew: at this moment, it was very necessary to win over Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Despite his extreme dislike and hatred for Ning Zhuo, reason told him he had to win him over!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He, the dignified patriarch of a family, had to bow and scrape to Ning Zhuo, a mere mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator, and greet him with a smile!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Frustration!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Annoyance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But what else could he do?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Ning Zhuo, that kid, is too lucky. He rose to prominence with the Lava Immortal Palace! He's too adept at maneuvering, and now he's already a favorite in the eyes of the Golden Core cultivators!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Look!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhu Xuanji attended Zhu Hou's succession ceremony and directly brought Ning Zhuo along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">After Ning Xiaohui's death, the Ning family ancestor took Ning Zhuo under his wing, arranging a room for him in his own residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Ning family patriarch once hoped Ning Xiaohui would receive such treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Reality was harshâ€”Ning Xiaohui had already sacrificed, yet it was Ning Zhuo who caught the attention of Zhu Xuanji and Ning Jiufan, the Golden Core ancestors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">From Ning Zhuo, the Ning family patriarch felt a threat, a huge, intense threat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">It was clear that Ning Zhuo would be greatly nurtured!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo had long become the face of the branch lineage, a person of great influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He controlled the black market, had people at his disposal, and had prestige.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Now, he had gained the recognition of the highest echelons, and his rise was unstoppable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Ning family patriarch, though at the prime of his life, felt exhausted in both body and mind as he sat in his seat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Facing the impact of this young junior, Ning Zhuo, he felt his own decline!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He sensed a wave of the times rushing towards him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Clearly, those cultivators who practiced the old techniques were part of the old era, while those who reformed with the three sects' superior techniques were stepping into a new era.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The unchanged positions in the Lava Immortal Palace had completely altered the prospects of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Don't underestimate these respecialized Qi Refining cultivators; they may be weak now, but as long as they hold positions, they will have a continuous supply of resources, making future advancement to the Foundation Establishment stage highly possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Such a force will grow stronger over time, eventually overshadowing the Ning family main lineage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo, as the leader of the reformation team, the face of the Ning family branch lineage, and the leader of the black market, was undoubtedly the most prominent figure of this era, and his gains would be the greatest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Considering that his mysterious talent had yet to be tested, Ning Zhuo's future prospects were incredibly bright and immeasurable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"The momentum is set, and in the short term, we can only go with the flow. But who can say what the future holds?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Hmph, geniuses often burn out early..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">For the first time, the Ning family patriarch felt a murderous intent towards Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Previously, when Ning Zhuo dethroned his son and established his own faction in the black market, the Ning family patriarch never thought of harming Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">But this time was different; Ning Zhuo threatened his position.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The elders of the main lineage could curry favor with Ning Zhuo because they were just elders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Ning family patriarch currying favor with Ning Zhuo? To the point of making Ning Zhuo the future patriarch?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Ning family patriarch wasn't that foolish!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Let me in, let me in." Suddenly, there was a commotion outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Ning family patriarch, in a bad mood, frowned and shouted, "Who's making noise outside!" Just as he finished speaking, the door to the council hall was forcefully pushed open from the outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">An old woman barged in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Her eyes were bloodshot, her body radiating anger and hatred, and her once-kind face was now extremely twisted with rage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">This was none other than Ning Xiaohui's grandmother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After entering the hall, her gaze locked onto the Ning family patriarch, and she shouted, "Xiaohui, where is my granddaughter Xiaohui?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The Ning family patriarch's anger dissipated instantly, and he sighed, "It's come to this, please accept my condolences. Our Ning family will never forget Ning Xiaohui's sacrifice and contribution."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Don't talk to me about sacrifice and contribution!" Ning Xiaohui's grandmother raised her hand and shouted sharply, "I want Xiaohui, I want my granddaughter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"I don't believe it, I don't believe my granddaughter is dead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"This must be fake, it's all fake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"My granddaughter is in the Lava Immortal Palace, she must be alive and well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"With so many Golden Core cultivators, how could they not protect a mere Qi Refining junior?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Impossible, absolutely impossible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"My granddaughter Ning Xiaohui must have gained the favor of Lord Zhu Xuanji by now, hahaha..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Everyone was silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was in deep grief, her hair disheveled, her behavior bordering on madness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">It was clear she couldn't bear the heavy blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">She had loved Ning Xiaohui dearly since her birth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">She had raised Ning Xiaohui from a young age, and upon discovering Ning Xiaohui's talent for the Ice Jade Hand, she had poured all her efforts into nurturing her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Xiaohui's death meant the collapse of the pillar of Ning Xiaohui's grandmother's life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Ning family patriarch sighed deeply, stood up, and walked to Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, patiently trying to console her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, instead of being comforted, became even more frantic, shouting, "I won't listen, I won't listen, it's all fake, it's all fake!" She shouted as she ran out of the council hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The Ning family patriarch watched Ning Xiaohui's grandmother's retreating figure and sighed deeply again. He called for a subordinate and instructed them to give care to and keep a closer watch on Ning Xiaohui's grandmother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Having fully recognized the situation, the actions of the Ning family main lineage became more decisive and swift than before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">They mobilized a large number of main lineage Qi Refining cultivators, forcing them to respecialize to the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Would this be too late?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Everyone had such concerns, but no one voiced themâ€”this was something that had to be done!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">At the same time, any main lineage cultivators with sufficient mechanical arts skills who could enter the Immortal Palace were sent in, striving for positions with all their might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">After issuing these orders, the Ning family patriarch went alone to the family prison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"My son." He once again saw Ning Xiaoren.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Xiaoren was overjoyed and ran to the prison bars, "Father, why are you here? Has there been a turn of events? Has that brat Ning Zhuo stumbled? Has Ning Xiaohui suppressed him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Xiaoren harbored deep hatred for Ning Zhuo, and the monotonous, boring days in prison were driving him insane.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Every bit of suffering he endured deepened his hatred for Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The Ning family patriarch sighed, "Ning Xiaohui is already dead, Ning Zhuo... let's not talk about him for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"A major change has indeed arrived!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"I've thought it over and decided I can't let you waste time here. If you can secure a position in the Immortal Palace, it will be extremely beneficial for your future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Xiaoren asked, "What position in the Immortal Palace?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Ning family patriarch replied, "You'll understand once you're out. I've come to inform you that the plan has been greatly advanced."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Next, you'll contribute talismans to exchange for your freedom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Once you're out, you must do your utmost to carve out a future in the Lava Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"You have enough mechanical arts skills to enter the Immortal Palace. Now, you must rely on yourself to fight this battle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Afterwards, our main lineage will fully support and win over Ning Zhuo. Don't expect any support from me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"If you can gain Ning Zhuo's forgiveness, that would be even better. If you can curry favor with Ning Zhuo, that would be the best outcome!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Xiaoren was shocked, his eyes wide with disbelief, "W-what? You want me to curry favor with Ning Zhuo? Are you really my father?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
