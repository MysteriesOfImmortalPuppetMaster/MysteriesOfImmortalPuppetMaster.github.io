<paragraph index="1">Two Note Nation Frontline Main Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Camp of the Three Generals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Military Strategist’s Office.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Zhuo concentrated intently, his divine sense locked onto the jade slip in his hand, continuously observing the images within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This was the latest instance of Liu Er and the others using three mechanical constructs to harvest Ginseng Whiskers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“The performance of the Golden-scaled Chainsaw Snake almost perfectly met my expectations.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“The actual performance of the Rolling Electric Ball Cage was also good.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Only the Root-Drilling Hammer did not succeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“In every battle, this mechanical hammer was almost always broken. Only one instance survived, and that too was merely an accident.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo thought to himself, “How should I improve it in order to increase the survival probability of the Root-Drilling Hammer?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">To Shuangjing, the cost incurred by the Three Generals’ Camp was already pitifully low, but Ning Zhuo was not satisfied and still wanted to improve it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">In a sense, it was precisely his tireless pursuit of mechanical art that facilitated the continuous refinement of his craft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Sun Lingtong said, “This is easy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The three kinds of mechanical constructs produced by Ning Zhuo also attracted Sun Lingtong’s interest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Lately, he had also been delving into these things, finding them rather interesting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">When Ning Zhuo was pondering and refining the mechanical constructs, Sun Lingtong also joined in. In the past ten-plus years, such occurrences were not uncommon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Once, Sun Lingtong had wanted to retrieve his missing master, which was his greatest motivation for studying mechanical techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">But gradually, that motive changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Sun Lingtong was not devoted to mechanical techniques, merely interested; however, he knew that Ning Zhuo loved them from the bottom of his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He himself was also able to perceive the visible progress in his personal skills through this collaborative investigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sun Lingtong then suggested, “Little Zhuo, you could absolutely design a mechanical hammer and hand it over to any one of Liu, Guan, or Zhang cultivators.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“With their protection, the mechanical hammer would shoot more accurately and be safer, and it would never be smashed by the mad Ginseng Whiskers.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo let out an “ah” and stood dumbfounded right there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After a few breaths, he slapped his own forehead, “Right, how come I didn’t think of that? This method is the simplest and most convenient.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Boss, you’re still amazing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Amidst the mechanical marvels, Sun Lingtong, his face beaming with praise, laughed and said, “Little Zhuo, actually you are the orthodox one.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“I was only being lazy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Based on your direction, if a Drilling Hammer that could activate on its own and protect itself were designed, it would certainly be better.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“In this way, Liu, Guan, and Zhang would at least have one hand free, not having to undertake this task, giving them more room to exert themselves.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo shook his head, “Boss, although that may be so, the fact is that I had fallen into a cognitive pitfall.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">“I could never help but want to use mechanical techniques to solve every problem. I enjoyed the process, and I eagerly anticipated the wonderful sensation upon its successful realization.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“But regarding the actual problem, I may have thought too far ahead. Just as you are advising me now, it could be dealt with in this way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“This would save me a great deal of time and energy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“All mechanical techniques are merely means, with the primary purpose of solving practical problems.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“Although I enjoy this art, I must not forget my original purpose.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Thank you, Boss, for your guidance!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Deeply enlightened, Ning Zhuo sighed, “I often hear that when one reads too much, one becomes a bookworm. If I study mechanical art too rigidly, I fear I may become a mechanical art bookworm as well.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Sun Lingtong laughed heartily, “Little Zhuo, I was just speaking offhand, but it’s great that you found some inspiration.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“In the past, while staying in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, being well-read in poetry and books, and living a repressed life, it was indeed rather monotonous, miserable, and oppressive.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“Many people think that with your talent and insight, you should remain in one place, practice cultivation steadily, and only later, when you have achieved a certain level, travel around.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“But in my view, what do these outsiders know? It is most suitable for you to travel all over now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“You yourself might not realize it, but from my perspective, you have changed a lot along the way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and nodded slightly, “Indeed, that’s so.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand miles is truly the unparalleled method to broaden one’s experience.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“Along the way, I encountered all kinds of people. Even though books record details very thoroughly, they are never as vivid as in reality.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“On Cloud Concealment Mountain, I met the local Mountain God. At the Myriad Medicine Sect, I befriended a wine-loving confidant, truly experiencing that life can indeed become so pleasantly leisurely. In Thousand Peaks Forest, I met Liu Er, who had lofty ambitions; although he was in a lower position, he still persevered.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“And there was the Vanguard Camp.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“While taking part in the Iron Flow leveling the plains, I witnessed firsthand the bearing of the military. Even though I did not know them at all, I felt heartfelt admiration!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“So unafraid of sacrifice, facing death resolutely… that was yet another aspect of life’s demeanor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">At this point, Ning Zhuo slightly looked upward, his gaze as if piercing through the roof and casting toward the vast firmament, “How vast this world is. So many people live and cultivate in this world, each moving forward in their own way. Some harbor great ambitions, while others live leisurely and happily; there is no hierarchy among them —each displaying countless forms, each with its own beauty.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“Meeting and befriending these people, sometimes I felt inferior, sometimes envious, and sometimes I longed for them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“It was truly very interesting!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">At this, a slight curve appeared at the corner of Ning Zhuo’s mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Sun Lingtong laughed heartily, “Little Zhuo, I see that your mood has been much more carefree lately!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo scratched his head, “Yeah, Boss.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“We entered Thousand Peaks Forest just to seek my mother’s heirloom.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Therefore, we were pursued by Nascent Soul demon cultivators, barely escaping death. We joined the armies of Two Note Nation, scheming for a long time. We even played the role of the Old Stone Monster, taking risks on the battlefield.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Now, we have finally come to this point.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Du Tiechuan and the Ginseng Whiskerd Dragon King had fiercely battled once, each bearing injuries. They were also wary of the Old Stone Monster, this third-party Soul Formation level being, making it very difficult to unleash their full power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“At that moment, a stalemate ensued, with each army and every Nascent Soul-level and Golden Core-level powerhouse coming onto the stage, competing with one another.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“This is exactly the perfect opportunity for us to deal with the Six Caves Sect.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“Not only can we avenge our family, but also reclaim my mother’s heirloom. We have worked so hard for so long, and finally see hope.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“How could I not be happy?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong hummed in agreement, “Indeed, that’s so.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">With his eyes clear and bright, Ning Zhuo suddenly said, “At this very moment, I feel very happy!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Sun Lingtong: “Hmm?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo earnestly said, “I don’t envy the brotherly bond of Liu, Guan, and Zhang one bit, because I have you, Boss.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“I could travel all over and adventure with you, Boss, always feeling assured.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“This way of life is indeed much more interesting than that in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“I can, on one hand, witness all kinds of people and, on the other, continuously draw closer to my goal. You and I become stronger together, struggle together, and almost every so often, achieve new accomplishments.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Such days are truly wonderful! Boss, thank you!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Taken aback by Ning Zhuo’s words, Sun Lingtong’s eyes reddened slightly, his nostrils tinged with a slight sourness, and, gritting his teeth, he said, “Little Zhuo, you little fellow…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Taking a deep breath, Sun Lingtong then laughed out loud, “You stinky brat, don’t get satisfied so easily!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">“I’m still waiting for you to rescue your mother, so that the two of us brothers can seek out hidden secrets and be great thieves all over!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo hummed and nodded heavily, “I’ll accompany you, Boss!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong, hands on his hips, laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">At that moment, a soldier reported, bringing a letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">It was a letter from Shuangjing addressed exclusively to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">In the letter, Shuangjing invited Ning Zhuo to step out of the camp for a talk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong said, “This Shuangjing must have noticed that Liu Er has been monopolizing the top spot in recent days, and so he sought you out, Little Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“This guy has schemed against you many times; his aunt also once spoiled our good fortune in Green Forest Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“This is a good opportunity; we can have a good time teasing him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo shook his head indifferently, “There is no need for that.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">“That would be a waste of time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“I now wished I could split myself in two to get it done. I have too many tasks at hand.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“Teasing him, or even humiliating him, if it doesn’t create value, what use is it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Lingtong glared, “This is a great opportunity for you to regain your honor. Just imagine, making that arrogant guy eat humble pie and fawn over you —it would feel really satisfying!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo shook his head, “It’s just a matter of pride.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He and Sun Lingtong were of different natures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">For more than ten years, Ning Zhuo had always maintained a state of patience and forbearance. He had long become accustomed to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">It was precisely such life experiences that made Ning Zhuo very composed, with a wisdom far surpassing his age.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sun Lingtong pouted, “Little Zhuo, you’re not fun at all in this regard. When you’re alive, you should be indulging yourself a bit; otherwise, what is the point?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“Besides, I’m not just looking for amusement. If you don’t step forward and play along with Shuangjing, how can we stall for time?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“If you directly refuse Shuangjing like this, that kid will surely be seething with anger and will not give up easily.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, “Rest assured, Boss, I have already made arrangements.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">White Jade Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Hmph!” Shuangjing, furious, pounded the table and stood up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">He glared in the direction of the Three Generals’ Camp, “Not even deigning to reply to a single letter from me? Ning Zhuo, that little brat, is so full of pride. Fine, very good!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“Then don’t blame me for resorting to methods.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Shuangjing, making a prompt decision, left White Jade Camp and went to visit the quartermaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">He was of the Guo surname, of high status, and was soon led into a study to have a confidential discussion with the quartermaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Shuangjing, adding embellishments, informed the quartermaster of the relevant situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The quartermaster feigned understanding, “So that’s it. I was saying that this Liu Er, a mere Golden Core-level minor cultivator, monopolizing the top spot for days, was unexpected. It turns out there is such a secret behind it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Shuangjing immediately said, “Liu Er is nothing more than a person of mixed human and demon blood, with a narrow vision. With such a powerful weapon, he should have handed it over to the army for rapid dissemination. In this way, the time our army spends scavenging the battlefield would be greatly reduced, which would be very beneficial for the overall situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“But as it stands now, Liu Er, solely for his own personal gain, has placed our Two Note Nation behind him; if such thoughts and behavior are not corrected, causing the masses to frequently imitate, thereby undermining the fine ethos of the military, that would be very bad.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Shuangjing adopted an air of worry for the nation and its people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The quartermaster looked at him in astonishment, thinking: Liu Er was an outsider, a newly recruited one; that he could form a new army was already praiseworthy. To ask him to forsake his personal gains and think of the country would indeed be forcing his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He also muttered under his breath: All the soldiers of our main army are resting, and the time spent scavenging the spoils is precisely when the commanders can make use of it. Even if the time for cleaning up the battlefield is reduced, if the army still cannot be mobilized, then what good is it?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Even though Shuangjing did not have much experience in leading troops, it was obvious that he was speaking blatantly falsehoods; he must have ulterior motives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The quartermaster then squinted his eyes, “I wonder, Lord Shuangjing, what advice do you have to offer?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Shuangjing immediately clasped his hands and said, “How could I dare use the words ‘to impart wisdom’ when I am merely seeking your help, my lord? Please take action, for the sake of our great army and our Two Note Nation, to rectify such a bad atmosphere!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Saying that, he then handed over a storage bag to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The quartermaster took the storage bag, scanned its contents with his divine sense, and immediately a slight smile appeared on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“Good!” the quartermaster waved his hand, “Lord Shuangjing, what you say is reasonable. For the sake of our army and the grand cause of our nation’s ruler, we, as his subjects, shall each do our part and serve with all our might. Such a bad atmosphere should be nipped in the bud; that is best.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Shuangjing was overjoyed, and not at all surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">With his status, summoning the quartermaster to trouble a person of mixed human and demon blood —a minor cultivator who had just stepped into the officialdom of Two Note Nation —was not difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Immediately, Shuangjing stood up and said, “There is no better day than today; let my lord set out immediately to severely punish the Three Generals’ Camp!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The quartermaster said, “That’s right. Although Liu, Guan, and Zhang have merits, they ultimately lack refinement and proper discipline. This time, let me properly teach them what the way of being an official is.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Shuangjing then added, “The key figure in this matter is the military strategist of the Three Generals’ Camp, known as Ning Zhuo. It is he who designed and built the mechanical devices.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The quartermaster then asked, “Who is this person?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">After Shuangjing explained, the quartermaster was relieved, “A mere Foundation Establishment minor cultivator, and also a person from Southern Bean Nation, ha ha.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">“Let’s go!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">“Let’s set out immediately; Lord Shuangjing, please have someone accompany us as a witness.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Shuangjing hesitated immediately, “This…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">In the end, the quartermaster grabbed his arm forcefully and said, “We are going together, together!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Shuangjing, with no choice, had to comply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The quartermaster rallied a team of troops, and with fierce momentum, they arrived at the camp gate of the Three Generals’ Camp, but were blocked at the entrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Du Tiechuan ran his army strictly; the cost of violating military discipline was too high. The quartermaster dared not force his way in, so he ordered the soldiers of the Three Generals’ Camp to go quickly report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">The three generals —Liu, Guan, and Zhang —were training; upon hearing the commotion, they arranged their soldiers and immediately went to the camp gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">The quartermaster, a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, upon seeing the Three Generals come to pay respects while riding his horse, arrogantly waved his hand and said, “Where is your camp’s military strategist? Have him come forth quickly to pay his respects to me.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Liu Er immediately clasped his hands and said, “The military strategist is not in the camp; he is currently outside assessing the battlefield.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The quartermaster immediately turned his head and looked at Shuangjing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Shuangjing, cursing under his breath “old fox”, had no choice but to snort coldly and step forward, “Stop your nonsense —I dare say that Ning Zhuo is in the camp. This matter is of great importance; have him come immediately to be punished.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Liu Er was rather astonished, and immediately stated that his side had been working diligently, fighting to the death, and had never been slack in cleaning up the battlefield, with achievements clearly evident —what wrong had they done that warranted punishment?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The quartermaster bluntly stated, “You secretly possess a powerful weapon that can efficiently clean the battlefield and contribute to the overall situation, which should be submitted, yet for your own selfish gains, you place the great army and the nation behind you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">He further questioned, “Are you still the generals of Two Note Nation?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Before the Three Generals could retort, the quartermaster waved his hand, “People, come into the camp and bring that little military strategist over to me. He has too much nerve —not even coming to pay respects to me! Even if he is a foreigner, since he has joined our nation’s army, he should be subject to control.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">At his command, two Foundation Establishment cultivators immediately took orders and broke into the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Zhang Hei glared, “You dare?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">In the next moment, he directly took action, delivering two punches with a thumping sound, knocking the two Foundation Establishment soldiers down, who cried out in agony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Such a sudden turn of events left Shuangjing astonished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The quartermaster, in great anger, pointed his finger at Zhang Hei, “You black coal thief, how dare you be so rampant in front of me! If I have to personally deal with you, your punishment will be even greater.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“Bah!” Zhang Hei spat in the direction of the quartermaster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Shuangjing gasped, not expecting Zhang Hei to be so reckless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">“Oh dear,” Liu Er was greatly alarmed, opening his mouth to try to ease the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">But the quartermaster, enraged beyond measure, gave Liu Er no chance to smooth things over, and directly delivered a palm strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">A palm imprint appeared out of thin air and shot straight toward Zhang Hei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Liu Er shifted sideways, using his body to block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">“Pu.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">In the next moment, Zhang Hei was struck by the palm imprint and sent flying, spitting blood; after flying a considerable distance, he crashed to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">The quartermaster was startled and immediately sensed that things were not good.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Then he heard a piercing, shrill voice say, “Good, such great official might!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">The quartermaster quickly turned around to look, his heart leaping; in his panic he forced a smile, “Lord Zhao, you have actually come!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">The one who arrived was none other than Inspector Zhao Xi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Zhao Xi, very straightforward, directly waved his arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">“Smack.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Despite being a Nascent Soul-level cultivator, the quartermaster did not dare to shield himself in the slightest, and was forced to endure that slap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">He fell from his horse, his body staggering, nearly falling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">His cheeks quickly became red and swollen; his previous anger and arrogance had long completely vanished, replaced by fear and awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">“Smack!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">Another slap followed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">The quartermaster’s cheeks became symmetrically red and swollen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Inspector Zhao Xi pointed at the quartermaster and said, “Fortunately, I am here to supervise the army; otherwise, I would never have discovered a person like you —so willfully self-serving, exploiting public office for personal gain!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">“My lord, Lord Zhao, please allow me to explain.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">“Shut your mouth; you have no part in speaking here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">“If you speak, your crime will be compounded!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">The quartermaster, in a panic, abruptly turned his head and looked at Shuangjing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="335">Zhao Xi also squinted his eyes and looked at Shuangjing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="337">Shuangjing’s face turned pale, unable to hide his panic; he quickly dismounted and bowed his head in greeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="339">The quartermaster glared, staring fixedly at Shuangjing, his eyes filled with a mixture of anger and hatred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="341">Zhao Xi, meanwhile, squinted his eyes, snorted coldly, and waved his sleeve, signaling Shuangjing to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="343">Shuangjing took a deep breath, his steps seeming slow yet actually fast, and quickly left this place of disputes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
