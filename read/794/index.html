<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Bluestone Grotto-mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Tea smoke curled in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Zhu Guizhi sat cross-legged, her bluish-purple skirt spreading across the prayer mat like flowing water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The two had been conversing for some time now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Zhu Guizhi’s mood, however, was not particularly good.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Her main purpose in visiting Ning Zhuo so quietly this time was to probe him. Yet, after several rounds of conversation, she had failed to pry any valuable intelligence from his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zhu Guizhi had long since made arrangements for her daughter Zhu Fenxiang’s marriage. She did not want Zhu Fenxiang and Ning Zhuo to end up together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">However, Ning Zhuo had displayed his own Innate Talent, and his actions hinted at the formidable power of the faction backing him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Before coming here, Zhu Guizhi had meticulously studied Ning Zhuo’s performance during the trials in the Profound Armor Cave, as well as his battle with Gu Qing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The more she studied, the more she didn't dare to be careless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">She worried that her actions might provoke Ning Zhuo and sour relations with a Super Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">As a mature Righteous Path cultivator, Zhu Guizhi naturally would not commit such a foolish act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">But the initial results of their negotiation showed Ning Zhuo to be quite impenetrable, leaving Zhu Guizhi with no certainty. She was even somewhat annoyed, almost wondering if Ning Zhuo was an old cultivator who had reincarnated or performed a soul-possession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">She shook her head inwardly; she knew very well that Ning Zhuo was a young man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He lacked any air of decay; his clear eyes alone radiated the beauty of youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhu Guizhi raised her hand to pour tea, the green jade bracelet on her wrist lightly clinking against the porcelain cup with a crisp, clear sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">She would not give up easily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In the next moment, she took the initiative to change the subject, mentioning the previous battle and praising Ning Zhuo’s rhetoric when he publicly framed Gu Qing after the fight ended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"A casual remark from Young Master Ning Zhuo threw Gu Qing into immense trouble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"However, I am somewhat puzzled."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"With the Young Master's intelligence, wouldn't befriending Gu Qing be better than making an enemy of him?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Hearing this, Ning Zhuo’s lips curled slightly, but he did not answer. He merely leaned back - a simple gesture that immediately created an extraordinary presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Madam Zhu, don't you think the sparring between painted avatars proposed by Gu Qing was too tepid and boring?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">In an instant, Zhu Guizhi keenly sensed a sharp light flashing in Ning Zhuo’s eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">It was like a sudden bolt of lightning amidst the clouds; though it lasted only a moment, it made Zhu Guizhi’s heart skip a beat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Young Master Ning is indeed no ordinary person." Zhu Guizhi lowered her eyes and smiled faintly, though her hands tucked in her sleeves involuntarily tightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">She thought of her husband, He Yong - that eternally mild and polite Righteous Path cultivator. In his entire life, he would likely never be so unrestrained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">This lack of restraint was, in fact, the spark of ambition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This trait displayed by Ning Zhuo added a great deal of admiration to Zhu Guizhi's view of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">It was something her husband, He Yong, lacked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">From this perspective alone, her daughter’s judgment was superior to her own. However, Ning Zhuo displaying only this was far from enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Since she hadn't probed the true result, she had to remain skeptical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">As a mature person of the Righteous Path, she also needed to be responsible for her subordinates and her faction; she needed a concrete fact. Then, based on that fact, she would make judgments, choices, and changes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"Young Master Ning Zhuo, why not take a look at this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zhu Guizhi took out a gift list and informed Ning Zhuo of the relevant Zhu family policy: the Divine Summoning Art taught by Zhu Fenxiang meant that he, Ning Zhuo, would have to become a matrilocal son-in-law and join the Zhu family. This matter was already circulating within the Zhu family. The various precious materials, Magic Artifacts, and magic treasures on the gift list were part of the resources for marrying in, with more to come in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo didn't even glance at the gift list, immediately waving it away. He stated that he had already learned of this from Zhu Fenxiang. But it was a misunderstanding! There was no secret romance between him and Zhu Fenxiang; it was merely a coincidence that Zhu Fenxiang had taken the initiative to teach him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhu Guizhi was not particularly surprised by this answer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">An excellent politician usually has suspicions, or even the answer, before asking many questions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Her asking this question was merely a setup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">She sighed softly: "When a young woman's heart first awakens, it is easy for her eyes to be clouded by temporary emotions. I remember when I first met her father; it was the same."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Fenxiang is my own flesh and blood. If she did something that affected her whole life out of a momentary impulse... that is possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"Hearing the Young Master's answer now, I can breathe a sigh of relief."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Zhu Guizhi’s concern did not match the image of Zhu Fenxiang in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo had already collected much intelligence on Zhu Fenxiang, and he did not believe she was someone who would let emotions ruin things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Zhu Fenxiang had received elite training since childhood, putting in hard work and patience, tempering her mind and nature. She deeply understood human and divine nature, which allowed her to serve the gods, manage relationships well, and achieve results in the Divine Summoning Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">This was precisely what Ning Zhuo admired about Zhu Fenxiang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo was indifferent in his heart, but on the surface, he expressed admiration: Zhu Guizhi was acting as a mother, planning for her child. Such benevolence was moving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">As he spoke, a gentle expression appeared on his face as he couldn't help but think of his own mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo: "Since the misunderstanding is resolved, please take back this gift list, Madam."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"It's just a misunderstanding; it’s better not to deepen it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Zhu Guizhi sighed, praising Ning Zhuo’s upright character as admirable. He was indeed someone who had passed the Three Questions of the Heart. He walked a straight path and sat tall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Her tone shifted slightly, "However, the Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art is, after all, no small matter. Fenxiang’s current situation..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After listening, Ning Zhuo’s brow furrowed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He asked Zhu Guizhi how she intended to handle it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhu Guizhi then threw out a solution: first, use a Divine Art to erase part of Ning Zhuo’s memory. Afterward, have Ning Zhuo publicly announce that he and Zhu Fenxiang were friends, not lovers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Zhu Guizhi observed his expression and added at the end: "Please rest assured, Young Master Ning. A Divine Contract will be signed beforehand to ensure safety throughout the process."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo’s frown deepened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ensure what safety? Could a Divine Contract truly ensure his safety?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">What if the Zhu family had malicious intentions?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A Divine Contract was not one hundred percent reliable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">As a contract, there were bound to be loopholes to exploit. There was absolutely no need for him to take this risk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo’s nature dictated that he would not easily take such a gamble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">He was proficient in soul-searching and had recently frequently used the Burning Boat Soul-Ferrying Art. He knew all too well that the room for manipulation in such things was actually massive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Once he agreed, his situation would be like fish on a chopping block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">If he encountered someone with ill intent, Ning Zhuo would surely pay a heavy price, perhaps even falling into a bottomless abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">This was not the act of a wise man!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Furthermore, he did not want to publicly announce their relationship.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">An official announcement would only arouse more suspicion. It would be a significant blow to his Righteous Path reputation. Simultaneously, it would signal to the public that his relationship with the Zhu family was average or even negative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This would also have an adverse effect on his current situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">He was currently facing the issue with Gu Qing. If he revealed such a flaw now, Gu Qing’s group would surely pounce, seizing the opportunity to strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The pressure he faced from Gu Qing and Zhao Hansheng was already quite high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo was inherently in a weaker position. His previous framing of Gu Qing was a matter of using the opponent's strength against them and riding the momentum. Ultimately, he had only taken advantage of a sneak attack to catch Gu Qing off guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo absolutely did not accept the handling method proposed by Zhu Guizhi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and immediately stated that he was quite interested in the Zhu family's Divine Summoning Art and wished to learn it. Furthermore, the version he held was only the basic first level. Since the Zhu family could bring this up, it meant the matter was negotiable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo: "Madam Zhu, what do you think of these?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">As he spoke, Ning Zhuo took out a handful of Ghost Path Golden Cores from his storage bag.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The Golden Cores spilled onto the table, spreading out. For a moment, golden light flickered alongside a dense ghostly aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zhu Guizhi’s expression changed slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">She was a Golden Core-level cultivator herself and immediately sensed Ning Zhuo’s dominance from this single action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo: "If that’s not enough, there are more here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo pulled out two more handfuls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Over a dozen Ghost Path Golden Cores were spread across the table, making the entire room glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Zhu Guizhi’s breath hitched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Such immense wealth held in the hands of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Moreover, the young man before her was only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This forced her to re-evaluate Ning Zhuo’s strength and his status within his faction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The value of these dozen or so Ghost Path Golden Cores far exceeded the gift list Zhu Guizhi had presented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The strength she had tried to demonstrate with her list now seemed fragile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo’s shocking financial power also caused many thoughts to swirl in Zhu Guizhi’s mind. For a moment, her throat felt dry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Zhu Guizhi had arranged the marriage for Zhu Fenxiang solely to fully utilize her value and gain the maximum political benefit. Now, she saw another possibility in Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">As long as Zhu Guizhi confirmed that a union between Zhu Fenxiang and Ning Zhuo would bring her more political profit, then why not? Changing the original plan was not impossible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Zhu Guizhi pondered for a moment, then suddenly smiled: "The Young Master's generosity makes me unsure of what to do. Could it be... these Golden Cores are a betrothal gift?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">She covered her lips with her sleeve, her eyes shimmering with a probing light: "Hehehe, but if we are to arrange a marriage, the elders of both sides must meet and discuss in detail."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">She naturally followed up: "I still don't know much about the Young Master’s family situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The smile on Ning Zhuo’s face gradually faded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Zhu Guizhi still didn't want to give up, but Ning Zhuo could not tell her the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Ning Clan was not powerful. If Ning Zhuo spoke the truth, the outcome would not be good.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">But he wouldn't deliberately lie either, because such a lie would be too easy to expose. If it were verified later, what would happen to his image and reputation?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The best situation was actually the current one. The public subconsciously believed that Ning Zhuo’s background was very extraordinary. This was almost a consensus.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">How should he handle this?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo had been evasive and perfunctory many times before; if he tried the same trick again, it would show weakness and suggest he was feeling guilty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">In just an instant, Ning Zhuo came up with a countermeasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"Madam Zhu." He smiled slightly, showing a clear sense of arrogance, "Regarding the Divine Summoning Art, your daughter personally told me it wasn't a major issue. Only then did I accept it, and it was only the first level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Yet you come here now with a different story. You may have the love of a mother for her child, but what does that have to do with me? You've come to trouble me and place me in danger."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"And you persistently probe into my family background. Are you trying to confirm something?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"If my background weren't high, would you have resorted to other schemes against me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Zhu Guizhi’s expression shifted instantly, and she opened her mouth to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo reached out to stop her and continued: "During this trial, I intentionally concealed my background to give myself an advantage."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"If you wish to know, it is not impossible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"But at least..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Zhu Guizhi felt a sense of relief and smiled: "I am willing to pay the price for such precious intelligence."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Ning Zhuo chuckled: "Madam, you underestimate me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"If you want to know, first see if you have the qualifications."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"As for Golden Cores ..." Ning Zhuo glanced down at the dozen or so Ghost Path Golden Cores on the table, "I have cut down quite a few of them myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Zhu Guizhi’s pupils constricted violently. Her expression stiffened, her previous composure vanishing as she felt a strong sense of offense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo’s words were quite blunt, but they were actually very logical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Everything had to be decided by strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Strength was the greatest logic!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The fundamental logic of how the world operated had never changed since ancient times - the winner is king!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">No matter the opinion, conflict, or contradiction, if both sides started cutting each other down, the one who died was definitely the one in the wrong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Once you are victorious, there will naturally be Renowned Masters to interpret the classics in your favor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The logic held, but Zhu Guizhi still felt a wave of humiliation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">She was, after all, Zhu Fenxiang’s mother and an elder. Besides that, she was a Golden Core-level cultivator. By cultivation rank, she was Ning Zhuo’s senior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo lacked basic respect for her!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Zhu Guizhi suppressed her anger, stating that she did not wish to bully the young as an elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo chuckled: "Madam Zhu, you’ve been probing my background repeatedly; you were already bullying the young."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">His sharp words left Zhu Guizhi speechless for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo’s voice was clear: "The Zhu family’s name is like thunder in my ears."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">"The Divine Summoning Art displayed by Fellow Daoist Zhu Fenxiang in her battle against Situ Xing was indeed exquisite. Her extraordinary grace was truly captivating."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">"I am untalented, but watching that battle made my hands itch for a fight. Seeing the Madam today, I feel it even more."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"As the saying goes, a tiger daughter comes from a dragon mother. I ask Madam Zhu to please grant me your guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Seeing Ning Zhuo pressing her repeatedly, Zhu Guizhi was so angry she laughed. It seemed this young junior before her had mistaken her for an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Since Young Master Ning insists, very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"I accept this challenge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Zhu Guizhi had secretly made up her mind. She had to take this fight seriously and give Ning Zhuo a proper lesson to solidify her status as a senior and establish the hierarchy between them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
