<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 163: Great Rewards for Ning Zhuo</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Ze's Residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">After breakfast, Ning Zhuo arrived in the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others were already there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">When the classmates saw Ning Zhuo, they all stood up and saluted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Yong, with dark circles under his eyes, joyfully exclaimed, "Brother Zhuo, I couldn't sleep at all last night! Too excited, hahaha." Others echoed, laughing along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo cupped his hands in thanks once more, exchanged a few pleasantries, and then said to the person behind him, "Cousin, just find a place to sit." "Today, we will continue to discuss our experiences in spellcasting. Although you haven't practiced the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, listening more can still be beneficial." Ning Ji, looking embarrassed, nodded repeatedly, "Alright, alright. I'll follow your arrangements!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">His father, Ning Ze, had called him into the study early in the morning and sternly instructed him to fully rely on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Ji dared not disobey his father's orders, so during breakfast, he "proactively" requested to follow Ning Zhuo, even expressing a desire to leave the Talisman Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo did not directly accept his request but suggested that Ning Ji stay in the Talisman Hall while also participating in their discussions and exchanges on spellcasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo's response did not completely satisfy Ning Ze, but it did not entirely disappoint him either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Ji mingled with the crowd, greeting others briefly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He was originally a classmate of Ning Zhuo, and the members of the reformation team were all familiar faces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Ji intended to sit closest to Ning Zhuo, but at that moment, Ning Chen suddenly spoke up, "That's my seat. What are you doing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Ning Ji exclaimed, "Isn't it free seating?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Chen sneered, "Seats have their own rules. At the very least, you should understand the principle of first come, first served. You arrived last, so you should sit at the back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Ji retorted, "You, Ning Chen! How arrogant. Don't forget, this courtyard belongs to my family. I'm the host, and you're the guest. How can a guest bully the host?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Chen laughed heartily, pointing at Ning Ji, "Do you think we care about this shabby courtyard? We're here because Brother Zhuo is staying here. Believe it or not, if Brother Zhuo moves to any other courtyard, we'll follow him there?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Unable to out-argue Ning Chen, Ning Ji turned to Ning Zhuo, "Cousin, look at this..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, "Today, we are discussing spells, exchanging and learning from each other, just like in a school." "In school, we don't talk about cousins; we're all classmates." "Ning Ji, you can sit at the back. It won't affect your learning."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Ji's face turned a bit red with embarrassment and anger, and he gritted his teeth, "Since my father told me to follow you, I'll listen to you." Ning Ji sat at the outermost, farthest place from the group.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Closest to Ning Zhuo were still Ning Chen and Ning Yong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Seeing this scene, everyone had their own thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"The day before yesterday, we discussed the Embrace Ice Technique. Today, I want to talk about the combination of the Embrace Ice Technique and the Qi Breath Technique." "If there's anything I miss or get wrong, please feel free to correct me." Ning Zhuo began his lecture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Everyone listened attentively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Initially, many of them didn't care, thinking Ning Zhuo was just lucky to find a technique that suited him, the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">But after Ning Zhuo actively shared his spellcasting experiences, they all changed their minds, recognizing that Ning Zhuo was indeed a talented individual with extraordinary insights into spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo humbly called it an exchange and discussion, but Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others knew well that Ning Zhuo was imparting his precious spellcasting experiences to them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo, who had early wisdom, benefited from his mother's will and Sun Lingtong's education, always hid his strength in school.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Later, through the rewards from the Lava Immortal Palace's ranking, his spellcasting experience skyrocketed, making him more than capable of guiding these classmates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Among the crowd, the least attentive was Ning Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Ji felt indignant, thinking that his first time following Ning Zhuo had resulted in unfair treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"I'm your cousin, yet you help outsiders instead of me!" "What are you even talking about?" "I haven't even learned the Embrace Ice Technique or the Qi Breath Technique!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo sensed Ning Ji's resentment, but the latter was not focused on the exchange and learning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo did not point it out, letting Ning Ji stew in his emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">It wasn't until the family envoy arrived that Ning Zhuo interrupted the exchange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The envoy said, "Ning Zhuo, the former young clan leader Ning Xiaoren has been imprisoned. I bring you your deserved rewards." "A Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact, a bottle of Three Apertures Exquisite Heart Pills, three bottles of Condensing Qi Pills, a bottle of Marrow Cleansing Pills, and a bottle of Detoxification Pills." The envoy recited the list and handed the storage bag to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Please check and confirm."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo opened the storage bag, checked it, and nodded slightly, asking, "There's no Enlightenment Diagram or Ice King Wine. May I ask why?" "Yes, Brother Zhuo reached the eighth level. He was still in the reformation team at the time, and according to the rules, he should have received the opportunity to comprehend the Enlightenment Diagram and the Ice Jade Wine!" Ning Yong was the first to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Other classmates also spoke up, supporting him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The envoy's face changed slightly, and he quickly waved his hand, "Everyone, please calm down. I'm just the first wave." "Since yesterday, the family elders have been discussing giving Ning Zhuo more compensation." "These rewards are just part of it, the ones that could be prepared first and sent by me." "There will be other envoys after me." Hearing this, everyone calmed down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"I see, I misunderstood the envoy." Ning Zhuo smiled, inviting the envoy to rest inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The envoy declined, leaving after the handover.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo tied the storage bag to his waist and continued to impart spellcasting experiences and techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">About half an hour later, the second envoy arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"A Five Elements Ruler Magical Artifact, a Calm Heart Bell Magical Artifact, a bottle of Enlightenment Pills, a stack of Qi Boosting Talismans, and six Harmony Talismans." The envoy announced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo checked the storage bag, confirming the contents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He couldn't help but feel something.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The envoy, seeing Ning Zhuo not asking questions, took the initiative to explain, "Brother Ning Zhuo, are you anxious? The Ice Jade Wine will be delivered. However, this type of wine needs to be stored in an Ice Heart Jade Pot to maintain its quality. And the Ice Heart Jade Pot is a treasured item of our clan, always with the ancestor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Therefore, to get a portion of the wine, one must meet the ancestor, who will personally bestow it, and then the clan leader will pass it on." Ning Zhuo smiled, "I'm not in a hurry. Envoy, you must be tired. Why not rest inside?" The envoy waved his hand, "No, no, I have other matters to attend to."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo said, "It's too much trouble for the envoy to deliver multiple times. Why not let the main branch prepare everything and notify me? I'll go and collect it all at once." The second envoy shook his head slightly, "I just follow orders." Ning Zhuo didn't let it go easily, "Then please convey my thoughts to them." "Alright." The second envoy also left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo walked back from the courtyard gate, hearing his classmates excitedly discussing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"Didn't expect the family elders to be so generous this time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"These are all good things. Even Ning Xiaohui never received such treatment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"This is because Brother Zhuo gave them a profound lesson, making the elders understand what to do!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Hahaha, indeed! Even the young clan leader was brought down by Brother Zhuo. Who dares to mistreat Brother Zhuo now? Afraid of being brought down too?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Yong muttered, "Why is delivering rewards so troublesome? Back and forth, why not send everything at once?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Chen squinted his eyes, "Perhaps someone among the family elders wants to show everyone that they are not mistreating Brother Zhuo anymore."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Since Ning Yong started calling Ning Zhuo "Brother Zhuo," the nickname gradually spread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Especially after yesterday's events, all classmates changed their address, only calling him "Brother Zhuo," and no one called Ning Zhuo by his name anymore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">On the third visit, the envoy finally brought the Ice Jade Wine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Two taels of Ice Jade Wine, a Profound Ice Waist Token, two Enlightenment Diagrams of Ling Frost and Proud Snow, three stacks of Ice Light Strong Vein Talismans, a bottle of White Snow Spring Pills, and ten top-grade spirit stones!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After announcing, the envoy reminded Ning Zhuo that the Ice Jade Wine couldn't be stored for long and needed to be consumed quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Ling Frost and Proud Snow diagrams were masterpieces containing profound principles, not Ning Zhuo's property, and were only lent to him temporarily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After the time limit, Ning Zhuo must return them to the family treasury.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The envoy was about to leave when Ning Zhuo stopped him, frowning, "These rewards are many, far exceeding what I deserve. I cannot accept them all without merit. I will only take what I should, and the rest should be returned to the family treasury."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The envoy was prepared and replied, "These are not just rewards but also compensation from the elders."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Ning Xiaoren, as the young clan leader, was indeed unqualified. Brother Ning Zhuo, your achievements in exploring the Immortal Palace are significant. These are to appease you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"The higher-ups mean it this way."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"Once these things are given to you, they are yours. How you use them is up to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Farewell."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The envoy left.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Ji finally couldn't hold back, standing up and calling out, "Cousin, you have so many cultivation resources. How can you use them all by yourself?" "Look, I helped in the ancestral hall yesterday too."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Why not lend me those two Enlightenment Diagrams, or the Tornado Windmill, or even the Calm Heart Bell?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo quickly glanced at the others, noticing that many of them were also tempted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">The family elders had given too much, and these classmates, being sixteen or seventeen years old, had never seen such generosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Ji voiced what many were thinking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"You see."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Yesterday, we all helped, creating a sensation that shook the entire clan, bringing down Ning Xiaoren and giving you such rich rewards." "Other pills are consumables, and we wouldn't feel right asking for them." "But these Magical Artifacts are excellent for assisting in cultivation. With our relationship, lending them should be fine, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Under the hopeful gazes of everyone, Ning Zhuo's faint smile disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">He shook his head expressionlessly, "Cultivation treasures are personal items and cannot be lent out casually. Don't bring this up again!" "Alright, the family's rewards are finally distributed." "Let's continue."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo returned to his original position and resumed teaching spellcasting techniques and insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Stingy, so stingy!" Ning Ji, directly and ruthlessly rejected by Ning Zhuo, was further agitated by the rich rewards, and his jealousy quickly turned to resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Some classmates also felt uneasy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">But most quickly adjusted their mindset, focusing on the lecture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo, without showing any emotion, silently noted everyone's reactions.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
