<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Meng Chong defeated Zhou Nongying?!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Book Master had been momentarily stunned in disbelief before he finally reacted to what had happened. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">In the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, Golden Core stage cultivators like them were severely suppressed, only retaining the combat strength of the Qi Refining Stage. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Moreover, they couldn't use their magical artifacts and could only cast spells. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Under such circumstances, Meng Chong, possessing Immortal Talent, held the advantage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Perhaps he also gathered quite a few mechanical constructs," the Book Master thought, recalling the large door he had encountered earlier. He didn't know the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, so he could only sigh at the treasure door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Zhou Nongying, a dignified Golden Core cultivator, was actually eliminated by a mere Qi Refining junior. Hmph!" Zheng Danlian grew increasingly agitated. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Zheng Shuangjun hurried along, Zhou Nongying's defeat only intensifying his desire to reunite with his companions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Meng Family's Golden Core cultivator A was overjoyed: "Good! Lord Meng's insight is truly sharp; no wonder he has always supported Meng Chong. Is this the power of someone with Immortal Talent?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"To eliminate a Golden Core cultivator with Qi Refining strength, if I had such achievements, I could boast for a lifetime." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Past the wave of joy, Meng Family cultivator A also felt many concerns. Although Meng Chong had eliminated Zhou Nongying, he must have paid a considerable price. After such a fierce battle, Meng Chong would undoubtedly be weakened and vulnerable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"At this critical moment, we can't let Young Master Meng Chong encounter other cultivators! I must find him quickly to protect him." The Meng Family cultivator was anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Jiufan wandered alone in the Secret Pavilion. He opened a door and entered the next secret chamber. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sun Lingtong slowly appeared. Like Ning Jiufan, he was also searching for Ning Zhuo to regroup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"We must find Little Zhuo quickly!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"Without my cover, it's hard for him to act. If a battle breaks out, it would be disastrous." This was because Sun Lingtong was using the name "Ning Zhuo," which corresponded to the "Entry Standard." If a battle resulted in an outcome, then whether Ning Zhuo won or lost, it would be announced, instantly alerting everyone. This constituted a huge flaw that Sun Lingtong was desperately trying to avoid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">[...]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo pushed open the door and stepped into the next secret chamber. His pupils contracted slightly as he saw the chaotic battlefield within the chamber and then noticed a cultivator. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The cultivator's battle was nearing its end. His opponent was guarding the treasure of the chamber and was down to a single mechanical black snake coiled around the pedestal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The noise of Ning Zhuo entering immediately caught the cultivator's attention. Ning Zhuo's heart sank slightly, but he smiled lightly and greeted politely. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">He had encountered a Golden Core true disciple from the Purple Dawn Pavilion. Of all the competitors, Ning Zhuo's first encounter was with someone he was least familiar with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo's gaze quickly shifted to the pedestal. His heart couldn't help but stir. On the pedestal was a large pile of spirit stones. The quality of the spirit stones was good, mostly mid-grade with a small portion being high-grade. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He instinctively calculated that if he could obtain this pile of spirit stones, it would greatly aid in operating various mechanical constructs and restoring his own mana.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Using spirit stones to drive various mechanisms was the proper way. Previously, Ning Zhuo had used his own blood essence to control the constructs, which was very draining. Using spirit stones would significantly reduce his consumption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core cultivator squinted his eyes, momentarily pausing his attack on the last mechanical black snake. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">He held a mechanical short spear in each hand, and as he slowly turned to face Ning Zhuo, he combined the short spears into a mechanical long spear taller than himself. He planted the long spear into the ground, slightly raising his head: "Ning Zhuo, junior, I'm in need of a container to carry these spoils." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Leave that floating wooden box, and you may leave."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Zhuo was taken aback, then chuckled lightly: "Just the box, senior?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"Why not take a look at these?" He gently patted the small flying box. From it, he took out puppet warriors and spell puppets. Within a few breaths, a dozen mechanical constructs were released, surrounding Ning Zhuo. There were not only puppets but also some beast-shaped constructs. Ning Zhuo's hands even held a mechanical shield and a mechanical crossbow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">This was too much! The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core true disciple looked at the formidable lineup opposite him and then at his own mechanical long spear, his only weapon. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">With a dull thud, Ning Zhuo took out a mechanical cannon. The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core true disciple's eye twitched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Are these all the mechanical constructs you've obtained? Or did you bring them from the trial room?" The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core true disciple couldn't help but ask, his voice turning hoarse. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, spreading his hands: "Senior, does it matter?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"You've been fighting for so long, you must be tired." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"I won't see you off, feel free to choose any door and leave." With that, Ning Zhuo gestured with his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core true disciple's face turned alternately pale and livid, glaring at Ning Zhuo. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo's smile faded slightly, his gaze turning cold: "Please." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Fine, fine, fine!" The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core true disciple nodded repeatedly, unable to quell his anger, but ultimately left the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities with his mechanical long spear. As he left, he slammed the door shut.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo breathed a sigh of relief. He had to appear strong. On one hand, it was for the spirit stones, and on the other, to avoid battle. It was inconvenient for him now; only by regrouping with Sun Lingtong could he avoid the flaw of the trial announcement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Continue collecting constructs, steadily accumulating my own advantage." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Let others fight and exhaust each other, that's the most beneficial path for me." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo waved his hand, and the mechanical constructs surged like a tide, overwhelming the Qi Refining stage mechanical black snake. He collected the spirit stones and quickly cleaned the battlefield with the puppet warriors. Soon, he gathered enough and decisively moved on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core true disciple was filled with anger. It had been so long since he had been treated like this, especially by a mere Qi Refining stage cultivator. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Even if I'm suppressed to the Qi Refining stage, I could crush Ning Zhuo in a one-on-one fight." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"The problem is the favoritism and care the Sage of the Three Sects shows towards trial disciples, it's too much." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"It's unfair!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Thinking of his single mechanical long spear compared to Ning Zhuo's mechanical construct army, the Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core cultivator felt a bit overwhelmed. He was confident that outside the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, dealing with Ning Zhuo would be as easy as flicking a finger, making the latter cry for his parents. Yet, in this Secret Pavilion, his power was greatly suppressed. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He silently vowed to remember this grudge and promised to settle the score if given the chance in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">As he pondered, the door to his left was pushed open and two cultivators entered. The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core cultivator immediately became alert, his gaze shooting over to see the Book Master and Song Fuli. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"It's you?" The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core cultivator relaxed slightly. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Book Master and Song Fuli were overjoyed to see him: "We've been looking for you." The Book Master quickly began analyzing the situation, intending to propose an alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"You want to team up with me? I agree!" The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core cultivator immediately nodded upon hearing the proposal. His straightforward attitude greatly impressed the Book Master, who thought he was a sensible person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core cultivator continued: "Listen, I just encountered Ning Zhuo but didn't make a move on him." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Now, with the three of us joining forces, let's eliminate that kid first!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"Zhu Xuanji's side is too strong. If Ning Zhuo reunites with others, we'll lose our chance to strike." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Book Master immediately agreed and turned to ask Song Fuli's opinion. Song Fuli shrugged, indicating he originally wanted to settle scores with the Void Sect. But since Ning Zhuo was found first, it was his bad luck, and taking him out first wasn't a bad idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Thus, after forming a simple alliance, the three Golden Core cultivators set off together. The Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core cultivator led the way, retracing his steps in haste.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">[...]</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">On the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain, amidst the clouds and mist, Meng Kui overlooked the entire volcanic crater. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Scarlet flame beasts emerged endlessly, determined to destroy the Lava Immortal Palace. They had surrounded the place like a sea isolating an island.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Meng Kui remained calm. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Meng Hu was eager to act and couldn't help but ask, "Brother, have you located the Nascent Soul from the Great Purity Palace? Should I just go and confront him?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"No," Meng Kui shook his head, "We must wait for the other party to reveal themselves and make a move first before we can seize the opportunity and let you appear openly." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">"Otherwise, if you take the initiative to act first, the court ministers will harshly criticize you for disregarding rules and acting recklessly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Cultivators possess immense power. A Nascent Soul like Meng Hu could single-handedly conquer cities, akin to an army. Any nation deploying troops would do so with utmost caution. In a cultivation nation, deploying Nascent Soul level and above cultivators is approached with the same caution. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">If Meng Hu suddenly moved from one place to another without any report, it would be like an army suddenly abandoning its post and moving elsewhere. Such actions would make those in power extremely uneasy and would be strongly opposed and suppressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">That was especially the case in the Southern Bean Kingdom, where the ruler was weak while its ministers were strong. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Meng Hu knew that if he acted brazenly, it would provoke the royal family's fragile and sensitive nerves, possibly leading to an overreaction and severe suppression. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The excuse of a beast siege wouldn't work for Meng Hu. According to normal procedure, Meng Kui should report upwards when unable to handle the situation, allowing the king and court to deliberate first before committing to sending reinforcements. Privately bringing his own Nascent Soul power was a severe violation of court rules and highly inadvisable. Doing so would invite criticism and concentrated attacks from countless people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The only valid excuse would be if Meng Hu unexpectedly discovered a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Great Purity Palace sneaking around. Concerned about potential plots, Meng Hu followed them all the way to Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
