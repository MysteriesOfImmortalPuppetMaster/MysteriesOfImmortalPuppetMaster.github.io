<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Given the Qing-Jiao Army's current state, engaging in a direct confrontation was like throwing an egg at a rock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"This isn't the time to conserve resources."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Qing Chi, disregard logistics consumption. Use that move!" Ning Zhuo shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Understood." Qing Chi immediately acted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Military Formation - Money-Penetrating Ghost!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The military seed exploded with blinding light within Qing Chi's divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The vast stockpile of military logistics, prepared in advance, poured out like a flood—ten percent, thirty percent, fifty percent, eighty percent!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Guided by her sharp intuition, Qing Chi drained eighty percent of the military seed's stored logistics, unleashing a world-shattering power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Under the influence of the military strategy, countless ghostly creatures, like Luo Si before them, rebelled on the spot and pledged allegiance to Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Blood streamed from Qing Chi's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth as she strained to maintain control, issuing military commands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">These ghostly creatures converged into a massive tide, overwhelming the remaining Imperial Guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The great battle finally came to an end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"I can't believe we actually won!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Did we really kill all of them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Qing-Jiao Army gradually reacted, their faces a mix of shock and disbelief at their own achievements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Throughout the fierce battle, they had endured immense psychological pressure. Their enemies had been overwhelmingly powerful, their numbers far surpassing their own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yet after Luo Si's betrayal, the course of the battle had taken an utterly absurd turn, culminating in this astonishing outcome!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"No wonder Ash Bone Elder instructed me to prioritize capturing these ghostly creatures while commanding the Living Realm's armies and bring them back here," Luo Si said. After a moment of rest to stabilize his injuries, he slowly flew before the Qing-Jiao Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Facing Ning Zhuo, he clasped his fists and said, "This humble general, Luo Si, pays his respects to Young Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">In an instant, countless surprised and curious gazes turned toward Luo Si and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo), merely at the Foundation Establishment Stage, had persuaded a Nascent Soul-level great general to defect. Moreover, this general was an enemy commander who had defected in the midst of battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Although Luo Si had once brought great suffering and casualties to White Paper Immortal City, the Qing-Jiao Army had to admit that without his last-minute betrayal, they would have faced certain annihilation in this crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">From this perspective, Luo Si was their savior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">It wasn't as if no Qing-Jiao soldiers had died defending White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">For a moment, the Qing-Jiao soldiers' emotions were complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Jiao Ma's father trembled slightly, his lips trembling with emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He had long suspected his son's true identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A father knows his son best, especially after years of close observation. How could he not understand his son's true capabilities?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">But life has a fundamental truth: sometimes it's best to remain blissfully ignorant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Why dwell on the details?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Whether Jiao Ma was truly Jiao Ma or not, this version of him was undeniably the most advantageous for the Jiao Clan!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">For the sake of the entire Jiao Clan's interests, Jiao Ma's father had long ago committed all the clan's able-bodied members to the White Paper Immortal City's faction. Only the elderly, infirm, and disabled were sent away from the Ghostly Black Marshlands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">For the good of the clan, even he himself was willing to be sacrificed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">So why couldn't his son, Jiao Ma, be sacrificed as well?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Naturally, he was also within the scope of sacrifice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">By sacrificing Jiao Ma alone, they had gained such tremendous benefits. Though Jiao Ma's father secretly grieved, he was also overjoyed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He wasn't just a father; he was the clan leader!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Having a "Jiao Ma" like this meant the Jiao Clan was rolling in it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Now, witnessing Luo Si, a Nascent Soul-level Great General, defect in mid-battle and prostrate himself in submission—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Jiao Ma's biological father was nearly overwhelmed with happiness!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He couldn't believe it, feeling as if he were in a dream, something utterly inconceivable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"So what if I can't believe it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"This is reality!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He secretly pinched his thigh, wincing at the pain, and inwardly shouted, "Even more inconceivable! What if the Prefecture Lord himself were to submit? That wouldn't be beyond possibility!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Qing-Jiao Army was primarily composed of two clans: the Jiao Clan and the Ghost Clan Qing Family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Jiao Ma's biological father's attitude represented the Jiao Clan's stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">However, the cultivators of the Ghost Clan Qing Family harbored more complex emotions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">At that moment, Qing Chi cried out, breaking the deathly silence: "Heavens, Little Ma, you're incredible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"You're just as I expected, Jiao Ma!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Jiao Ma's biological father shifted his gaze to Qing Chi, sighing inwardly: Ah... this foolish girl is still the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But perhaps this is also a kind of happiness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Qing Yan opened his mouth as if to speak, but ultimately said nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo, however, turned his attention to the assembled ghostly creatures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Among them were not only Luo Si's forces, but also several Ghost Kings meticulously cultivated by the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Zhuo looked up at the sky and sighed. "The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord defies the heavens, daring to attempt a blood sacrifice of the White Paper Immortal City. I, blessed by the Qi Luck of the Living Realm's Heaven, am the variable in this calamity—the bane of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"I have long resolved to save the people from the flames of calamity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He lowered his gaze to Luo Si. "Luo Si, for coming to aid me, abandoning darkness for light, I am deeply grateful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Luo Si accepted the acknowledgment, standing tall with a calm gaze. "Though I died in the Living Realm and became a ghostly creature, I have always yearned for the light."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"We owe much to Ash Bone Elder, who began his painstaking scheming and strategic planning a century ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Without his guidance, I would never have met you, my lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Zhuo nodded and sighed. "Exactly. Once I dismantle the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's schemes, I will certainly pay my respects to this venerable elder!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">With Luo Si's formal submission, the battle's outcome was sealed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Qing-Jiao Army achieved a decisive victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The true winner, however, was neither Qing Chi nor the Jiao Clan, but Ning Zhuo himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The unexpected defection of a Nascent Soul-level Great General filled Ning Zhuo with boundless delight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yet he knew that his greatest enemy yet awaited him. Suppressing his joy, he focused on strategizing his next move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">His gaze pierced through the former position of the Imperial Guard's formation, revealing a towering, pitch-black Cloud Wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Luo Si," he asked, "how do we breach this fortress?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Luo Si frowned, deep in thought. "Young Master, I was only recently dispatched to assist with defense. My appointment as commander of this campaign against White Paper Immortal City was a fluke, a scapegoat position. I haven't truly earned their trust."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">His unspoken implication was clear: he didn't know either.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo nodded, his mind stirring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He had quietly noticed a subtle detail: although Luo Si had voluntarily pledged allegiance, he addressed Ning Zhuo as "Young Master" rather than "Lord."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Unlike Yuan Dasheng, this showed that Luo Si still held back, maintaining a cautious stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"It seems we still have a long way to go before Luo Si will truly submit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Indeed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"I'm only at the Foundation Establishment stage, while he's a Nascent Soul-level expert. Whether in terms of command or individual combat power, he's far beyond ordinary!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Both the defense of White Paper Immortal City and Luo Si's recent formation-assisted execution of Immortal Hanyan had demonstrated the Si Yuan Ghost General's terrifying overall strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Convincing such a formidable expert to submit wouldn't be easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This distance might prove to be quite lengthy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo didn't dwell on this. The most pressing task remained dismantling the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-old scheme!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Luo Si continued, "There are two matters I must report to you, Young Master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"First, my orders to besiege White Paper Immortal City were actually a command for blood sacrifice. The casualties on both sides—White Paper Immortal City's defenders and my own troops—were all part of the ritual."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"I withdrew because I had already met the blood sacrifice's requirements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Second, my service record is kept in the City Lord's Mansion of Forgetful River Immortal City. Immortal Hanyan's earlier threats were not empty."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Therefore, I urge you to make full use of me while I still remain!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo felt another stirring in his heart, grasping the art of interacting with Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">This guy lives up to his reputation—constantly thinking deeply but only expressing part of his thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">To communicate with someone like this, you must understand the unspoken words and the true intentions hidden within his speech!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo understood this all too well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">He had spent over a decade enduring in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, studying people all the while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">His imagined adversaries were the City Lord's Mansion and several Nascent Soul-level experts. Coupled with the Ning Clan's oppressive and even hostile environment, these goals and experiences had given him a profound understanding of human nature far beyond his years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Without hesitation, he let out a derisive laugh, his contempt for the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord plain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Though the Blood Sacrifice has been achieved, the reliance on the Imperial Guard's active defense and the deployment of your troops for assistance proves the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is still far from true mastery."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"I have come, guided by the Living Realm's Qi Luck, as the greatest tribulation to the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's attempt to defy heaven and alter fate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"This mission will undoubtedly succeed, and I will have ample time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo's gaze flashed like lightning, his derisive laughter brimming with unwavering confidence in victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">He turned to Luo Si again, his gaze piercing as if it could reach the very depths of the Ghost General's soul. "Let me tell you one more thing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"I've already dispatched another contingent of my military might, their advance directly targeting Forgetful River Immortal City!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"The subordinate you met earlier is one of my capable lieutenants, leading that very force."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"That army's strength far surpasses ours. It's a hidden reserve left behind by the Profound Primordial Scholar, commanded by an exceptionally powerful leader. Someone like Immortal Hanyan would likely be defeated in a single exchange."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Luo Si nodded calmly, remaining silent, but his heart stirred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Ning Zhuo's overwhelming confidence was infectious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">More importantly, Ning Zhuo's response resonated deeply with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">On one hand, Ning Zhuo's strategic deployment alleviated much of Luo Si's survival pressure. On the other, their interaction felt effortless and natural.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo seemed to grasp Luo Si's unspoken thoughts and responded with pinpoint precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">At that moment, Luo Si felt as if he were basking in a gentle spring breeze beside Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Is this just a fluke of exceptional performance?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He's still so young!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">As he hurried his troops to the Cloud Battlefield, he received a divine sense transmission from the Ash Bone Elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">The Ash Bone Elder directly told him that he would meet his wise ruler here and should not hesitate to pledge his allegiance. This was the greatest opportunity and turning point of Luo Si's life!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Luo Si's heart surged with emotion, but he maintained a calm expression as he carefully surveyed the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">As he observed, he became deeply captivated by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">At that moment, Ning Zhuo and Qing Yan were facing off against Immortal Hanyan. Though battered, their performance was remarkably impressive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">After all, Ning Zhuo was still only at the Foundation Establishment stage, yet he wielded such profound mastery of Five Elements Spells and demonstrated exceptional skill in commanding military might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">His formidable physical body, soul, and the aura of cultivating three dantians simultaneously, all at such a young age, made him truly a one-in-ten-thousand prodigy, utterly extraordinary!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Even Immortal Hanyan secretly marveled at Ning Zhuo's brilliance, stoking his resolve to kill him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Luo Si grew increasingly excited the more he watched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He had been waiting for this moment for years!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">This was what the Ash Bone Elder had foretold long ago, and Luo Si had placed complete trust in his words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Wise ruler... Wise ruler... I've finally found you!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Though his heart churned with emotion, Luo Si restrained himself, maintaining a composed expression as he calmly executed his move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">With this single, decisive strike, he shattered the stalemate, completely overturning the course of the battle!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Though this act of surrender didn't align with his original plans, Ning Zhuo didn't want to give the future Mingzhu a negative impression of a traitor during their first meeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">But he had no choice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">If he didn't act, Hanyun would kill the Mingzhu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">To mitigate this negative impression, Luo Si delivered a stirring proclamation at the critical moment. He had racked his brains to craft this document!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Of course, his outward demeanor remained calm and detached, as deep as the Abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Qing Chi's gaze fixed on Ning Zhuo, filled with admiration and a newfound reverence. "Little Ma, tell us what to do. We'll follow your lead!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo glanced at Qing Chi, gave a soft affirmation, then turned his piercing gaze toward the distant Black Cloud Wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">His outward confidence was one thing; the nervousness in his heart was another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">When it came to surface appearances, this youth who had endured years of suppression had honed his composure to rival even Luo Si's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"We'll have to take a calculated risk and probe the situation," Ning Zhuo thought. No sooner had the thought crossed his mind than the situation shifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Boom... rumble...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">The towering Black Cloud Wall began to churn, releasing plumes of Earth Lung Turbid Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The turbid qi surged with overwhelming force, pushing aside the Cloud Wall and expanding outward, forming an even greater and thicker barrier!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">At the Sacrificial Altar, a branch of the Forgetful River flowed around it, within which lay the slumbering True Form of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Meanwhile, his Divided Spirit, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God, intensified his assault on the Ice Coffin while channeling the turbid qi into a Turbid Qi Sky Curtain, greatly enhancing his defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">The moment Luo Si defected, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God immediately sent a message back to the base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">By now, Luo Si should have been cursed to death by Immortal Hanyan during their confrontation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Yet he still lived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Clearly, something had gone wrong at the base, the Forgetful River Immortal City!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God naturally heard Ning Zhuo's confident declaration. To claim he wasn't apprehensive would be a lie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">What he truly feared wasn't Ning Zhuo himself, but the Qi Luck of the Living Realm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Although Ning Zhuo was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, his combat prowess rivaled that of Nascent Soul-level experts—a rare phenomenon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Moreover, the fact that General Luo Si, a high-ranking officer, had defected mid-battle proved that Ning Zhuo was the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's greatest calamity!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">The Cloud Wall was formed by the Grand Formation, but this Grand Formation could be disrupted from the outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">Any disruption to the Formation would inevitably affect the Sacrificial Altar. The backlash from its destruction would bolster the enemy's strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">To prevent this, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God decisively shattered the Cloud Wall and adopted the most conservative strategy, deploying his most potent means to create the strongest possible defense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">This defense manifested as a thick, viscous, and roiling Turbid Qi Sky Curtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">"With this Sky Curtain, I can buy more time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">"Fighting a Child of Destiny like this, the crux lies in the contest of Qi Luck!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">"I must retrieve the Nether Dragon Scissors from the Ice Coffin and deliver it to my True Form."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God understood the critical importance of this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">However, the Ice Coffin was formed from the Cold Abyss Ice Coffin Candle, a masterpiece and trump card of the current Ghostfire Prefecture Lord. Only eight other Fire Candles could rival its power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">The Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God's methods were limited, and eroding the Ice Coffin would require tremendous effort and time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">With no other choice, the Earthly Fiend Turbid Filth God had no alternative but to proceed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">The two National Artifacts for suppressing Qi Luck, the Nether Dragon Scissors and the Lord of Forgetful River Seal, were the optimal solutions. The Nether Dragon Scissors were within reach, but the Lord of Forgetful River Seal was already embedded within the Grand Formation, suppressing the Soundless Ghost Monk's Lifebound Buddha Wheel. Retrieving it now would cause the Lifebound Buddha Wheel to stir up trouble again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">If the Lifebound Buddha Wheel were unleashed, might it summon the Soundless Ghost Monk back?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">That was a very real possibility!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">Ning Zhuo led the group, standing before the Turbid Qi Sky Curtain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">They took turns employing various methods, but the results were as discouraging as trying to scrape off the qi—utterly ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">More and more expectant gazes turned toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">Ning Zhuo couldn't think of a way to break the deadlock. Though he maintained a calm facade, inwardly he grew increasingly anxious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">Luo Si cleared his throat and paused his efforts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">His injuries still lingered, and his condition was far from optimal. Sensing the vibrations within his Storage Belt, he retrieved a luminous goose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">This luminous goose was a transformed form of the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale, which Luo Si had forcefully sealed. However, the Great Primordial Dispersal Scale was a treasured artifact left by the Profound Primordial Scholar, possessing profound and immense power. Luo Si's seal was only temporary, not permanent, and now needed to be reinforced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="333">"Hmm?" In that instant, Ning Zhuo's gaze was irresistibly drawn to the luminous goose!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
