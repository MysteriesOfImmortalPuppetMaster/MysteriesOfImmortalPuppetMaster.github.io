<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Let me see, let me see!" Sun Lingtong was very curious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo told him that the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat couldn't be burned for now, and instead, due to the fire, he had obtained a cultivation method, which surprised Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">After witnessing the technique being activated in the flames, Sun Lingtong sighed: "From what we learned at the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, this Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat has been a treasure passed down for many generations."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Unexpectedly, after falling into your hands, it revealed the complete cultivation method."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"This technique is powerful. If one succeeds in cultivating it, everyone could temporarily enter the embryonic breathing state, which greatly enhances physical cultivation and combat abilities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"You've been having quite good luck lately."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo with newfound respect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He then asked: "What do you plan to do next?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Standing beside him, Ning Zhuo stopped the fire cremation Prajna Spirit Scripture and gradually extinguished the flames. He frowned, troubled, looking at the undamaged Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat: "I'm considering returning to the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect to seek help from the Spirit Concealment Willow to comprehend the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">After his failure, Ning Zhuo had tried to comprehend this technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">However, this method was purely a body cultivation technique. His advanced Five Elements realm offered no help, and he could only rely on his own experience and knowledge to learn, understand, and comprehend it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This made progress too slow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Having a master who practiced this technique to guide him would help.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat was clearly an ancient treasure, and it wasn't clear how the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect had obtained and passed it down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">As for the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing,' from Ning Zhuo's current research, he guessed it wasn't the newest technique. It should be earlier than the Three Sect's Supreme Method but much later than the Five Organs Temple Divine Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo strangely and blurted out: "The Spirit Concealment Willow is already in such a state, it probably can't support your comprehension of this technique?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Last time you nearly exhausted it to death, it's just barely recovered. If you abuse its power again like this, you might permanently kill it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"After all, neither of us can strictly control the Spirit Concealment Willow or regulate its level of assistance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, his expression gloomy: "That's what I'm worried about too, Big Brother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">After further discussion, they decided to stick to their original plan and continue their journey. During this time, Ning Zhuo would rely on his own abilities to comprehend the technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Sun Lingtong would help too.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">As for the Spirit Concealment Willow, they would let it recover properly. In the future, when Ning Zhuo encountered obstacles or bottlenecks in understanding this technique, he could ride the Ten Thousand Li Dragon back to the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect to seek its assistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"The Spirit Concealment Willow is currently weak. Even if I went back now, using it to comprehend the technique would only allow minimal progress."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"This would make the comprehension process fragmented and inefficient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"It's better to let it recover fully first. Then, I can use its help to comprehend the technique. This will be much more efficient!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Having made up his mind, Ning Zhuo entrusted Sun Lingtong with the Ten Thousand Li Dragon while he devoted himself to studying the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.'</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Though this unexpected development brought him practical gains, he was actually unwilling in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">What true scripture or technique could compare to healing Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Now, although he had cleverly obtained the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, this technique prevented him from burning it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"If I had known this earlier, who would have wasted so much time at the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Mother, your child has failed you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">With such thoughts, he approached studying the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing' with some resentment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Once, while reading the passage "When first learning to regulate breath, one must imagine the qi, exiting from where it exits, entering from where the navel extinguishes, regulating until extremely fine," his body suddenly followed his mind's intention, and he unconsciously began regulating his breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He struggled to hold his breath, trying to breathe through his navel, counting to eighty-one. However, the qi in his body went wild, becoming uncontrollable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">A sharp pain shot through his abdomen. Ning Zhuo felt the qi in his body like an untamed horse, crashing everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Cold sweat broke out on his forehead, but his heart grew stubborn, and he refused to give up. Gritting his teeth, he forcefully continued cultivating, trying to guide the qi into his dantian. However, the qi not only refused to comply but became increasingly violent, as if threatening to tear his body apart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">His face gradually turned pale, his lips purple, and the qi in his body felt like an invisible net, tightly entangling him. He tried to exhale through his mouth and nose but found his breathing blocked and unable to flow smoothly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Ah!" He cried out as the chaotic qi in his body finally erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo felt an intense pain in his chest, followed by a mouthful of blood spurting out, staining the ground before him red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">His body convulsed violently, losing all control at this moment. He felt as if all strength had been drained from him, and he collapsed to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo's vision blurred, his consciousness gradually fading. He heard a buzzing in his ears, as if everything in heaven and earth was moving away from him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Though his eyes were open, they had grown so dim that he found himself in endless darkness, with everything around him silent, only his extremely weak breathing echoing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Though the qi in his body was no longer rampaging, the pain was cruel and heavy, as if countless sharp blades were cutting and piercing every part of his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The pain nearly made him faint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Hold on... must... hold on." Ning Zhuo struggled to maintain consciousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He knew very clearly that he needed to take medicine pills for healing immediately. If he couldn't do this, any delay would cause his injuries to worsen dramatically, making future healing much more costly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">But he couldn't move, not even a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">His vision recovered some light, but remained very blurry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The dizziness grew stronger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Just as he was about to truly pass out, a familiar and dear figure entered his field of vision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Big... Brother." He spoke, his voice extremely faint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Sun Lingtong was greatly alarmed. In the dragon head cabin, he suddenly felt his heart racing, sensing something was wrong, and quickly thought about checking himself for any issues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">He immediately checked the dragon spirit fire in the pearl shell and found it still sleeping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Little Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong suddenly called out and decisively left the dragon head cabin, rushing to the cultivation chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">As soon as he opened the door, he saw Ning Zhuo lying unconscious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The blood in front of Ning Zhuo, his paper-white face, and his body covered in sweat made Sun Lingtong's heart ache.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong immediately took action, checking Ning Zhuo's condition, taking out medicine pills, and infusing spiritual power to help him digest the medicine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo felt reassured and fell into a deep sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">When he woke up, a day and night had passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He felt much better!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Though his body was still weak, the cruel pain had reduced to barely a tenth of what it was. His head still felt dizzy, making him feel top-heavy when walking, but it was much better than when he had gone astray in his cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Big Brother." Ning Zhuo walked slowly to the dragon head cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong had already sensed Ning Zhuo as soon as he left his living quarters and walked in the corridor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">When Ning Zhuo opened the door and entered the dragon head cabin, Sun Lingtong didn't turn around, just snorted coldly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Big Brother, I was wrong." Ning Zhuo walked behind Sun Lingtong, smiling awkwardly and bowing his head in admission of guilt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Only then did Sun Lingtong turn around, his brows tightly knitted, face stern, scolding harshly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Little Zhuo, you fool, you actually tried to cultivate the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing'?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"This time you've taken quite a fall, and it serves you right!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"The feeling of going astray in cultivation should be the best reminder for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"You've already cultivated the Demonic Blood Vein Technique and established your lower dantian, yet you still attempt to cultivate another technique?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"This is something even novice qi-cultivators know well, yet you made such a mistake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo scratched his head: "Thinking about it now, it is indeed bewildering. I was too absorbed in comprehending the 'Great Art of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing' and unconsciously tried to practice it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"When I encountered resistance midway, I should have stopped, but I was in a bad mood and feeling stubborn, so I wanted to persist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"That I could recover so quickly this time is thanks to your timely help! Big Brother, you truly are my good Big Brother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Being praised like this only made Sun Lingtong angrier. He jumped up, made a small fist, and gave Ning Zhuo's head a hard knock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"You little brat, still putting on a smiling face!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"I'm punishing you with seven days of confinement to reflect on your mistakes, during which you may not cultivate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo's expression immediately changed, his face turning pale as he exclaimed: "Big Brother, what about my daily practice?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong frowned deeply, his face growing red with anger, put his hands on his hips, and shouted: "Did you not understand what I just said?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"I understand, I understand!" Ning Zhuo quickly responded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Get out of here and go to your confinement!" Sun Lingtong pointed toward the cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Ning Zhuo left dejectedly, his face dim and lifeless, taking his leave from Sun Lingtong and departing the dragon head cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Through the image projection, Sun Lingtong observed Ning Zhuo walking through the corridor and entering his living quarters, only then letting out a long sigh, thinking to himself: "Little Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Only now did Sun Lingtong show deep concern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He understood Ning Zhuo's current state very well!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Seeing Ning Zhuo now was like seeing his past self.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Once upon a time, when his master had become trapped in Magma Immortal Palace and mysteriously disappeared, Sun Lingtong, even with just qi cultivation level, had repeatedly ventured deep into Fire Persimmon Mountain, entering the Magma Immortal Palace multiple times, each time risking his life to explore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Did he not know that what he was doing was dangerous?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Did he not know that his master was likely already dead?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Looking back at his past, Sun Lingtong realized that these seemingly simple and obvious questions were actually not clear to him at the time!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Because he was solely focused on finding his master, and even though reason told him there was little hope, he had pushed that awareness to the deepest corner of his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">For a long time, the belief in finding his master had supported Sun Lingtong, driving him to keep striving forward regardless of personal safety.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Now, Ning Zhuo's situation was so similar to his own!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"So, how did I manage to get through it?"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
