<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Better to do it now than wait for a better day. After their duel was successfully arranged, Zhu Guizhi and Ning Zhuo quietly left the grotto and headed toward a martial arts hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">A Golden Core-level battle was not something the training formations of the Blue Stone Grotto could withstand. If they broke it, Ning Zhuo would have to pay for the repairs out of his own pocket.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This was a secret battle, with no other spectators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Zhu Guizhi and Ning Zhuo entered the arena and took their positions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo extended a hand. "Madam Zhu, you are my elder. You may go first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Since this was a performance, he had to play the part fully. Ning Zhuo displayed the characteristic arrogance of a genius, showing a blatant disregard for a Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Zhu Guizhi was so incensed she took a deep breath, immediately forming hand seals as green points of light gathered around her like fireflies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"I invite the Green Spirit Lord to preside over the virtue of life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">As she prayed, the divine artifact, the Green Emperor Staff, was summoned by her divine sense and flew out from her storage bracelet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Legal power was consumed, and divine power descended, focusing on the divine artifact to form a silhouette - illusory yet majestic. Soon, the divine power solidified, forming a divine avatar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Land God: Green Spirit Lord!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">His body was hunched like a dragon, his face covered in bark-like patterns, and his beard resembled hanging aerial roots. He held a natural wooden staff - the divine artifact Green Emperor Staff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo patted his Storage Belt, releasing a Golden Core-level mechanism. It wore an ice helmet and was clad in Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor with the beast-heads of ice dragons on its shoulders. It was Snow Pivot Guard Xie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The divine avatar struck the Green Emperor Staff onto the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Rumble...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The floor tiles of the martial arts hall vibrated and cracked. Countless thick roots burst from the earth, intertwining and growing like living things, forming a forest of roots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He was moving to control the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo’s eyes flickered slightly. On the surface, his ten fingers moved rapidly, tugging at invisible spider silks, but in reality, he was merely transmitting divine thoughts, telling Snow Pivot Guard Xie to fight on her own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Snow Pivot Guard Xie raised both hands, and a stream of extreme cold erupted from her entire body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The cold current froze the root forest, causing the air temperature to plummet and condensing points of ice crystals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"This cold energy is impressive." Facing it personally, Zhu Guizhi felt a slight chill in her heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The divine avatar possessed Golden Core-level combat power, and so did Snow Pivot Guard Xie. The difference, perhaps, was that the latter's core utilized Nascent Soul-level precious materials. In a way, she possessed a hint of Nascent Soul-level foundation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The divine avatar immediately changed tactics, waving the Green Emperor Staff. Countless emerald-green leaves appeared out of thin air, swirling and flying with a sharp whistling sound, shooting toward Snow Pivot Guard Xie like thousands of flying daggers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Snow Pivot Guard Xie released six Cold Steel Mechanical Spheres. The mechanical spheres rotated around her continuously, transforming into a miniature blizzard tornado that was both offensive and defensive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The leaves, filled with life energy, flew into the snowy vortex and were instantly frozen, losing their spiritual light before being ground into powder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The two sides traded blows, with offense and defense constantly shifting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Green Spirit Lord frequently cast Divine Arts, while Snow Pivot Guard Xie used frost spells, fighting to a standstill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Seeing that he could not break the deadlock, the Green Spirit Lord personally wielded the Green Emperor Staff to engage in close combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Snow Pivot Guard Xie fell into a disadvantage, struggling continuously to change the tide, but with little effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Zhu Guizhi felt a pang of doubt: Why is the close-combat performance of Ning Zhuo's mechanism so much worse than during his fight with Gu Qing?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">During the fight with Gu Qing, Ning Zhuo had been in full control. In this match, Ning Zhuo was secretly training his troops, relying entirely on the inherent spirituality of Snow Pivot Guard Xie. Naturally, it wasn't as natural or powerful as when Ning Zhuo controlled it personally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Fortunately, spirituality has its own growth potential. Under pressure, she recalled the scenes of fighting under her master's control, absorbing nutrition from imitation and rapidly growing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After a dozen rounds, the Green Spirit Lord had firmly taken the upper hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">However, Zhu Guizhi’s brow gradually furrowed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">She had previously purchased intelligence and knew the details of the battle between Ning Zhuo and Gu Qing. Watching up to this point, she was certain: Ning Zhuo was holding back! He wasn't giving his all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This made her feel another surge of humiliation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo was merely a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator, a young man in the mid-stage, yet he didn't even use his full strength against a Golden Core cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">What did he take her for?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">How much did he look down on her?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Immediately, Zhu Guizhi cried out in a low voice, "Green Spirit Lord, use your Divine Ability and defeat her completely!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Land Gods were generally demi-gods or minor gods. The true body of the Green Spirit Lord was only at the Golden Core level. He was only being cultivated by Zhu Guizhi, descending via his divine artifact, the Green Emperor Staff, to exert his full strength; thus, the avatar also had Golden Core-level power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Within the Zhu Clan, although Zhu Guizhi wasn't at the very top, she was at the middle-upper level. Furthermore, she was the leader of a certain faction. At her level, she was naturally different from someone like Zhu Fenxiang. She didn't just serve a god; to a certain extent, she cultivated minor gods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Therefore, she possessed a certain degree of command over the Green Spirit Lord's avatar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This was unlike the relationship between Zhu Fenxiang and the Earthen Prison True Monarch. Just because Zhu Fenxiang had a differing opinion, she was loathed and disliked by the Earthen Prison True Monarch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Divine Ability: Entwining Wood!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Roots acted like dragons and pythons, continuously lunging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Relying on her own spirituality, Snow Pivot Guard Xie dodged for a while before being caught by the roots and wrapped in layers. Although she resisted with all her might, she ultimately could not withstand the Divine Ability, and her Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor began to crack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">If this continues, the battle is lost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">At the critical moment, Ning Zhuo finally intervened. His ten fingers moved rapidly, directing Snow Pivot Guard Xie. On one hand, he used the ice dragon beast-heads to emit a frigid blue light, scanning for key roots; on the other hand, his divine sense directly controlled the Cold Steel Mechanical Spheres, forming a large amount of ice vapor to assist the attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ultimately, Snow Pivot Guard Xie escaped, but her Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor was mostly shattered, revealing the magical ice tendons formed by the convergence of legal power threads within. Her appearance was quite disheveled and pitiful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">A cold glint flashed in Zhu Guizhi's eyes. As expected, only now is Ning Zhuo using his full strength. The combat power erupted by his mechanism is significantly different from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Realizing this, Zhu Guizhi grew even more furious, urging the Green Spirit Lord to intensify the onslaught.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But now that Ning Zhuo had taken control, the battle took on a completely different look.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Snow Pivot Guard Xie fought with extraordinary agility while using Golden Core-level legal power to condense new ice tendons to replace what was missing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The Permanent Silence Profound Ice - a Nascent Soul-level material at her core - was also slowly being consumed to restore the Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Zhu Guizhi showed a look of surprise. When Ning Zhuo goes all out, the Green Spirit Lord alone cannot suppress him even with a Divine Ability!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">This boy is arrogant, but he certainly has the capital for it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Among the mechanical materials, I can sense the aura of Permanent Silence Profound Ice. No wonder the frost energy contains the intent of eternal silence, constantly eroding the divine body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Zhu Guizhi knew the Green Spirit Lord very well and knew he had no more powerful trump cards. According to the current trend, Ning Zhuo would inevitably turn the tables.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Zhu Guizhi formed another hand seal. Legal power surged, transforming into arcs of electricity at her fingertips, jumping and flickering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"I invite - Golden Light Holy Mother, to preside over the Eye of Heavenly Tribulation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Crack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">A blinding bolt of lightning struck down without warning, instantly condensing into a new divine avatar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Lightning Mother: Golden Light Holy Mother!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">She was dressed in golden rose-colored clothes with a moon-white celestial sash, her eyes sharp as lightning. Her divine power transformed into a pair of divine artifacts - the Lightning Mirrors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The left mirror was as deep as night, the right as brilliant as the sun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Lightning Mother avatar floated in the air and brought the two mirrors together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Divine Art: Heavenly Thunderbolt!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">A brilliant bolt of lightning, as thick as a bucket, erupted with a deafening roar and struck directly at Snow Pivot Guard Xie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The Lightning Mother avatar also possessed Golden Core-level combat power. In a two-on-one situation, the battlefield dynamics shifted instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Snow Pivot Guard Xie fell completely into a disadvantage. Bolts of lightning struck down, blasting her Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor into fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo felt a surge of joy as he attempted to control her with full force, feeling his own limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">One against two is indeed too forced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He struggled to stabilize Snow Pivot Guard Xie's footing, his divine sense being consumed rapidly. He used every means to resist the enemy's onslaught while simultaneously repairing the mechanism. He was being pushed from all sides, becoming increasingly flustered and unable to balance internal and external needs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Young Master Ning Zhuo, how do you feel now?" Zhu Guizhi said with a smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">She guessed that Ning Zhuo likely had a second Golden Core-level mechanism. But it didn't matter!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo was only one person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">There was a difference between giving your all to control one mechanism and controlling two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This is the beauty of the Divine Summoning Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The divine avatars fight on their own; there's no need for me, the cultivator, to divide my mind or attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Mechanisms are still inconvenient things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo gave a soft chuckle. "Madam Zhu, my methods are not limited to this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He patted his storage belt and released Snow-Colored Maiden Hui onto the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">She stood six feet three inches tall with a graceful figure, her body covered in the shimmering Three-Colored Enamel Armor. Most striking were the two additional pairs of sub-arms beneath her main pair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A total of three pairs - six arms - suddenly unfurled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Snow-Colored Maiden Hui suspended herself in mid-air, her six mechanical palms forming seals simultaneously. Her movements were graceful and precise, like a dance on ice, yet they contained lethal killing intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">She joined the fray, heading straight for the Lightning Mother avatar that had just shown its might!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Oh? He really does have a second Golden Core mechanism." Zhu Guizhi immediately cast a concerned gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo appeared to be controlling her, but in reality, he was letting Snow-Colored Maiden Hui fight on her own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Several frost spells were cast to counter the lightning divine arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">After watching for a moment, Zhu Guizhi immediately noticed the difference between Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Snow Pivot Guard Xie. The former's actions were more precise and focused on single targets, while the latter leaned toward large-scale area attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The more agile performance of Snow-Colored Maiden Hui led Zhu Guizhi to mistakenly believe that this was Ning Zhuo's primary combat mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">However, after deploying two, Ning Zhuo's control has clearly dropped significantly. Zhu Guizhi was misled by the surface appearance, completely unaware that Ning Zhuo had also gradually relaxed his control over Snow Pivot Guard Xie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">This was training! And this was a perfect opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">It wasn't easy to find Golden Core-level divine avatars to train against. Furthermore, Zhu Guizhi was the one paying the price for the Divine Summoning Art, making this even more cost-effective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Snow-Colored Maiden Hui used softness to overcome hardness against the Lightning Mother, temporarily stabilizing the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Snow Pivot Guard Xie began to slowly regain ground against the Green Spirit Lord avatar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Seeing the unfavorable trend again, Zhu Guizhi immediately used her divine sense to communicate with the Lightning Mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Divine Art: Streaming Light Instant Shadow!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">In an instant, the Lightning Mother transformed into a bolt of lightning, her speed reaching its absolute limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo’s heart jolted, and he immediately intervened in the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">At the critical moment, he decisively controlled Snow-Colored Maiden Hui to cast a defensive spell, barely avoiding being defeated in a single strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Fast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">So fast!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Too fast!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The Lightning Mother avatar was like a startled swan, crisscrossing the battlefield. By her power alone, she suppressed both Snow-Colored Maiden Hui and Snow Pivot Guard Xie with no suspense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">They still lack powerful frost spells! Ning Zhuo saw the weakness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The spells mastered by the two mechanisms were based on the arrangements of runes and formations within them. The number was limited and the content fixed. Facing the sudden burst of lightning, they were immediately stretched thin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The two mechanical puppets were gradually being heavily damaged, their bodies becoming battered and broken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"Young Master Ning Zhuo, perhaps it is time for you to release your third Golden Core mechanism." Zhu Guizhi’s words were both a test and a provocation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo gave a cold snort. "There is no need for that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">In the next moment, Snow-Colored Maiden Hui activated her innate talent, first freezing Snow Pivot Guard Xie within a block of ice, and then placing herself inside a massive block of ice as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">This passive defense bought Ning Zhuo some time to repair their mechanical bodies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">At the same time, containing the power of the Ice Grease Jade Hand, the ice blocks possessed a healing efficacy, effectively treating their spirituality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Though their spirituality had been heavily protected, it had ultimately been damaged in the fierce battle. The power of the Ice Grease Jade Hand, while not specifically designed for it, did have a healing effect. Previously, Yuan Dasheng's spirituality had been maintained by this kind of ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Seeing this, Zhu Guizhi's eyes brightened. She felt Ning Zhuo was at his wit's end and was forced into this passive choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Lightning Mother avatar thought the same. Taking the lead, she struck hard against the ice block where Snow Pivot Guard Xie was hidden.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Through the intense battle, although Snow-Colored Maiden Hui had entered the stage later, her mechanical damage far exceeded that of Snow Pivot Guard Xie. The reason, ultimately, was the inferior quality of her materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Snow Pivot Guard Xie was severely disrupted by the Lightning Mother; the electricity penetrated the ice and struck her mechanical body directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Because of this, the Lightning Mother avatar revealed her true form.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"You've fallen for it." At the critical moment, Ning Zhuo boldly triggered Snow Pivot Guard Xie's self-detonation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In an instant, the offensive energy accumulated previously was harnessed by Ning Zhuo, transforming into a massive cold wave. Within a few breaths, it completely covered the vast martial arts hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">The Green Spirit Lord was heavily injured, his aura fading.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Lightning Mother, who was closest, was directly blown apart into nothingness!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">As for the unrecognizable, self-detonated Snow Pivot Guard Xie, she was rapidly restored to her original form under Ning Zhuo's operation. The price paid was the rapid consumption of the Permanent Silence Profound Ice at her core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo gave a slight smile. "Madam Zhu, it's time for you to invite your third deity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Zhu Guizhi: "..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">After a moment of silence, she decisively conceded.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
