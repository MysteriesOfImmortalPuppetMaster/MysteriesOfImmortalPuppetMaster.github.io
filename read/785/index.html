<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a prayer mat. In his divine sea, various thoughts rose and fell, colliding fiercely with one another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The mechanical blueprints for Snow Pivot Guard Xie were laid bare in the depths of his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This had been his own design from the start.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">However, the elevation of his realm in artifact refining and mechanical arts, combined with the lifetime of experience and memories inherited from Ling Mo, had caused Ning Zhuo's foundation to surge significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Regarding the design of the Snow Pivot Guard Xie, he now had far better ideas!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"When I previously designed this mechanical puppet, my primary thought was to revolve it around the low-grade talent Snow Soul Ice Spirit, making the mechanical body utilize this talent as much as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"But at that time, I was limited by my own ceilings in the ice attribute, artifact refining, and mechanical arts. This resulted in a mechanical combat puppet that, despite possessing Golden Core-level combat power, was not an excellent design."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"The Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Forging Demonic Art will be the second core of my design this time!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Once the keynote of the design was set, a new primary material naturally entered Ning Zhuo's vision - Everlasting Profound Ice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">This was a type of ice crystal unique to Frost-Roar Valley, with qualities ranging from the Qi Refining level all the way to the Body Integration-level! In fact, it was widely believed in the cultivation world that the deepest parts of Frost-Roar Valley likely hidden Grand Ascension-level Everlasting Profound Ice!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Beyond the Grand Ascension stage lay the Tribulation Transcendence to become an Immortal - the ultimate end of power in the cultivation world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This was the prestige of a World Wonder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Every World Wonder was a producer of the world's top-tier resources. They were the greatest holy lands for cultivation, yet simultaneously, they were lands of death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Surrounding every World Wonder, a massive number of cultivators would often gather to conduct mining operations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The vast majority of them could only gather materials on the periphery of the World Wonder for their entire lives. Furthermore, many suffered from numerous diseases because their bodies were ravaged by the local "Laws" due to long-term exposure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"I hope the Commerce Hall has Golden Core-level Everlasting Profound Ice for sale." Ning Zhuo made an estimate and felt the possibility was quite high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The Northern Wind Kingdom and the Flying Cloud Kingdom were nearly adjacent, with the buffer zone being the Ghostly Black Marshlands ruled by White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">After Wen Ruanyu reported back, the entire high council of the Myriad Manifestations Sect was stirred, wanting to take the opportunity to involve themselves in White Paper Immortal City. Aside from the city's own soul path resources, it held immense strategic value in terms of geography.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">An even better point was that in this competition, the Flying Cloud Kingdom could not take action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Once a cultivation kingdom intervened, it would touch a sensitive nerve and inevitably trigger countermeasures from the Northern Wind Kingdom. Any slight carelessness could lead to an escalation of conflict between the two nations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">As a super power, the Myriad Manifestations Sect remained above the "bottom line" and was fully capable of acting. Of course, they had to act under a legitimate pretext, and the intensity of their intervention had to be strictly controlled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Perhaps I can even try for Nascent Soul-level Everlasting Profound Ice?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Having selected the primary material, Ning Zhuo strode forward along this line of thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Modify the Everlasting Profound Ice to serve as the base for the new primary material, carrying the spirituality of the Snow Soul Ice Spirit talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Snow Soul Ice Spirit can create cold ice. By using the base, although it cannot create Everlasting Profound Ice, could it provide replenishment?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"This is a feasible plan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo did not use the Luo Shu to perform calculations. Relying solely on intuition, he felt it could work.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He trusted his feelings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This feeling was strong; it was a physical sensation brought about by his body having endured the relevant "Laws" of artifact refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo's train of thought was unimpeded as it began to unfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"The skeleton needs both strength and spiritual conductivity... Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Heart Iron for the bones, Profound Ice Marrow for the marrow - that's roughly the direction. The specific choice of similar materials will require testing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"The methods for modifying the body in the Eternal Silence Profound Ice Body Forging Demonic Art provide great reference value."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Right, I can also refer to the Demonic Contamination Blood Meridian Art! How about creating meridians made of ice-type Qi?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"That way, they can not only conduct spiritual energy and support the frame, but the meridian structure itself can also exert and retract force."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Good, this is a brilliant idea."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo cheered for himself, a sense of joy rippling through his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">He continued to think deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Countless thoughts intertwined like river water, flowing through his divine sea with unstoppable momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He retained some of the old structures of Snow Pivot Guard Xie, such as the Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor, and expanded upon them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In this way, the primary materials of the brand-new Snow Pivot Guard Xie were completely changed, the method of body construction was significantly improved, and the combat style changed accordingly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"The characteristic of Everlasting Profound Ice is to absorb sound and accumulate it continuously, then erupt violently upon reaching the limit, forming a terrifying wave of sonorous cold."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"The Hexagonal Profound Ice Armor and the new ice-sculpted body will both have this trait - absorbing attacks, accumulating power, and breaking limits to erupt into a sonorous cold tide!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Once the ice armor or the body is worn down, use the Snow Soul Ice Spirit talent to create new Profound Ice to replenish itself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Marvelous, truly marvelous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">This design combined "destruction" and "rebirth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Every fierce attack from the enemy was merely accumulating power for the next, even more, terrifying explosion!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He could almost see how, on future battlefields, the new Snow Pivot Guard Xie would shatter time and time again under the enemy's heavy assaults, only to rise proudly from the destruction of the cold tide, becoming an inescapable nightmare for all foes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The enemy would fall into an awkward predicament: if they attacked Snow Pivot Guard Xie, she would accumulate power; if they didn't attack, they would just be beaten by her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Haha, let the enemies solve that problem themselves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo continued his research.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Next was the improvement of the mechanical joints. Should the beast-head shoulder guards be retained? That remained to be seen. The six mechanical orbs were definitely staying; they were a means for mid-range attacks and laying out the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Various details were continuously refined through Ning Zhuo's contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A brand-new design blueprint first had its framework established, and then various details were filled in like flesh and blood, each in its proper place and interlocking perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">At the same time, a massive list of required precious materials was finalized by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">He immediately contacted Gongsun Yan, sending him out to make purchases.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Gongsun Yan hurriedly left the Grotto-dwelling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo's material requirements shocked him: "The Young Master actually wants to buy Nascent Soul-level materials? What does he want to do? Can it be that he can already process materials of this level?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Though he is a first-rate genius, he is still only a Foundation Establishment cultivator. And only at the mid-stage, at that!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Gongsun Yan couldn't figure it out, but that didn't stop him from executing Ning Zhuo's orders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">People were coming and going within the Commerce Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Gongsun Yan first inquired about the primary material.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Hearing that it involved a transaction for Nascent Soul-level materials, a Qiger was immediately summoned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The Qiger said, "This is the main mountain gate of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Other outposts might be at risk of low stock, but our reserves of Everlasting Profound Ice here are more than sufficient. Never mind Nascent Soul-level; we even have Soul Formation-level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Gongsun Yan breathed a sigh of relief. With the problem of the primary material solved, he had completed over half of Ning Zhuo's task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He then inquired about the other materials; almost all were available.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">For the remaining few items, the Qiger looked hesitant: "Let me check the latest status for you. They aren't in the current inventory, but as you know, there are truly too many cultivators in our Myriad Manifestations Sect. Transactions happen every moment; the volume is massive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"It's possible that some materials have been purchased but haven't been registered yet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Upon checking, there were indeed results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">"You're in luck. This batch of Profound Ice Marrow was just harvested from the 'Thousand-Year Ice Lake,' and they are all of high-grade quality. The cultivator team that performed the mission just returned, and after the handover, someone in the team sold their share."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"However, the Ice Fiend you want is not available."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Perhaps you could try your luck at the black market?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Gongsun Yan left the Commerce Hall. The requirements on Ning Zhuo's list were nearly finished, with only the Ice Fiend remaining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Fiends were things that were naturally difficult to preserve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Gongsun Yan followed the Qiger's advice and headed to Thousand Stove Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Not long ago, Sun Lingtong had purchased the second batch of demonic souls at the black market here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Gongsun Yan hadn't even entered the black market yet; he was passing through the outer bazaar when his attention was caught by the sound of an argument.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Refund me! Give me a refund!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"This 'Earth Yin Cold Spring' of yours is clearly contaminated with Nine Nether Ice Fiend. The fiendish qi is so thick, how am I supposed to use it to refine Warm Jade artifacts?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">But the shopkeeper was stubborn: "Bah! Keep dreaming!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Goods sold are non-refundable and non-exchangeable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"Who told you that your own eyesight was too poor to see the defect?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"Besides, you wanted to buy Earth Yin Cold Spring, and I've already sold it to you. You tell me, is the water in this bottle Earth Yin Cold Spring or not?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The buyer gnashed his teeth, unable to find a rebuttal for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Gongsun Yan's ears perked up: "Nine Nether Ice Fiend? That is a top-tier grade among Ice Fiends. If I buy this, I'll have exceeded the mission requirements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">He immediately approached the dispute and cupped his hands to the seller: "Greetings, Fellow Daoist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He expressed his intent to buy, and after verifying the goods were correct, he completed the transaction on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The buyer-turned-seller had actually made a small profit; he was overjoyed, mocked the shopkeeper a few times, and swaggered away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The shopkeeper was not deterred, however. Instead, he stopped Gongsun Yan, saying he had more similar goods that were difficult to sell and asked if Gongsun Yan needed them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Gongsun Yan nodded immediately: "I'll take them! I'll buy as much as you have!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo was wealthy and overbearing; he had indicated on the list that some materials should be purchased without limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Gongsun Yan executed this order quite thoroughly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">When he returned to report, even Ning Zhuo was somewhat surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The big-headed youth had estimated that gathering these materials would take at least seven or eight days, but he hadn't expected Gongsun Yan to achieve it in one go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">After asking for details, Ning Zhuo learned the specifics.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"It seems my luck in procurement this time was quite good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"The materials are all here. Next is the rebuilding of the Snow Pivot Guard Xie."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">In a situation where Yuan Dasheng and Meng Yehu were unable to participate in battle, this matter was highly necessary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo immediately entered seclusion, throwing himself wholeheartedly into the intensive task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Meanwhile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">In Duanmu Zhang's cave-dwelling, a fierce debate was gradually nearing its end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">And the result of this debate was about to bring a hurricane-like impact to the Confucian cultivators of the Myriad Manifestations Sect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Duanmu Zhang spoke with a stern face: "Heavenly Principle is clear and exists within all things. The opening of The Great Learning states: 'Those who wished to make their thoughts sincere first extended their knowledge; the extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.' Therefore, the way to become a Sage lies in reading the books of the Sages extensively and investigating all things under heaven. Take filial piety as an example: one must study the Classic of Filial Piety and observe ancient rites before one can know how to act with filial piety. Thus, 'following the path of inquiry and study' comes first, and 'honoring the moral nature' comes after. Without investigating things, how can one know the Principle? Without knowing the Principle, how can one put it into practice?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Zhao Hansheng replied calmly: "What Mister Duanmu describes is seeking Principle externally, judging the Mind and the Principle as two separate things. May I ask, when one sees a child about to fall into a well, why does anyone immediately feel a 'heart of compassion'? This heart of compassion - how many things did you investigate and how many books did you read to obtain it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Duanmu Zhang fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Zhao Hansheng glanced at Chu Xuangui, Song Taosheng, and Li Guanyu in the hall, then continued: "The Mind is the Principle. Under heaven, can there be any matter or principle existing outside the Mind? That filial piety - did you investigate it from the body of a father? If the principle of filial piety resided in the father, then after the father passes away, would my mind then be devoid of the principle of filial piety? No! This principle of filial piety was originally within my heart; when it meets a father, it manifests as filial action. Therefore, the way of the Sage is sufficient within our own nature; it does not require external seeking. Seeking principles externally through the investigation of things is like riding a donkey to look for a donkey - there will always be a layer of separation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Chu Xuangui, Song Taosheng, and Li Guanyu were deeply shaken.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Duanmu Zhang huffed coldly: "Even if it is as you say, and the Principle is within the heart, human desires obscure the mind like dust on a bright mirror. Without broad learning, how can one polish the mirror and distinguish right from wrong?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Zhao Hansheng had been waiting for this and immediately said: "Well asked! This is precisely the world's greatest misunderstanding - separating knowledge from action. I ask you, Mister: if a person claims to know they should be filial to their parents, yet treats them with cruelty all day long, can we say he truly 'knows' filial piety?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"If someone 'knows' filial piety but does not 'act' with filial piety, then that is not true knowledge; it is merely knowing a few words and terms. True knowledge must lead to action; without action, it cannot be called knowledge. This is the 'Unity of Knowledge and Action'!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Duanmu Zhang fell silent again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">After a long while, he spoke slowly: "This 'Unity of Knowledge and Action' sounds simple, but it is too hollow. If everyone only sought their own 'Original Mind' and ignored the classics and the rites, would the world not fall into chaos? Governance requires precisely these external, unified standards and scholarship!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Zhao Hansheng spoke faster: "Mister Duanmu, 'Investigation of Things' has existed for how many years? Has it ever investigated into existence a single Sage for our Confucianism?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"How many scholars spend their whole lives studying the scriptures, talking about principles with great eloquence, yet once they become officials, corruption runs rampant? Once they encounter trouble, they shrink back. Is this not clear evidence of the severe severance between scholarship and life, between knowledge and action?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"I fully agree that governance needs standards. But where do these standards come from? Are they formulated out of thin air and forced upon people?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"The Great Learning says: 'If what is ordered is contrary to what the ruler likes, the people will not follow.' How can an official who does not have a sincere heart of filial piety within himself teach the people about filial piety? How can an official who does not have conscience as a judgment within his heart execute the laws justly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Therefore, one must attain conscience!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"There is no need to mimic the words and deeds of the Sages. Instead, one must work on one's own Original Mind as the Sages did."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Use the Innate Conscience of this Mind to respond to the infinite changes of the world!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">A deathly silence filled the hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Chu Xuangui, Song Taosheng, and Li Guanyu had completely forgotten their original purpose. Their faces were pale, immersed in deep shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Zhao Hansheng's new understanding of "Investigating things to extend knowledge" seemed to overturn the understanding of Confucianism they had held for their entire lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Even a Great Scholar like Duanmu Zhang, when faced with the fact that "investigating things for countless years has failed to produce a single Confucian Sage," had no choice but to fall into profound reflection.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
