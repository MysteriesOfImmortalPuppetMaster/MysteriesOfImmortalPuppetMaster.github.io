<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Blue Stone Cave Abode, cultivation chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Formation patterns flowed across the four walls, isolating this cultivation chamber from the outside world. Only a single blue lamp was lit within the room; its flickering flame illuminated Ning Zhuo’s quiet, composed face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He sat cross-legged on a prayer mat, a single thin sheet of paper floating before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The Luo Shu page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">It was neither gold nor jade, neither silk nor stone. It was as thin as a cicada's wing, yet it seemed to carry a weight comparable to a mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Zhuo took a deep breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Refining a Dao Artifact was no easy task.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">It had to be known that Ning Zhuo was merely a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo began to regulate his breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">In his Middle Dantian, a five-colored vortex spun slowly; Five Elements spiritual energy stood like a tornadic pillar, propping up the heavens and pressing down on the earth. In his Upper Dantian, countless mirror surfaces floated silently, with divine intent flowing ceaselessly within them. In his Lower Dantian, the blood pool churned, with blood veins intertwining and winding like vines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The Three Dantians operated simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo slowly extended his right hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">His five fingers were white as jade, gleaming with a faint luster under the lamplight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He inhaled deeply and gently pressed his palm against the Luo Shu page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Spirit Refinement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">In an instant, the youth's entire divine sea trembled violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Countless dots, divided into black and white, surged into his consciousness like a tidal wave. Each dot contained a massive amount of information - the numbers of the heaven and earth’s operation, the laws of the sun and moon’s rotation, the changes in stellar trajectories, and the principles of the birth and death of all things.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The information was too vast, too profound; it was simply not something a Foundation Establishment cultivator could withstand. The mirror surfaces of Ning Zhuo’s divine intent shattered one by one, his thoughts were consumed at a maddening rate, and his entire divine sea felt as if it were about to burst.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He couldn't help but let out a muffled groan as a trickle of fresh blood seeped from the corner of his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo did not let go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Magic Refinement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He drove his Five Elements spiritual energy to its limit, transforming it into a five-colored hand that flew out of his body and tightly gripped the Luo Shu page. The Five Elements generated one another in an endless cycle, penetrating the page layer by layer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Blood Refinement!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">At the same time, the blood pool in his Lower Dantian surged, transforming into a stream of blood qi. The blood qi spread, condensing into countless tiny blood veins that covered the surface of the Luo Shu page. Each blood vein squirmed like a living creature, initiating an corruption of the page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Spirit Refinement, Magic Refinement, Blood Refinement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ordinary cultivators usually employed one method of refinement, but since Ning Zhuo cultivated the Upper, Middle, and Lower Dantians simultaneously, he could execute three types of refinement at once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Three Dantians, three forces, refining the Dao Artifact simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">But even so, Ning Zhuo felt the strain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The power of the Dao Artifact was too strong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">His face grew paler and paler, beads of fine sweat seeped from his forehead, and his fingers began to tremble slightly. The Luo Shu page vibrated violently in his palm, as if it would break free at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Little Zhuo, I'll help you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">It was Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Formally refining a Dao Artifact was a major event fraught with difficulties. Naturally, Sun Lingtong had come personally to assist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Round after round of stealing techniques were unleashed by Sun Lingtong, covering the Luo Shu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo immediately felt the pressure lessen significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The refinement was able to continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun Lingtong’s face quickly turned pale, and a nosebleed flowed silently. He gritted his teeth, not making a sound, and continued to cast his techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo’s eyes were wide open, his eyeballs filled with bloodshot veins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Three Dantians operated at full capacity. Five Elements spiritual energy, Mirror Platform divine consciousness, and Demonic Contamination essence blood - the three forces poured madly into the Luo Shu page regardless of the cost.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The page trembled violently. Black and white dots constantly emerged, impacting Ning Zhuo’s divine sea. Jade light flowed across the page, resisting the spiritual energy and demonic blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The duo of Sun and Ning had given their all right from the start, yet they had only refined thirty percent, and both were already reaching their limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"What do we do?" Ning Zhuo frowned deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">This was his first time obtaining a Dao Artifact, and his first time attempting to refine one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Although he was well-read, books did not contain instructions on how a Foundation Establishment cultivator should refine a Dao Artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Could it be that after all the hardships to obtain the Luo Shu page, we actually have no way to truly make it our own?" Sun Lingtong’s confidence was also shaking violently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Magic Artifacts, Magic Treasures, Spirit Treasures, Dao Artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Dao Artifacts were a tier above Spirit Treasures; their level was indeed incredibly high. For Ning Zhuo, with his mere Foundation Establishment cultivation, refining it was naturally extremely difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Just as they were about to fail, a voice suddenly echoed in the depths of Ning Zhuo’s heart: "Foolish child, the Luo Shu is the source of mathematics and logic. How can you refine it by force? If this were not originally your mother’s possession, and if it did not sense the bloodline connection between you and me, you wouldn't have been able to refine even half a percent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo was shaken to his core, overjoyed: "Mother, you’ve woken up?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">But that voice dissipated like an illusion, as if it had never appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Having received the hint, Ning Zhuo’s eyes burst with a sharp gleam.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He understood!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"The Luo Shu is the source of mathematics and logic. I must understand it to refine it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">He calmed his mind and first probed the massive quantity of black and white dots in the divine sea of his Upper Dantian.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Observing carefully, he immediately discovered that the flow of these black and white dots faintly resembled the trajectory of the Five Elements generating one another. Metal generates Water, Water generates Wood, Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal - every generation caused a reorganization of the dots; every clash caused a separation of the dots.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Principle of the Five Elements!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Metal is White; the dots condensed like stars, representing "Four and Nine" in the numerology of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Water is Black; the dots flowed like rivers, representing "One and Six" in the numerology of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Wood is Green; the dots sprouted like grass and trees, representing "Three and Eight" in the numerology of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Fire is Red; the dots rose like raging flames, representing "Two and Seven" in the numerology of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Earth is Yellow; the dots were heavy as mountains, representing "Five and Ten" in the numerology of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The Five Elements circulated, and the numbers generated one another. Every dot in the Luo Shu corresponded to a Five Elements attribute; every change followed the laws of the Five Elements' generation and inhibition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Through this understanding, the massive number of dots transformed from black and white into the five colors of the Five Elements: Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">These five-colored dots were all influenced by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">With a sudden flash of insight, Ning Zhuo immediately mobilized these dots, causing them to merge into his Five Elements spiritual energy one after another, finally converging into the five-colored hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Bolstered by this powerful aid, the five-colored hand immediately underwent a qualitative change. It brazenly broke through the bottleneck and continued the process of refining the Luo Shu with astonishing efficiency - at least ten times faster than before!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The Five Elements realm, the Ice realm, his Renowned Artisan-level artifact refining realm, his Master-level array formation realm, his Master-level mechanism technique realm...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">These realms of expertise helped Ning Zhuo understand the principles of the Luo Shu, turning the abstract into the concrete, and transforming concise summaries into detailed, rich examples.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Spirit Refinement, Magic Refinement, Blood Refinement - the three refinement methods underwent qualitative changes in succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">One stick of incense worth of time later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The trembling of the Luo Shu page ceased, becoming completely calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">In Ning Zhuo’s divine sea, the surviving black and white dots no longer flowed madly. Instead, they silently condensed, outlining the form of the page.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">A profound and mysterious connection was established between Ning Zhuo and the Luo Shu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">It was not a master-servant connection, but a connection of "resonance" - he understood the Luo Shu, and the Luo Shu accepted him. From this day forth, he could unleash the full power of the Luo Shu and master a computational power far exceeding his own limits!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"It’s done! Hahaha." Sun Lingtong placed his hands on his hips and threw his head back to laugh. However, the movement was too vigorous; his vision went black, and he nearly toppled over backward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Throughout the entire refinement process, he had exhausted himself, utilizing various stealing techniques to provide immense help to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"Yes, it is done," Ning Zhuo murmured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The page remained as white as jade, but in the depths of his heart, it was completely different. Those black and white dots were no longer chaotic but orderly; those flowing trajectories were no longer hazy and variable but clearly visible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This was now his Luo Shu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="159"/>
<paragraph index="161">The time had come. Zhao Hansheng ascended the high platform once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Dressed in green robes, his face thin and eccentric, he was surrounded by a faint, intangible Literary Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">His gaze swept over the dark mass of people below the stage, and Zhao Hansheng nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">His gaze paused imperceptibly on Ning Zhuo for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Everyone was looking forward with anticipation, knowing that today was Zhao Hansheng’s final public lecture on Mind Study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Zhao Hansheng began to speak. His voice was not loud, yet it traveled clearly into everyone's ears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The crowd below listened with rapt attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo was no exception. His eyes narrowed slightly, and his divine consciousness operated at full capacity, firmly memorizing every single word Zhao Hansheng said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Traditional Confucian cultivators emphasized "Extending Knowledge through the Investigation of Things," seeking principles outwardly; Mind Study, however, advocated that "The Mind is Principle," seeking answers inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After several consecutive lectures, this point no longer shocked the cultivators; it only immersed them further into Mind Study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Some looked thoughtful, some frowned in deep contemplation, and some nodded frequently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">After two hours, the lecture drew to a close.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">It was time for the open question-and-answer session.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo took the initiative to ask a question, and the Confucian cultivator on duty, seeing him stand up, immediately granted permission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Everyone's gazes focused on him, their expressions turning somewhat subtle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo’s reputation had soared recently, largely by stepping over Gu Qing. And since Gu Qing was Zhao Hansheng’s prized student, the tension between Ning Zhuo and the teacher-student pair was well known to all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Therefore, the moment Ning Zhuo stood up, he attracted the attention of the entire venue. Everyone looked forward to Ning Zhuo’s question, and even more so to Zhao Hansheng’s response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Zhao Hansheng’s gaze fell upon Ning Zhuo, his expression calm. "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, what doubts do you have?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ning Zhuo cupped his fists in salute, looked straight into Zhao Hansheng’s eyes, and spoke slowly: "This junior is bold enough to ask Sir - how exactly does one cultivate the Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Countless gazes darted back and forth between Ning Zhuo and Zhao Hansheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Some were excited, some curious, some gloating, and some watched coldly from the sidelines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Zhao Hansheng fell silent for a moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He knew very well that if he did not give a correct response, it would inevitably weaken his own reputation, and even his credibility.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">And this reputation and credibility were things he had accumulated through painstaking effort and numerous public lectures over these past days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action requires a Confucian foundation; telling him wouldn't matter, Zhao Hansheng pondered. He knew Ning Zhuo was not a pure Confucian cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action came from Mind Study and was a newly created technique, existing only in a Confucian version. Unlike techniques such as "Head Hanging from a Beam" or "Thigh Pricked with an Awl" - which had ancient versions suitable for almost all cultivators - this had a Confucian version intended only for Confucian scholars to execute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">But Zhao Hansheng still harbored doubts in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">This was not the first time Ning Zhuo had asked for instruction on the Unity of Knowledge and Action. But last time...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Zhao Hansheng remembered it vividly - his jade pendant had vibrated, warning him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">What if I proclaim the Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The thought arose in Zhao Hansheng’s mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">And in that instant, the jade pendant hanging at his waist vibrated once again!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Zhao Hansheng’s pupils constricted slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Of course, his expression remained as calm as water, revealing no emotion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">After a moment of silence, Zhao Hansheng spoke slowly, his voice remaining composed: "The Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action... this technique is a secret transmission of Mind Study, not something that can be explained in a few words. Although this old man knows a thing or two, I dare not claim mastery. If Little Friend is interested, you might as well start with the Instructions for Practical Living. After reading it through, we can discuss it further."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"Sir," Ning Zhuo said again, "This junior has already read the Instructions for Practical Living thoroughly. However, it only speaks of the principle, not the method. This junior is dull-witted and does not know how to transform the principle into a method. I implore Sir for guidance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo naturally wasn't willing to let this opportunity slip by easily and pressed on relentlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Zhao Hansheng took a light breath, shifting his gaze into the distance to look at the faraway peaks before bringing it back to rest on Ning Zhuo. He said gently, "Little Friend is naturally intelligent; why be obsessed with a single method? When the principle is understood, the method becomes clear naturally. Little Friend might as well read it a few more times and contemplate it carefully; perhaps you will gain your own insights."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Then, without waiting for Ning Zhuo to press further, he waved his sleeve slightly: "Next."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The crowd below couldn't help but whisper among themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Zhao Hansheng’s clearly perfunctory answer caused their impression of him to plummet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Despite Zhao Hansheng acting as a role model and putting on an air of a selfless expert, when it came to a personal grudge, he would still be petty!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Zhao Hansheng sighed inwardly, having long anticipated the crowd's reaction. It could be said that Ning Zhuo’s question had dissolved at least thirty percent of the results he had achieved over these past days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">But the jade pendant had warned him again; Zhao Hansheng knew he had to take it seriously!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Although he didn't know the underlying reason why teaching Ning Zhuo would trigger a warning, between two evils, he chose the lesser one. Zhao Hansheng did not hesitate to brush off Ning Zhuo’s question once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Sigh!!!" Ning Zhuo sighed deeply in his heart and could only sit back down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Although he knew hope was slim this time, actually having it fall through still left him feeling somewhat disappointed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The Art of the Unity of Knowledge and Action was very useful to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Even the Confucian cultivator version had immense reference value. In the future, it might be possible to modify the technique and complete a version he could use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Of course, Ning Zhuo’s current foundation was too weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"But as long as I absorb some high-grade Confucian demonic souls, these problems can be fundamentally solved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Thinking of Confucian demonic souls, Ning Zhuo thought of Qin De.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The Confucian cultivators were also discussing Qin De.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"The Saint's Great Thief Sutra uses the name of a Saint to commit the acts of a great thief. He read through all the Confucian classics, yet extracted such an evil book from them." Duanmu Zhang let out a deep sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Situ Gu said, "Qin De’s Saint's Great Thief Sutra has a core argument that 'The Saint is the greatest thief.' He found countless examples in the classics to prove that the sages of past generations were all 'stealing' heavenly principles, the hearts of the people, and destiny. This set of twisted logic and fallacies is indeed very difficult to refute using our traditional Confucian theoretical knowledge."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"However, Mind Study emphasizes seeking inward, extending one's conscience. This is completely opposite to Qin De’s 'stealing from the outside.' I believe that if we can invite Zhao Hansheng to debate Qin De, he will be able to crush him head-on theoretically!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Song Taosheng added, "And once he is defeated, the obstacles shackling the development of our Confucian cultivator group will be swept away."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Although Zhao Hansheng publicly refusing Ning Zhuo’s request for instruction had damaged his reputation greatly, in the eyes of Duanmu Zhang, Situ Gu, and the converted Song Taosheng, these were minor details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The development of the Confucian cultivator group within the Myriad Manifestations Sect’s main gate was the major issue!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Discussions like this had actually been going on for several rounds already.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Today was Zhao Hansheng’s final public lecture, and also the moment for the Confucian cultivators to make their decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Go find Zhao Hansheng!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
