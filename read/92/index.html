<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 92: Investigating Ning Zhuo</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Ning Clan patriarch had already been quite curious about the recently-risen Ning Zhuo. After reviewing the numerous reports, he said with some relief, “So that child Ning Zhuo had already revealed some mechanical arts talent early on.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The very first report stated the following: Ning Zhuo’s mother, Meng Yaoyin, was herself a mechanical arts cultivator. Although she passed away early on, she left behind many texts on mechanical arts. Ning Zhuo treated these texts as relics from his mother and cherished them deeply, often falling asleep while holding them to his chest. As he grew older, he was increasingly influenced by the words written within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">From a young age, Ning Zhuo displayed a strong interest in mechanical arts. He frequently visited Children’s Garden to watch Li Leifeng’s[^1] puppet shows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Children’s Garden was an orphanage in Fire Persimmon Immortal City that sheltered homeless children. It was jointly funded by the City Lord Mansion and the city’s various prominent clans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This was a national policy of Southern Bean Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Li Leifeng was the director of Children’s Garden, the holder of a thunder spirit root, and also a mechanical arts cultivator. He had created a mechanical pagoda that could draw lightning from the environment and convert it to energy without using up spirit power. In battle, the lightning stored within the mechanical pagoda would erupt outward, forming lightning whips or chains that locked down and electrocuted his enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Elder Li’s puppet shows are truly outstanding.” The Ning Clan patriarch gave sincere praise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He had watched Li Leifeng’s performances before. All of them were utterly captivating!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Perhaps influenced by Li Leifeng, Ning Zhuo held a deep fondness for puppets and similar toys from a young age. His favorite toys were the one-wheel, double-leg, and triple-hair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">When he entered the clan academy, his favorite subject was mechanical arts. He studied diligently and asked many questions, even to the point of neglecting the other subjects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">It wasn’t until after the age of ten that his performance in all subjects gradually improved, and his general scores rose from low to mid and high-grade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Ning Clan focused on talismans. Ning Zhuo’s aunt and uncle naturally did not want him to walk down a deviant path and ruin his future. They disciplined him strictly, smashing more than three large baskets full of mechanical toys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">But although Ning Zhuo seemed to hold himself back from then on, he did everything he could to study mechanical arts in secret. He even went so far as to take on jobs in mechanical workshops, laboring without pay even as a child. For him, simply interacting with mechanical constructs brought him great joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Perhaps because of his persistence and passion, Ning Zhuo’s proficiency in mechanical arts steadily grew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">At the age of fifteen, Ning Zhuo created a mechanical parrot that far surpassed what all his peers could produce. An elder at the academy saw it and immediately gave praise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">But even though certain elders had placed some small expectations on him, Ning Zhuo ended up performing poorly in the clan’s grand examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“He was too nervous!” The Ning Clan patriarch looked at a jade slip and sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">This jade slip recorded the scene of Ning Zhuo’s class taking the clan examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“Yes,” Ning Xiaoren agreed. “At the time, the control string was accidentally tangled, and Ning Zhuo didn’t notice. When it came time to perform, the tangled string left him with no chance of success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Had I been the proctor, I would definitely have made an exception and permitted Ning Zhuo to retake the exam.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Ning Clan patriarch shook his head. “The proctoring elder made no mistakes. According to the rules, it is the examinee’s duty to check everything beforehand. Since such a thing happened, Ning Zhuo was the one at fault.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">As the father and son were discussing, a servant came to report that Feng Jiqing[^2] had arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Let him in,” the Ning Clan patriarch nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Feng Jiqing was a middle-aged man with narrow eyes. He had long black hair and a tall and slender build, and a windmill-like blade wheel was strapped to his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Feng Jiqing had a wind spirit root and was somewhat proficient in mechanical arts. Although not an orthodox mechanical arts cultivator, the mechanical wind falcons he had created were as fast as lightning and as fierce as a storm. Under his control, they were extremely sharp weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Ning Clan had failed to recruit Hanging-Hair Traveler, but never gave up on pulling in outside talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Recently, after increasing their investment into outside talents, the Ning Clan finally succeeded in recruiting Feng Jiqing. To date, he was the clan’s most significant acquisition in terms of mechanical arts talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Patriarch, junior patriarch,” Feng Jiqing cupped his hands in greeting, standing with his back straight. As a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator, and knowing the present value of his mechanical arts skill, he carried himself with pride, only showing mild deference for the two Ning Clan leaders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Junior Patriarch Ning Xiaoren smiled. “Master Feng, we’ve invited you here to take a look at these two explosive fire monkeys and assess the skills of the person who crafted them.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The patriarch and junior patriarch had no plans of exposing Ning Zhuo’s identity as the true creator of the explosive fire monkey just yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">On the one hand, Ning Xiaoren still planned on feigning ignorance to improve his image and make Ning Zhuo feel his “sincerity”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">On the other, this matter was tied to Fei Si. If word got out, Fei Si would be placed in a difficult position. Offending Fei Si like this wasn’t worth it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After all, Fei Si was the one who handled most of Fire Persimmon Immortal City’s daily affairs. He was a powerful official and certainly not one to be trifled with.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">This concealment unintentionally led to a misunderstanding on Feng Jiqing’s part. He subconsciously guessed, “Could it be that the Ning Clan wants to offer a high price to hire Chen Cha?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Naturally, Feng Jiqing had no desire to see such a thing happen. Keeping his little thoughts to himself, he began examining the two explosive fire monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">One of the mechanical monkeys had been carefully crafted with solid materials. It was the first version. The other was crudely made and already heavily damaged; this was one of the latter monkeys produced after Ning Zhuo revised the blueprint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">After inspecting them, Feng Jiqing said, “The main material of the monkey’s skin is the hide of the fire velvet rat, woven using traditional spirit embroidery. It’s an orthodox craft and nothing worth mentioning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Unsurprisingly, sky gold is used for the skeleton. Sky gold is generally considered the best material when you need to engrave storage formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“But if it were me, I would go a step further and use the void lungs of a cloud whale. With those, the embedded formation would gain the ability to store living beings. As it is now, it can only store inanimate objects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“The explosive fire monkey is a mechanism designed for harvesting fire persimmons. Although fire persimmons can to some extent be considered fire essence, at their core they are still organic matter – the fruits of the fire persimmon trees. It’s better to put them in a storage formation that can contain living things, as that will preserve their flavor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Feng Jiqing only pointed out the advantages of his personal suggestion and never once mentioned how rare a cloud whale’s void lungs were.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“The material used for the body isn’t bad.” One of the explosive fire monkey’s most impressive features was glossed over by Feng Jiqing with a single sentence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“There are many formations embedded in the hands, and their arrangement is relatively novel. Not bad.” Feng Jiqing had no choice but to give some praise, but he still kept it as short as possible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“The stroll bullets in the brain are the most brilliant part of this mechanical monkey’s design.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">After giving a quick compliment, Feng Jiqing immediately turned things around and said, “However, while this choice cuts costs significantly, it also means that it can’t be used by anyone below Foundation Establishment, which locks out a huge portion of the potential customer base.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“If not for this flaw, the sales of the explosive fire monkey would have been several times higher, maybe even over tenfold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“All in all, this design has its shortcomings,” Feng Jiqing concluded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Ning Clan patriarch and Ning Xiaoren exchanged a glance. The former remained silent, while the latter asked, “Since that’s the case, how skilled would you say the creator is in terms of mechanical arts?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Of the hundred arts of cultivation, mechanical arts ranked at the bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Ning father and son had no real understanding of this subject. As leaders of the clan, they were always either busy with clan affairs or caught up in power struggles, making it hard for them to properly judge the merits of the explosive fire monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">In truth, let alone a mechanical construct, they wouldn’t even be able to evaluate a newly created pill recipe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">They weren’t alchemists nor mechanical arts specialists.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In ancient times, things had been different. Foundation Establishment cultivators were rare, clans were generally weaker than sects, and cultivation nations were truly scarce, to the point of being almost completely absent from the earliest historical records.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">But now, alongside the development of the cultivation world, the hundred arts of cultivation had grown vast and complex. For most cultivators, exploring outside their specialty was like hiking up a mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Feng Jiqing was thoughtful for a while before saying, “Chen Cha ran the Flying Disk Workshop for so many years before finally squeezing out a mechanical construct like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“That alone can prove how difficult it was.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“This mechanical construct indeed has some clever ideas, but not too many. Even though it’s selling like hotcakes right now, the fire persimmon harvesting business will likely enter a slump next year, and its other uses are limited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“All things considered, this mechanical construct can be considered mid-grade, leaning slightly toward high-grade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“As for the creator, I have nothing more to say.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Ning Clan patriarch and Ning Xiaoren exchanged another glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The patriarch thought, “Feng Jiqing is a Foundation Establishment cultivator. A rating of ‘mid-grade’ from him is already high praise for the Qi Refining Ning Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">As for Ning Xiaoren, he became even more determined to win Ning Zhuo over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Meanwhile, in Children’s Care Center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Zhu Xuanji concealed his presence and entered the premises.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Inside, an old man was sunbathing. Suddenly, he furrowed his brows and looked toward the concealed Zhu Xuanji. “Who’s there?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Zhu Xuanji was taken aback for a moment, then revealed himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">He formed a hand seal, and golden light flashed in his eyes as he activated a detection spell to observe the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“So that’s it. Faint currents of electricity flow around this courtyard, creating an invisible electric field. The moment I stepped in, the shift in electrical potential gave me away.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Zhu Xuanji spoke some words of praise before stomping on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">A burst of lightning erupted beneath his foot, blowing away a layer of dirt and exposing a brick underneath, which was inscribed with dazzling runes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Similar bricks were laid at regular intervals underground, although they didn’t form a formation proper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">And it was precisely because they didn’t form a formation that Zhu Xuanji failed to detect them initially. Ever since arriving in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, this was the first time someone discovered him while he was hiding himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“So it’s Sir Zhu Xuanji. Please, take a seat.” The old man remained leaned back in his chair and didn’t move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Zhu Xuanji had already made a public appearance. Everyone in Fire Persimmon Immortal City knew about him by now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Strangely enough, even though the old man was only at the early stage of Foundation Establishment, he was completely unruffled in the presence of the Golden Core stage Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But Zhu Xuanji wasn’t the least bit offended. Smiling, he walked over to the old man and said, “Senior Li Leifeng, this junior has long heard of your great name. I’ve come this time specifically to meet you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Li Leifeng snorted coldly. “To meet an old relic like me? Divine Investigator Zhu, you sure took your time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“You say you came to meet me, but what you really want to do is verify whether or not I’m that black shadow demonic cultivator, isn’t that right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Zhu Xuanji smiled awkwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Li Leifeng sighed. “I’ve lived a long life and seen many things. Sir Zhu, investigate as you please.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zhu Xuanji cupped his hands. “Forgive my offense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">[^1]: Li Leifeng – 李雷峰 – Li is a very common surname, meaning “plum”. Lei means “thunder/lightning”, and Feng means (mountain) peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">[^2]: Feng Jiqing – 风继轻 – Feng means “wind”. Ji can mean “to inherit” and Qing can mean “insignificant” or “light”</paragraph><br/><br/>
