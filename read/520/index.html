<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Thousand Peak Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Frontline camp of the allied forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">“Stop!” Chen Lingfeng grabbed the two cultivators who were trying to sneak away and demanded in a harsh tone, “Are you trying to go pick up and salvage the spoils from the battlefield?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The two who were caught were flustered for a moment, then their expressions hardened immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">One of them directly denied, “Of course not! We are going to scout the battlefield, waiting for an opportunity to inflict casualties on the other troops from the Two Note Nation that rushed here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The other one gritted his teeth and said, “Chen Lingfeng, you have no evidence; do not go spouting lies!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Chen Lingfeng sneered coldly, and was about to speak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">A cultivator’s figure, like washed ink soaked into rice paper, quickly solidified, reverting into a dashing Nascent Soul cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Seeing this Nascent Soul cultivator, the two cultivators blocked by Chen Lingfeng could not help but show signs of nervousness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Army Strategist Lu.” One of them saluted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The other one said through gritted teeth, “Great Cave Master Lu, the two of us were just about to proactively launch an attack, but Chen Lingfeng blocked us and wouldn’t let us go. Is your appearance this time also meant to stop us from fighting?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Chen Lingfeng, seeing that the two were turning the accusation against him, immediately became furious, “Bastards….”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Lu Hongtu reached out to stop him, and instead smiled as he looked toward the two leaving the camp: “You two go ahead and act as you see fit.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Chen Lingfeng glared, “Army Master Lu, how can this be allowed? These are already the seventh group of people leaving. If you do not stop them, then there will be no one in the main camp who can take control of the situation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Lu Hongtu smiled slightly and slowly shook his head, “I was appointed as a strategist because Lord Long values my counsel, only to provide suggestions; never to impose orders on others.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“All of you are members of the Thousand Peak Forest; you are either distant friends or close neighbors. Since Lord Long has not issued any orders to restrict everyone, why make things difficult now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Upon hearing this, the two cultivators heaved a sigh of relief, lavishly praised Lu Hongtu, and then declared that they absolutely intended to go into battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Lu Hongtu, not wanting to listen to their lies, waved his hand at them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The two immediately left the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Chen Lingfeng watched the figures of the two leaving, his eagle eyes as cold as ice, “I bet these two are definitely going to the battlefield to pick up the spoils of war.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Lu Hongtu smiled without speaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Chen Lingfeng, agitated, said, “If Lord Long returns and sees that the various strong individuals in our camp have fled, how are we going to account for it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Lu Hongtu laughed heartily, “Calm down, calm down!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Chen Lingfeng shook his head repeatedly, unwilling to speak more with Lu Hongtu, and turned away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Lu Hongtu, his gaze somber, slowly paced, left the camp, and walked up a nearby hill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The distant mountains lay quietly, the mountain ridges winding and undulating, layers upon layers of green being bathed in a soft radiance by the sunlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The mountain wind gently brushed by, leaves rustled, and occasionally a few mountain sparrows flitted among the trees, breaking the brief silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He took a deep breath; the air in the mountains was fresh, yet carried a trace of inexplicable oppression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">In Lu Hongtu’s mind, the great battle from six days ago surfaced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The scenes of the fierce fight between the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and Du Tiechuan were deeply imprinted in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Lu Hongtu, his eyes still somber, said, “The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King suffered a minor defeat; although it did not cause the alliance to crumble, it did scatter people’s hearts, and now some have begun to seek their own fortunes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Many cultivators had risked entering the battlefield to pick up the spoils of war; it was a sign of everyone seeking their own fortune.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“When the wind is in your favor it’s fine, but once it turns, the lack of unity within the alliance and everyone’s selfish desires will become apparent.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Just then, a figure appeared silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The unfamiliar cultivator who appeared saluted Lu Hongtu, and then secretly reported the intelligence he had gathered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">After listening, Lu Hongtu couldn’t help but furrow his brows slightly, “Have you not yet obtained any information about the Old Stone Monster?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The reporting cultivator showed an expression of shame, and stated that his group of several dozen had been making every effort to search and probe, but the Old Stone Monster had vanished as if it had suddenly evaporated, and no matter how they searched, they could not find him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Lu Hongtu nodded slightly and waved off the reporting cultivator, “Go down and continue probing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Left alone again, he stood on the hilltop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">A gust of cool mountain wind brushed over his tense face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">His gaze fixed on a patch of clouds above the distant mountains, and he fell into deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“The Old Stone Monster’s unpredictable movements are the most troublesome thing of all.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“He is at the Soul Formation Stage! He is the biggest variable that can affect this battle.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“Next, will he appear on the battlefield?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">“According to his recent performance, a considerable amount of Soul Formation level treasure materials have been left behind on the battlefield. This must be a huge temptation for the Old Stone Monster.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Lu Hongtu returned to the main camp, and saw the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth boasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“We infiltrated the battlefield and picked up several strands of Ginseng Dragon Whiserks.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Look, this type of Ginseng dragon blood is extremely rare; every drop is the finest raw material for making healing pills!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The white-robed ghost cultivator Tian Shuang and the black-robed ghost cultivator Di Hui, in front of the strong cultivators, flaunted their harvest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Lu Hongtu, seeing this scene, immediately stepped into the meeting tent of the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He smiled slightly, “Fellow Daoists of the Soul Devouring Sect, you two, having come here deliberately to proclaim this, what is your purpose? Please speak it out. Perhaps we can cooperate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The other cultivators, upon seeing that it was Lu Hongtu, all smiled or nodded in greeting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">In the early days of the allied forces’ formation, it was Lu Hongtu who recruited people everywhere. During the clashes, Lu Hongtu repeatedly came up with tactics and indeed achieved results. Just now, Lu Hongtu did not follow Chen Lingfeng’s suggestion, and instead let go of the two cultivators who had slipped away to the battlefield to loot spoils, thereby winning everyone’s favor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, upon seeing Lu Hongtu, also nodded slightly. The two also had a good impression of Lu Hongtu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The two ghost cultivators exchanged a glance. Di Hui, being rather impatient by nature, said, “Fellow Lu, you speak directly; then the two of us will not hold anything back and will just say it straight.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Di Hui described the specific situation, which immediately triggered an uproar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“I didn’t hear it wrong, did I? Is it really True Glazed Heartblood?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“This is the vital blood of earth-element demon cultivators. Left behind by the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, it must certainly be of the Soul Formation level.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Not only that True Glazed Heartblood, but also Ginseng Root wall earth. This soil is extremely fertile, full of vitality, and is an excellent base for spiritual plants.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“But what exactly is that huge dragon-shaped talisman that the white-robed ghost spoke of?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">An experienced elder explained, “It should be the dragon vein inscription.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“The enemy this time employed the Iron Flow Leveling the Plains military strategy, with huge energy consumption; Du Tiechuan did not hesitate to mobilize the dragon veins of the Two Note Nation to infuse energy into the parade platform.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Therefore, the Iron Flow Leveling the Plains naturally carries the great power of the dragon veins.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Du Tiechuan and his heavy-armored main force, pushing in a sweeping manner and rolling in, meant that the dragon veins were simultaneously advancing in a massive surge.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Especially in the places where he clashed with the Dragon King, the power of the dragon veins continuously erupted, eroding the surrounding environment, leaving behind dragon vein inscriptions.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Of course, what is left on the battlefield is only a part of the inscriptions, just individual dragon-shaped runes.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Along the path of the main force’s rampage, there must also be individual dragon-shaped runes hidden.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“We must find these runes and strip them away from the earth veins of the Thousand Peak Forest!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Although the Thousand Peak Forest is the territory of the Two Note nation, the Two Note Nation has always lacked control over it, because the mountains, rivers, and so on here have all been occupied by various indigenous deities and have not been integrated into the national dragon veins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The dragon vein runes combine to form dragon vein inscriptions; once these inscriptions mark and permeate the mountains and rivers of the Thousand Peaks Forest, they will diminish the authority and power of the local deities, eventually absorbing the entire Thousand Peak Forest into themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The assembled cultivators, with solemn expressions, upon hearing the explanation, all declared that they wished to contribute to the Thousand Peaks Forest, and went off to search for the dragon vein runes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Everyone’s enthusiasm was completely mobilized, because the dragon vein runes were also a rare treasure, of high value and with unique uses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Soon, a large wave of cultivators left the tent, all rushing out of the camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Chen Lingfeng was so angry that his face turned pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Lu Hongtu watched the backs of the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth as they immediately left, his gaze somber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Chen Lingfeng sent his divine sense to communicate, “Lu Hongtu, it’s over now, there are less than ten people remaining. If Lord Long returns, you answer his questioning!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Lu Hongtu smiled, lightly clapped his hands, “Everyone, next, let us discuss the plan to attack the following troops of the Two Note Nation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“At present, the Two Note Nation’ main heavy-armored armies are all busy stripping off their iron skin and meat armor, and are in a stage of recuperation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“The following troops of the Two Note Nation consist of those who did not meet the selection criteria and were brushed aside. We need to completely annihilate this force!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“If we allow them to merge together, it would be a dereliction of our duty.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Lu Hongtu’s proposal was completely approved by the cultivators who remained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">These people were almost all barbarian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Compared to the evil demonic deviants and the freewheeling demon cultivators who ran into the Thousand Peak Forest from outside to hide, the indigenous core of the Thousand Peak Forest were barbarian cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">The deities worshipped by the barbarians were also the stubborn defenders who monopolized the mountains and waters of the Thousand Peak Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">These people were the most loyal and reliable backbone forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">“However, even if we manage to completely wipe out the subsequent troops, it would be nothing more than mere drumming on the side.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“The true key to this great battle remains the contest of the Soul Formation Powerhouses.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">“Old Stone Monster, it’s now up to your actions!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Lu Hongtu had a clear and deep understanding of the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">At the edge of the grand battle’s battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The mechanical dragon shrank to a small size, hiding in a dense canopy of trees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sun Lingtong, excitedly, took out the corpse of the Old Stone Monster, “Next, it’s time for us to act.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">However, in the very next moment, Ning Zhuo’s finger felt pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Mechanical finger ring!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">“Huh?!” Ning Zhuo was instantly startled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The mechanical finger ring contracted with an unprecedented force, nearly making him feel as if it would break his finger bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">“Wait a moment!” Ning Zhuo immediately called out, stopping Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Sun Lingtong looked at him in confusion, and then saw Ning Zhuo raise his palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The mechanical finger ring contracted fiercely, compressing Ning Zhuo’s finger into a deformed shape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo, not only bound by a life-and-death friendship but also well acquainted with the ins and outs of the mechanical finger ring, immediately had their pupils contract as they speculated, “The mechanical finger ring is giving a warning? Is it telling us that if we continue this action, we will suffer a serious misfortune?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo looked at the mechanical finger ring, “I think it would be more prudent not to deploy it again as the Old Stone Monster.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">As if sensing the change in Ning Zhuo’s intent, the mechanical finger ring immediately returned to its original state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Sun Lingtong’s face turned solemn, no longer in a frivolous mood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">With his quick mind, he immediately realized the key, “Oh, I understand now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">“Our previous events on Bikong Mountain have probably been leaked.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">“That Void Evil God Bone is an even more obscure existence; being able to be stored there for many years without anyone knowing about this secret, thus the Old Stone Monster will be estimated as a Soul Formation level being.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo nodded, and then continued, “Originally, the campaign in the Thousand Peak Forest was merely a contest between the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and Du Tiechuan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">“Although there was the Soul Formation level national beast, the two-headed badger, the previous battle had already shown that it was not key.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Therefore, the Soul Formation level demon cultivator Old Stone Monster, who had always remained on the sidelines, has become an existence that both sides, friend and foe, are wary of!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Sun Lingtong sighed, “The Old Stone Monster and the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King have similar origins, and the former also has the widely circulated history of devouring fragments of the treasure rock.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“Once we take on that role and run into the battlefield, it might end up that Du Tiechuan and the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King will successively target us!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">At this point in their exchange, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo both broke out in cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">“In that case, although the previous battle between Du Tiechuan and the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King was fierce and every move was bloody, they still held back to some extent.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">“After all, they have also been guarding against the Old Stone Monster.” “Could it be that the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King’s retreat was partly for show?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">“And then there’s Du Tiechuan, who after the battle built a massive military camp, then announced a period of seclusion for recuperation, only occasionally issuing military orders. He, too, is waiting for the rabbit by the tree, right?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">At this point, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong looked at each other, and for a moment, were speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">After a while, Ning Zhuo obediently returned to Liu Er and Zhang Hei’s side, and together with them, harvested the Ginseng Dragon Whiserks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Thus, three days passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">“Dragon blood, such a huge pool of Ginseng dragon blood.” Under a pile of broken stones, Luo Xiwei, using the earth tunneling technique, crept in, his expression extremely excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He was a demon cultivator, wielding a five-section staff, and was proficient in earth-based magic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Even before the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth publicized that there were great treasures hidden on the battlefield, he had already sneakily infiltrated the battlefield to reap benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The earth-yellow Ginseng dragon blood seeped deep underground, contaminating a stone, causing its surface to emit a soft, precious glow, and even the hard stone became pliable, even possessing some elasticity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Luo Xiwei terminated his earth tunneling technique, and just as he was about to reach out his hand to take it,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Suddenly, a ray of icy light pierced through the layers of broken stones, with speed like lightning, and struck him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Luo Xiwei had no time to react at all, and was frozen in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">He widened his eyes, a look of terror frozen on his face, completely immobilized by the thick layer of ice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Northern Abyss Rapid Freezing Light!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">At the edge of the military camp, the cold light of a watchtower slowly extinguished. Just now, from its top a beam of white light had been emitted, freezing to death the Golden Core cultivator Luo Xiwei.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">For a moment, the cultivators both inside and outside the camp were shaken, all casting probing glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">In the next moment, a thread of flame made a circle in mid-air, agilely darting into the pile of broken stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Soon, a piercing, miserable wail was heard from a cultivator who was burned to death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Death-Parting Fire!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">This was a fierce attack launched from another watchtower.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">After the cultivators recovered their senses, there was an uproar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">The cultivators of the Thousand Peak Forest, frightened, fled wildly by various means.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">One beam of white light after another shot out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Meanwhile, strands of flame circled through the air, seeking out and pursuing enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Many cultivators of the Thousand Peak Forest, due to their own greed, paid the price with their lives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">That night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Du Tiechuan, who received the military report, had a worried expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">He did not regard these battle results as significant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">“The real key is still the Old Stone Monster.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“Since it did not appear, then that’s all there is to it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Du Tiechuan coughed twice, each time spitting out earthen yellow blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">He waved his sleeve and completely closed the door of the secret chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Having delayed for so long without luring out the Old Stone Monster, Du Tiechuan chose to give up and truly began to treat his injuries.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
