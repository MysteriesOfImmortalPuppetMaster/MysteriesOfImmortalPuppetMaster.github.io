<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Thousand Peak Forest.<br/>
<br/>
The Frontline camp of the allied forces.<br/>
<br/>
“Stop!” Chen Lingfeng grabbed the two cultivators who were trying to sneak away and demanded in a harsh tone, “Are you trying to go pick up and salvage the spoils from the battlefield?”<br/>
<br/>
The two who were caught were flustered for a moment, then their expressions hardened immediately.<br/>
<br/>
One of them directly denied, “Of course not! We are going to scout the battlefield, waiting for an opportunity to inflict casualties on the other troops from the Twin Rivers Nation that rushed here.”<br/>
<br/>
The other one gritted his teeth and said, “Chen Lingfeng, you have no evidence; do not go spouting lies!”<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng sneered coldly, and was about to speak.<br/>
<br/>
A cultivator’s figure, like washed ink soaked into rice paper, quickly solidified, reverting into a dashing Nascent Soul cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this Nascent Soul cultivator, the two cultivators blocked by Chen Lingfeng could not help but show signs of nervousness.<br/>
<br/>
“Army Strategist Lu.” One of them saluted.<br/>
<br/>
The other one said through gritted teeth, “Great Cave Master Lu, the two of us were just about to proactively launch an attack, but Chen Lingfeng blocked us and wouldn’t let us go. Is your appearance this time also meant to stop us from fighting?”<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng, seeing that the two were turning the accusation against him, immediately became furious, “Bastards….”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu reached out to stop him, and instead smiled as he looked toward the two leaving the camp: “You two go ahead and act as you see fit.”<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng glared, “Army Master Lu, how can this be allowed? These are already the seventh group of people leaving. If you do not stop them, then there will be no one in the main camp who can take control of the situation.”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu smiled slightly and slowly shook his head, “I was appointed as a strategist because Lord Long values my counsel, only to provide suggestions; never to impose orders on others.”<br/>
<br/>
“All of you are members of the Thousand Peak Forest; you are either distant friends or close neighbors. Since Lord Long has not issued any orders to restrict everyone, why make things difficult now?”<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing this, the two cultivators heaved a sigh of relief, lavishly praised Lu Hongtu, and then declared that they absolutely intended to go into battle.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu, not wanting to listen to their lies, waved his hand at them.<br/>
<br/>
The two immediately left the camp.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng watched the figures of the two leaving, his eagle eyes as cold as ice, “I bet these two are definitely going to the battlefield to pick up the spoils of war.”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu smiled without speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng, agitated, said, “If Lord Long returns and sees that the various strong individuals in our camp have fled, how are we going to account for it?”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu laughed heartily, “Calm down, calm down!”<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng shook his head repeatedly, unwilling to speak more with Lu Hongtu, and turned away.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu, his gaze somber, slowly paced, left the camp, and walked up a nearby hill.<br/>
<br/>
The distant mountains lay quietly, the mountain ridges winding and undulating, layers upon layers of green being bathed in a soft radiance by the sunlight.<br/>
<br/>
The mountain wind gently brushed by, leaves rustled, and occasionally a few mountain sparrows flitted among the trees, breaking the brief silence.<br/>
<br/>
He took a deep breath; the air in the mountains was fresh, yet carried a trace of inexplicable oppression.<br/>
<br/>
In Lu Hongtu’s mind, the great battle from six days ago surfaced.<br/>
<br/>
The scenes of the fierce fight between the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and Du Tiechuan were deeply imprinted in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu, his eyes still somber, said, “The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King suffered a minor defeat; although it did not cause the alliance to crumble, it did scatter people’s hearts, and now some have begun to seek their own fortunes.”<br/>
<br/>
Many cultivators had risked entering the battlefield to pick up the spoils of war; it was a sign of everyone seeking their own fortune.<br/>
<br/>
“When the wind is in your favor it’s fine, but once it turns, the lack of unity within the alliance and everyone’s selfish desires will become apparent.”<br/>
<br/>
Just then, a figure appeared silently.<br/>
<br/>
The unfamiliar cultivator who appeared saluted Lu Hongtu, and then secretly reported the intelligence he had gathered.<br/>
<br/>
After listening, Lu Hongtu couldn’t help but furrow his brows slightly, “Have you not yet obtained any information about the Old Stone Monster?”<br/>
<br/>
The reporting cultivator showed an expression of shame, and stated that his group of several dozen had been making every effort to search and probe, but the Old Stone Monster had vanished as if it had suddenly evaporated, and no matter how they searched, they could not find him.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu nodded slightly and waved off the reporting cultivator, “Go down and continue probing.”<br/>
<br/>
Left alone again, he stood on the hilltop.<br/>
<br/>
A gust of cool mountain wind brushed over his tense face.<br/>
<br/>
His gaze fixed on a patch of clouds above the distant mountains, and he fell into deep thought.<br/>
<br/>
“The Old Stone Monster’s unpredictable movements are the most troublesome thing of all.”<br/>
<br/>
“He is at the Soul Formation Stage! He is the biggest variable that can affect this battle.”<br/>
<br/>
“Next, will he appear on the battlefield?”<br/>
<br/>
“According to his recent performance, a considerable amount of Soul Formation level treasure materials have been left behind on the battlefield. This must be a huge temptation for the Old Stone Monster.”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu returned to the main camp, and saw the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth boasting.<br/>
<br/>
“We infiltrated the battlefield and picked up several strands of Ginseng Dragon Whiserks.”<br/>
<br/>
“Look, this type of Ginseng dragon blood is extremely rare; every drop is the finest raw material for making healing pills!”<br/>
<br/>
The white-robed ghost cultivator Tian Shuang and the black-robed ghost cultivator Di Hui, in front of the strong cultivators, flaunted their harvest.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu, seeing this scene, immediately stepped into the meeting tent of the camp.<br/>
<br/>
He smiled slightly, “Fellow Daoists of the Soul Devouring Sect, you two, having come here deliberately to proclaim this, what is your purpose? Please speak it out. Perhaps we can cooperate.”<br/>
<br/>
The other cultivators, upon seeing that it was Lu Hongtu, all smiled or nodded in greeting.<br/>
<br/>
In the early days of the allied forces’ formation, it was Lu Hongtu who recruited people everywhere. During the clashes, Lu Hongtu repeatedly came up with tactics and indeed achieved results. Just now, Lu Hongtu did not follow Chen Lingfeng’s suggestion, and instead let go of the two cultivators who had slipped away to the battlefield to loot spoils, thereby winning everyone’s favor.<br/>
<br/>
The Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth, upon seeing Lu Hongtu, also nodded slightly. The two also had a good impression of Lu Hongtu.<br/>
<br/>
The two ghost cultivators exchanged a glance. Di Hui, being rather impatient by nature, said, “Fellow Lu, you speak directly; then the two of us will not hold anything back and will just say it straight.”<br/>
<br/>
Di Hui described the specific situation, which immediately triggered an uproar.<br/>
<br/>
“I didn’t hear it wrong, did I? Is it really True Glazed Heartblood?!”<br/>
<br/>
“This is the vital blood of earth-element demon cultivators. Left behind by the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, it must certainly be of the Soul Formation level.”<br/>
<br/>
“Not only that True Glazed Heartblood, but also Ginseng Root wall earth. This soil is extremely fertile, full of vitality, and is an excellent base for spiritual plants.”<br/>
<br/>
“But what exactly is that huge dragon-shaped talisman that the white-robed ghost spoke of?”<br/>
<br/>
An experienced elder explained, “It should be the dragon vein inscription.”<br/>
<br/>
“The enemy this time employed the Iron Flow Leveling the Plains military strategy, with huge energy consumption; Du Tiechuan did not hesitate to mobilize the dragon veins of the Twin Rivers Nation to infuse energy into the parade platform.”<br/>
<br/>
“Therefore, the Iron Flow Leveling the Plains naturally carries the great power of the dragon veins.”<br/>
<br/>
“Du Tiechuan and his heavy-armored main force, pushing in a sweeping manner and rolling in, meant that the dragon veins were simultaneously advancing in a massive surge.”<br/>
<br/>
“Especially in the places where he clashed with the Dragon King, the power of the dragon veins continuously erupted, eroding the surrounding environment, leaving behind dragon vein inscriptions.”<br/>
<br/>
“Of course, what is left on the battlefield is only a part of the inscriptions, just individual dragon-shaped runes.”<br/>
<br/>
“Along the path of the main force’s rampage, there must also be individual dragon-shaped runes hidden.”<br/>
<br/>
“We must find these runes and strip them away from the earth veins of the Thousand Peak Forest!”<br/>
<br/>
Although the Thousand Peak Forest is the territory of the Twin Rivers Nation, the Twin Rivers Nation has always lacked control over it, because the mountains, rivers, and so on here have all been occupied by various indigenous deities and have not been integrated into the national dragon veins.<br/>
<br/>
The dragon vein runes combine to form dragon vein inscriptions; once these inscriptions mark and permeate the mountains and rivers of the Thousand Peaks Forest, they will diminish the authority and power of the local deities, eventually absorbing the entire Thousand Peak Forest into themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The assembled cultivators, with solemn expressions, upon hearing the explanation, all declared that they wished to contribute to the Thousand Peaks Forest, and went off to search for the dragon vein runes.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone’s enthusiasm was completely mobilized, because the dragon vein runes were also a rare treasure, of high value and with unique uses.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, a large wave of cultivators left the tent, all rushing out of the camp.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng was so angry that his face turned pale.<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu watched the backs of the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth as they immediately left, his gaze somber.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Lingfeng sent his divine sense to communicate, “Lu Hongtu, it’s over now, there are less than ten people remaining. If Lord Long returns, you answer his questioning!”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu smiled, lightly clapped his hands, “Everyone, next, let us discuss the plan to attack the following troops of the Twin Rivers Nation.”<br/>
<br/>
“At present, the Twin Rivers Nation’ main heavy-armored armies are all busy stripping off their iron skin and meat armor, and are in a stage of recuperation.”<br/>
<br/>
“The following troops of the Twin Rivers Nation consist of those who did not meet the selection criteria and were brushed aside. We need to completely annihilate this force!”<br/>
<br/>
“If we allow them to merge together, it would be a dereliction of our duty.”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu’s proposal was completely approved by the cultivators who remained.<br/>
<br/>
These people were almost all barbarian cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the evil demonic deviants and the freewheeling demon cultivators who ran into the Thousand Peak Forest from outside to hide, the indigenous core of the Thousand Peak Forest were barbarian cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
The deities worshipped by the barbarians were also the stubborn defenders who monopolized the mountains and waters of the Thousand Peak Forest.<br/>
<br/>
These people were the most loyal and reliable backbone forces.<br/>
<br/>
“However, even if we manage to completely wipe out the subsequent troops, it would be nothing more than mere drumming on the side.”<br/>
<br/>
“The true key to this great battle remains the contest of the Soul Formation Powerhouses.”<br/>
<br/>
“Old Stone Monster, it’s now up to your actions!”<br/>
<br/>
Lu Hongtu had a clear and deep understanding of the situation.<br/>
<br/>
At the edge of the grand battle’s battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical dragon shrank to a small size, hiding in a dense canopy of trees.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, excitedly, took out the corpse of the Old Stone Monster, “Next, it’s time for us to act.”<br/>
<br/>
However, in the very next moment, Ning Zhuo’s finger felt pain.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanical finger ring!<br/>
<br/>
“Huh?!” Ning Zhuo was instantly startled.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical finger ring contracted with an unprecedented force, nearly making him feel as if it would break his finger bones.<br/>
<br/>
“Wait a moment!” Ning Zhuo immediately called out, stopping Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong looked at him in confusion, and then saw Ning Zhuo raise his palm.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical finger ring contracted fiercely, compressing Ning Zhuo’s finger into a deformed shape.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo, not only bound by a life-and-death friendship but also well acquainted with the ins and outs of the mechanical finger ring, immediately had their pupils contract as they speculated, “The mechanical finger ring is giving a warning? Is it telling us that if we continue this action, we will suffer a serious misfortune?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked at the mechanical finger ring, “I think it would be more prudent not to deploy it again as the Old Stone Monster.”<br/>
<br/>
As if sensing the change in Ning Zhuo’s intent, the mechanical finger ring immediately returned to its original state.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s face turned solemn, no longer in a frivolous mood.<br/>
<br/>
With his quick mind, he immediately realized the key, “Oh, I understand now.”<br/>
<br/>
“Our previous events on Bikong Mountain have probably been leaked.”<br/>
<br/>
“That Void Evil God Bone is an even more obscure existence; being able to be stored there for many years without anyone knowing about this secret, thus the Old Stone Monster will be estimated as a Soul Formation level being.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, and then continued, “Originally, the campaign in the Thousand Peak Forest was merely a contest between the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and Du Tiechuan.”<br/>
<br/>
“Although there was the Soul Formation level national beast, the two-headed badger, the previous battle had already shown that it was not key.”<br/>
<br/>
“Therefore, the Soul Formation level demon cultivator Old Stone Monster, who had always remained on the sidelines, has become an existence that both sides, friend and foe, are wary of!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sighed, “The Old Stone Monster and the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King have similar origins, and the former also has the widely circulated history of devouring fragments of the treasure rock.”<br/>
<br/>
“Once we take on that role and run into the battlefield, it might end up that Du Tiechuan and the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King will successively target us!”<br/>
<br/>
At this point in their exchange, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo both broke out in cold sweat.<br/>
<br/>
“In that case, although the previous battle between Du Tiechuan and the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King was fierce and every move was bloody, they still held back to some extent.”<br/>
<br/>
“After all, they have also been guarding against the Old Stone Monster.” “Could it be that the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King’s retreat was partly for show?”<br/>
<br/>
“And then there’s Du Tiechuan, who after the battle built a massive military camp, then announced a period of seclusion for recuperation, only occasionally issuing military orders. He, too, is waiting for the rabbit by the tree, right?”<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong looked at each other, and for a moment, were speechless.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, Ning Zhuo obediently returned to Liu Er and Zhang Hei’s side, and together with them, harvested the Ginseng Dragon Whiserks.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, three days passed.<br/>
<br/>
“Dragon blood, such a huge pool of Ginseng dragon blood.” Under a pile of broken stones, Luo Xiwei, using the earth tunneling technique, crept in, his expression extremely excited.<br/>
<br/>
He was a demon cultivator, wielding a five-section staff, and was proficient in earth-based magic.<br/>
<br/>
Even before the Two Ghosts of Heaven and Earth publicized that there were great treasures hidden on the battlefield, he had already sneakily infiltrated the battlefield to reap benefits.<br/>
<br/>
The earth-yellow Ginseng dragon blood seeped deep underground, contaminating a stone, causing its surface to emit a soft, precious glow, and even the hard stone became pliable, even possessing some elasticity.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Xiwei terminated his earth tunneling technique, and just as he was about to reach out his hand to take it,<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a ray of icy light pierced through the layers of broken stones, with speed like lightning, and struck him!<br/>
<br/>
Luo Xiwei had no time to react at all, and was frozen in place.<br/>
<br/>
He widened his eyes, a look of terror frozen on his face, completely immobilized by the thick layer of ice.<br/>
<br/>
Northern Abyss Rapid Freezing Light!<br/>
<br/>
At the edge of the military camp, the cold light of a watchtower slowly extinguished. Just now, from its top a beam of white light had been emitted, freezing to death the Golden Core cultivator Luo Xiwei.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, the cultivators both inside and outside the camp were shaken, all casting probing glances.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, a thread of flame made a circle in mid-air, agilely darting into the pile of broken stones.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, a piercing, miserable wail was heard from a cultivator who was burned to death.<br/>
<br/>
Death-Parting Fire!<br/>
<br/>
This was a fierce attack launched from another watchtower.<br/>
<br/>
After the cultivators recovered their senses, there was an uproar.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators of the Thousand Peak Forest, frightened, fled wildly by various means.<br/>
<br/>
One beam of white light after another shot out!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, strands of flame circled through the air, seeking out and pursuing enemies.<br/>
<br/>
Many cultivators of the Thousand Peak Forest, due to their own greed, paid the price with their lives.<br/>
<br/>
That night.<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan, who received the military report, had a worried expression.<br/>
<br/>
He did not regard these battle results as significant.<br/>
<br/>
“The real key is still the Old Stone Monster.”<br/>
<br/>
“Since it did not appear, then that’s all there is to it.”<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan coughed twice, each time spitting out earthen yellow blood.<br/>
<br/>
He waved his sleeve and completely closed the door of the secret chamber.<br/>
<br/>
Having delayed for so long without luring out the Old Stone Monster, Du Tiechuan chose to give up and truly began to treat his injuries.</div>
