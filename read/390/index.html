<paragraph index="1">At the Mountain Gate Master's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Xiao Ju handed Lin Shanshan some intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">After reading the jade slip with her spiritual sense, Lin Shanshan said disappointedly, "Ning Zhuo is still in seclusion and hasn't come out yet?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Big Senior Brother is really something, being a drunkard himself, and getting someone drunk on their first meeting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"I wonder if Young Master Ning Zhuo drank too much at once and is still in seclusion, sleeping off the alcohol? Spiritual wine is different from ordinary wine. Even a cultivator who drinks too much spiritual wine might not be able to sober up for months, or even years in some cases."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Xiao Ju said, "Young Miss, you weren't there at the time, you didn't see the scene with your own eyes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"I actually think Young Master Ning Zhuo likes to drink himself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Lin Shanshan suddenly became a bit anxious, twirling her hair and thinking, "Oh my, why did I get confined? I wonder what Young Master Ning Zhuo looks like when he's drunk."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Speaking of which, I should criticize you. Why didn't you record the scene that day with a jade slip?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Xiao Ju said apologetically, "Young Miss, please don't criticize me for this. I already know I was wrong!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"You've criticized me no less than a hundred times these past few days."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Not to mention that privately recording someone's situation is a very offensive thing to do. I'm just a servant, a maid, how could I capture images of Big Senior Brother?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Even if I had such thoughts that day, wouldn't Big Senior Brother or Young Master Ning Zhuo have seen through it immediately?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"At that time, if I were driven out, wouldn't Big Senior Brother and Young Master Ning Zhuo be left without anyone to take care of them?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"That's more like it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">As the two were talking, a servant came with a message.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">It was a letter from Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Xiao Ju reacted a beat late, feeling puzzled: "Why would the Ning family's Golden Core Ancestor send a letter to you, Young Miss?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Lin Shanshan's eyes brightened: "Xiao Ju, didn't you hear Young Master Ning Zhuo say last time that he and Ning Jiufan are close? This must be a letter from Young Master Ning Zhuo, just sent through Ning Jiufan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"I've been confined and watched over by many senior brothers, who won't let me contact Young Master Ning Zhuo or receive his letters. But they wouldn't dare intercept a letter from Ancestor Ning Jiufan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Haha, it's all thanks to Young Master Ning Zhuo for coming up with this clever method!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Lin Shanshan took the letter and opened it. Her expression changed from joy to worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Ah, Young Master Ning Zhuo's spirit plant has a problem. If it can't be saved, it will surely die."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"What should we do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Xiao Ju also became worried.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Although she had only met Ning Zhuo twice, she had taken a liking to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Xiao Ju was more worried about Lin Shanshan: "Young Miss, you're confined now, how can you help Young Master Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Lin Shanshan looked at the letter: "Young Master Ning Zhuo also said in the letter that he wants to seek help from Big Senior Brother. With Big Senior Brother's help, it would be much more useful than mine."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Xiao Ju finally felt relieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Almost at the same time, Ning Zhuo arrived at the Ten Thousand Demons Cave again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Elder Brother Linghu!" He brought cloud tea and was warmly welcomed by Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Haha, Brother Ning Zhuo, please come in quickly." Linghu Jiu stepped out of the cave entrance, took Ning Zhuo's arm, and led him inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo offered the special cloud tea, saying this tea could help one understand the principles of the clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Linghu Jiu accepted it directly: "Good tea, good tea. Even if I don't drink it, I'll distribute it to my junior brothers and sisters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo said, "Elder Brother Linghu, don't worry. Since our last drink together, I and your sect's senior and junior brothers like Lao De have resolved all our grievances."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Linghu Jiu laughed heartily and led Ning Zhuo to a seat: "Speaking of which, these past few days drinking alone has been quite tasteless. Now that Brother Ning Zhuo is here, let's drink until we're drunk!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo was initially delighted, but then smiled bitterly and explained his predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Linghu Jiu didn't hesitate. He took out his identity token and gave it to Ning Zhuo: "Use as much of the sect's resources as you need!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"If it's not enough, just tell me. I have enough influence among my junior brothers and sisters to gather more resources."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo just cupped his hands and casually thanked him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This attitude pleased Linghu Jiu greatly: "Excellent, Brother Ning Zhuo should be this casual. We're drinking buddies, we're our own people!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"But, with your spirit plant in such a critical condition, can you treat it by yourself?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"There are many cultivators in our sect who are proficient with spirit plants, and my master is the best among them. If possible, I advise you to seek help from experts for treatment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"When a spirit plant is critically ill, many daily cultivation and nurturing methods have little effect, and may even have the opposite effect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo nodded, keeping this advice in mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Before leaving, he told Linghu Jiu about receiving further teachings from the Five Elements Divine Lord after returning to his cave dwelling on Little Contention Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"At that time, I hadn't drunk any more of the Meditative Brew, so how did I receive another transmission from the Divine Lord?" Ning Zhuo expressed his confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Linghu Jiu was also quite puzzled: "This situation is indeed strange, I haven't encountered it before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Perhaps you still had some lingering alcohol in your body, allowing you to communicate with the ancestors in the netherworld?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"After all... no one has ever drunk so much Meditative Brew at once before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly and waved his hand: "I'm embarrassed, Elder Brother Linghu. Drinking so fiercely was indeed my first time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">"May I be so bold as to ask, Elder Brother, can the recipe for the Meditative Brew be sold to me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Linghu Jiu frowned: "If it were mine, why would I need to sell it? I'd just give it to you, brother. The problem is, this wine recipe was specially sought out by my master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"For this, master paid a huge sum to that Black and White Wine Immortal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"If you're interested in the recipe, you can use the Ning family's Golden Core Ancestor to include this transaction as part of the cooperation between our two parties."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo nodded and sighed: "I'm afraid Sect Leader Lin Bufan won't allow it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Linghu Jiu snorted: "I actually think this is feasible. After all, in this sect, the Meditative Brew is only suitable for my use. Others have tried it, but with little gain, practically useless to them."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"You, brother, are special, so the value of this wine is truly great for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"Hey, you can get wine from me, you know."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Master gives me a few jars of Meditative Brew regularly. Don't leave yet, I'll give you half a jar right now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Linghu Jiu only had one jar of Meditative Brew left, but he still gave half of it to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo was quite moved. He thanked him again and bid a reluctant farewell to Linghu Jiu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">With Linghu Jiu's token, he could move freely on the original mountain. He first went to the library, read many books, but couldn't find a definite solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Although he collected many rescue methods for spirit plants, he didn't dare to use them recklessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Some books and secret classics indeed recorded cultivation and treatment methods for the Spirit Concealing Willow. But the situations in the books differed from what Ning Zhuo was facing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Unable to prescribe the right treatment himself, Ning Zhuo had to consult several well-known and friendly spirit plant users in the Myriad Medicine Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">These spirit plant masters heard Ning Zhuo's questions and all shook their heads, saying they needed to determine exactly what the spirit plant was before they could prescribe the right treatment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, then concealed some information and directly set up a case study, including the Spirit Concealing Willow in it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">As a result, the spirit plant masters all said that even for the same disease, the treatment methods differ depending on the severity and urgency, requiring specific judgment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">After hitting a dead end, Ning Zhuo went to find Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Ancestor, come quick, I'll show you something good!" Ning Zhuo called out to Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Jiufan became wary: "You little rascal, what mischief are you up to now? What kind of trap are you setting?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"This is a treasure. You'll regret it for life if you don't see it." As he spoke, Ning Zhuo untied the mechanical dragon from his waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon? No wonder this little guy could run away so quickly!" Ning Jiufan's eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Ning Zhuo said nonchalantly: "The mere Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon is nothing compared to the great treasure I'm about to show you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">This further piqued Ning Jiufan's curiosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Immediately, Ning Zhuo led Ning Jiufan into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">A while later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Inside the spirit plant cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"This, this, this! If my old eyes aren't deceiving me, this should be the Spirit Concealing Willow!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"A Spirit Concealing Willow with Golden Core aura, incredible, incredible! Even I can be uplifted by it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"But... why is its vitality and aura so weak?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo pointed at the Spirit Concealing Willow: "Ancestor, your perspective is too narrow."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"How can you only think of yourself?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"This is a legacy treasure! When we take it back to the family in the future, the whole clan will benefit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Our Ning family will grow and prosper!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Jiufan laughed angrily: "You're not wrong, my perspective isn't as broad as yours. So, you little rascal, do you want to release it for the whole clan to use? Including the main branch?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo smiled: "That's not impossible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Jiufan was suddenly curious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo added: "As long as Ancestor helps to save this Spirit Concealing Willow!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Jiufan was shocked: "What? It's dying?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo spread his hands: "This current state and aura is barely maintained by my utmost efforts and enormous expenditure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Ancestor, whether our Ning family can have another legacy treasure depends on you now!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Ning Jiufan rubbed his forehead, feeling immense pressure, and couldn't help but laugh and curse: "You little brat, so this is where you were waiting for your old ancestor!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
