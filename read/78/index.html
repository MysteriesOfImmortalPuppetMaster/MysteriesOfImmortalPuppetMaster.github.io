<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Han Ming seemed to have thought of something. She looked at Ning Zhuo, eyes sparkling with curiosity and inquiry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">She swallowed cautiously and asked, “May I ask, Sir, if you were the one who killed this old ape?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Behind the mask, Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes slightly. “Yes, it was me. So what?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Han Ming immediately gasped, adjusting her posture so that she was kneeling on both knees and bowing deeply to Ning Zhuo. “Sir, this humble woman is willing to become your maidservant. Please allow me to sign a soul contract and serve you for life!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but frown, finding Han Ming's behavior quite strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">At first, when Ning Zhuo had captured Han Ming alive and used her for her soul essence, she had been full of hatred and resentment toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Later, her attitude softened, but that was only because her fear of death forced her to submit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">But now, Ning Zhuo could feel genuine sincerity and heartfelt admiration from her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Of course, Ning Zhuo could be mistaken. But Han Ming’s attitude indeed gave him the sense that something had fundamentally changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Why?” Ning Zhuo looked down at Han Ming and asked calmly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Han Ming took a deep breath and straightened her upper body while remaining kneeling. She looked up at Ning Zhuo. “Sir, do you know about fate energy?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Ning Zhuo frowned and thought for a moment before answering, “I do know a bit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">“Fate energy is also called ‘numbered breaths’[^1]. From the moment we are born, we start breathing. When our lives end, our breathing stops. The number of breaths we take is our fate energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“This is why many cultivators advocate non-contention and seek to maintain inner peace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">“Injuries from battle can severely decrease your fate energy. Emotions like anger, fear, despair, or even extreme joy can also cause rapid breathing and reduce fate energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Thus, many cultivators strive to avoid conflict with others. By remaining calm and peaceful, they often live longer lives.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Han Ming nodded. “This interpretation of fate energy is indeed the most widespread among the cultivation world. But although it’s part of the truth, it doesn’t reveal the full picture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Back in the sect, I was fortunate enough to come across a book called ‘Theory of Numbered Breaths, Volume One’, a secret text from the Heavenly Path Mansion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo slightly raised an eyebrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He had heard of the Heavenly Path Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It was an extremely mysterious super sect with few successors. But every time a successor appeared, they would bring about massive changes in the world of cultivation. This was because each generation would choose a destined child of heaven and guide the great trend, leading to the destruction of old kingdoms and the rise of new ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly. “To possess books of such caliber, the Soul Devouring Sect that Han Ming belongs to really deserves to be called a major sect of the demonic path.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">As for himself, over the past ten-plus years, he had at most browsed the Ning Clan’s library. And even that was only the portion open to the public, not the secret vault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“Go on,” said Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Han Ming swallowed again and remained kneeling. “The Theory of Numbered Breaths says that everyone’s fate energy is different. Some have more, some less, some stronger, some weaker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Those with better spirit roots and innate talents tend to have greater and stronger fate energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Among them, super-grade innate talents, also known as immortal talents, possess the greatest quantity and quality of fate energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Those with immortal talent often encounter many benefactors and have opportunities fall into their laps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“They rarely fall into true despair, and usually always have a sliver of hope. As long as they grasp it, they can survive, turn the tide, and even transform misfortune into blessing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“When someone with ordinary fate energy tries to deal with such a person, they will face all sorts of accidents, whether from their own mistakes or external interference, and ultimately end in failure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Hearing this, Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred slightly, beginning to understand the reason behind Han Ming’s change in attitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Interesting. Keep going.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">“Yes.” Han Ming continued, “I remember the ‘Theory of Numbered Breaths’ listed many real-life examples.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">“Many holders of immortal talent were suppressed in various ways. As long as they endured and adapted, they would achieve rapid improvement in some area due to the pressure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">“And those who tried to eliminate the immortal talent holders usually met miserable ends.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“During the process of confronting an immortal talent holder, their own fate energy would be drained, affecting their judgment and mental state and leading to confusion and poor decisions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“In the end, they would bring suffering or even death upon themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“Killing an immortal talent holder isn’t something ordinary people can do so easily!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">At this point, Han Ming looked at Hanging-Hair Traveler Ning Zhuo with obvious fervor in her eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“I understand what you mean.” Ning Zhuo was as humble as ever as he spoke. “However, although I was the one to get rid of Yuan Dasheng, I did employ external help. Perhaps it was the combined fate energy of myself and others that suppressed Yuan Dasheng’s.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Han Ming immediately shook her head. “Sir, according to the explanation in the Theory of Numbered Breaths, cooperation does not result in simple addition of fate energy. Sometimes it even causes internal depletion and subtraction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“The Theory of Numbered Breaths gives the example of Nie Xiongfeng[^2] and Chu Liuyun[^3]. Sir, you should know about them, right? Both were holders of immortal talents as well as mutual enemies. At first, Nie Xiongfeng looked down on Chu Liuyun and sent subordinates after him again and again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Chu Liuyun grew stronger through each pursuit, eventually turning the tables and killing Nie Xiongfeng.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This legendary conflict was a famous story in the world of cultivation. The battle between the two led to the fall of one super sect and the rise of another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Han Ming sighed. “Immortal talent holders are one in a million among cultivators. That’s based on cultivator numbers, not ordinary mortals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“Each immortal talent holder’s fate energy is incredibly strong and naturally attracts destined opportunities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“When it comes to fate energy, even two holders of high-grade innate talents combined can’t match up to a single super-grade innate talent holder.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“I see.” Ning Zhuo let out a cold snort. “So you’ve seen through it. Indeed, I have a super-grade innate talent!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Han Ming was stunned, then overjoyed. She bowed again. “Sir, this humble woman is willing to be your maidservant and devote herself entirely to serving you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">She had already submitted earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Now, after deducing that Ning Zhuo possessed an immortal talent, even her pride as a member of a major demonic sect had completely vanished.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">It had to be known that even within a major sect of the demonic path, the number of individuals with immortal talents rarely exceeded ten.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Following someone like that meant a bright and beautiful future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Of course, Han Ming’s actions were also driven by fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">During this period of time, she had devoured far too many monkey souls. She absolutely did not want to turn into a monkey woman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">He himself wasn’t certain what grade his hidden innate talent was, but in this moment, regardless of the truth, accepting Han Ming was the best choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“This old man will reluctantly take you in,” said Hanging-Hair Traveler Ning Zhuo, his voice still hoarse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Thank you for your grace, Sir!” Han Ming said excitedly, bowing her head to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">When she lifted her head, she added, “Also, congratulations to Sir for eliminating an immortal talent. Your own fate energy has now greatly increased!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Oh? What’s the reasoning behind that?” Ning Zhuo asked with curiosity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">[^1]: Chinese has about a billion different terms for fate. The one here is 气数, which literally means “qi number”. Qi can mean “breath”, so here it is “number of breaths”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">[^2]: Nie Xiongfeng – 聂雄风 – Nie is a surname and can mean “whisper”. Xiongfeng means “strong wind” but is also an idiom that refers to a majestic demeanor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">[^3]: Chu Liuyun – 楚流云 – Chu is a surname. Liuyun means “flowing cloud”.</paragraph><br/><br/>
