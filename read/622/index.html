<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Within the colossal well, the Yin Tide surged like a raging river, its waves crashing against the well walls with thunderous booms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The towering White Paper City Lord locked eyes with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Her Paper Doll Clone was about to speak when the City Lord's True Form preemptively commanded, "Don't stop."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Yang Sanyan and Wen Ruanyu exchanged bewildered glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The order was clearly directed at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Just because you tell me to keep going, I should?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo promptly ceased his actions, stepped back, and clasped his hands in a respectful bow. "This junior, Ning Zhuo, son of Meng Yaoyin, pays his respects to the White Paper City Lord!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The City Lord's gaze remained fixed on Ning Zhuo, but a flicker of intrigue crossed her expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo's response was intriguing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">If one were to praise his courtesy, he had directly defied the City Lord's command to continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Yet if one were to accuse him of disrespect, he had performed a flawless bow, leaving no room for reproach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The Paper Doll Clone flew to its True Form's side. "True Form, much has transpired during your unconsciousness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The City Lord finally shifted her gaze and nodded slightly at her clone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">In the next instant, she lowered her defenses, allowing the clone to approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The clone grasped the True Form's hand, and within a dozen breaths, they exchanged information through their divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The City Lord's True Form revealed a sudden realization as she gazed at Ning Zhuo. "Meng Yaoyin... I never imagined you were the son of an old friend."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"Now that I look closely, you do share a resemblance with your mother in your eyes and brows."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Your temperament is similar too. Both of you are remarkably opinionated, even to the point of stubbornness."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Back then, I urged your mother not to sacrifice her lifespan to save others. She completely disregarded my advice and insisted on acting."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo's ears twitched slightly. "I never expected to find traces of my mother's life in the White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"I understand my mother well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"She was kind-hearted and compassionate, and she would have willingly dedicated herself to White Paper Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Zhuo's tone shifted. "However, she passed away when I was only two years old."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"So, my views and hers might differ."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"I can continue supplying you with Yang Qi, City Lord. What can you offer in exchange?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The White Paper City Lord was a Nascent Soul cultivator, while Ning Zhuo was merely at the Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Yet the young man possessed such audacity that he could converse calmly with a Nascent Soul expert, even directly negotiate and bargain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">After all, he had slain Nascent Soul cultivators during the great war in Two Note Kingdom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The City Lord's True Form fell silent, while her clone spoke, "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, you are already the Vice City Lord of this city. Second only to the City Lord herself, above all others..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo waved his hand dismissively. "It's merely a nominal position. I plan to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect in the future and won't remain here long. Therefore, the Vice City Lord title holds little appeal for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Wen Ruanyu opened his mouth to speak, but his lips moved silently, and he remained silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The City Lord's True Form chuckled softly. "You're not one to speak idly. Since you propose an exchange, you must desire something specific. Why not state your request directly? Let's see if I can grant it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"It's simple," Ning Zhuo said calmly. "I want the Paper Giant at the city's south gate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The City Lord's True Form fell silent again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The clone spoke with a troubled expression. "This Paper Giant was indeed created because of Meng Yaoyin. However, it's a Nascent Soul-level trump card. From its initial construction to its current maintenance, White Paper Immortal City has invested immense resources. With the Immortal City now besieged on all sides, we desperately need such defenses. We cannot rashly sell it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Zhuo replied, "If the City Lord grants my request, I assure you I won't take the Paper Giant before this crisis is resolved."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"We must wait until the Immortal City has weathered the Ghost Tide and repelled the Underworld army's assault, until the situation stabilizes, before taking the Paper Giant," Ning Zhuo insisted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Paper Doll Clone hesitated. "Actually, the initial idea for the Paper Giant came from Wen Ruanyu. He was one of the founders, and we must consider his feelings in this matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo turned to Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Wen Ruanyu smiled without hesitation, meeting Ning Zhuo's gaze. "I only just learned that Ning Zhuo is Senior Sister's biological son. Though this hasn't been formally confirmed to me, deep down, I prefer to believe this romantic notion."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"I have no objection to entrusting the Paper Giant to Ning Zhuo!" Wen Ruanyu's answer was direct and unequivocal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo immediately returned a grateful smile.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Yang Sanyan nodded slightly at Wen Ruanyu, clearly pleased with his stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Wen Ruanyu's position was complex. On one hand, he was a Golden Core True Inheritor of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, managing the sect's local outpost. On the other hand, he was a high-ranking official in White Paper Immortal City, having devoted years to its administration and development.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Wen Ruanyu's agreement to Ning Zhuo's request was a clear declaration of his allegiance. It was evident that his loyalty lay with the Myriad Manifestations Sect rather than White Paper Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Seeing his stance, the White Paper City Lord finally spoke: "Very well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The White Paper City Lord was equally decisive, immediately agreeing to Ning Zhuo's request: "After the battle, the Paper Giant will be yours."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Moreover..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The City Lord proactively offered the four Soul Cultivator treasures she had previously gifted to Ning Zhuo as additional rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Her reasoning was simple: Ning Zhuo had exposed Zheng Shoumo, the grand internal traitor, and deserved substantial recognition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Each of these four Soul Cultivator treasures was of the Nascent Soul level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The White Paper City Lord's True Form and Clones shared a consistent style - both were remarkably generous and magnanimous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Hahaha! This City Lord is truly astute and knows how to seize opportunities. Excellent, Little Zhuo!" Sun Lingtong, who had been observing everything from afar using his Life Thred Connection, was delighted and secretly congratulated Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo, however, remained calm, analyzing the situation inwardly: "As expected of the White Paper City Lord - her political acumen is formidable!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"She's already laying the groundwork for the future ecosystem of the Immortal City."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The current situation had Ning Zhuo, the savior, leaning toward the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The White Paper Immortal City desperately needed the sect's renewed assistance to weather this crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Before Ning Zhuo officially joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the City Lord was already heavily courting him with lavish rewards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">She likely planned for Ning Zhuo to serve as a bridge between the White Paper Immortal City and the Myriad Manifestations Sect as Vice City Lord in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">In other words, the White Paper City Lord was not only trying to win over Ning Zhuo, but also positioning him as a future mediator in the power struggles between the White Paper Immortal City and the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Enough of that. The future will take care of itself. What matters most is resolving the present," Ning Zhuo thought, recognizing the City Lord's strategic foresight. While wary, he couldn't help but admire her ambition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After all, she was genuinely magnanimous and truly investing heavily in securing his allegiance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo first thanked the City Lord for her generous reward, then steered the conversation back on track. "Now that you've awakened, City Lord, let's finalize the Divine Contract before discussing further matters."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Yang Sanyan observed Ning Zhuo, impressed by his steady temperament and meticulous approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The City Lord's True Form nodded slightly. "Agreed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yang Sanyan produced a Divine Edict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The scroll unfurled, revealing the image of the Celestial God Contract on its reverse side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The deity's face was as flawless as jade, with a third eye open on his forehead. In one hand, he held the Mirror of Past Causes, and in the other, the Golden Edict of Future Consequences. He wore a moon-white celestial silk robe embroidered with cloud patterns, a dark jade dragon pendant at his waist, and mountain-and-river boots. Beneath him rode a three-legged Azure Harmony Crane.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The crane's feathers shimmered with hidden truths of the Great Dao, and each flap of its wings scattered golden contract glyphs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">On the scroll's front lay the full text of the Divine Contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo and the others carefully studied the contents of the Celestial God Contract, each offering their opinions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Yang Sanyan immediately revised the document, and after confirming it was error-free, he promptly activated the Divine Edict.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Harnessing the power of the Celestial God Contract, they swore that none of them had any close ties to Zheng Shoumo or the mysterious organization. Violation of this oath would result in the Celestial God Contract's retribution, leading to their death and the dissolution of their cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">With the Divine Contract established, everyone present remained unharmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Yang Sanyan and the others breathed a collective sigh of relief, and the tension in the air dissipated significantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The City Lord Clone spoke, "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, would you please demonstrate your Dual Cultivation techniques once more?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo coughed awkwardly, quickly correcting her. "It was merely a minor exchange of yin and yang energies. I wouldn't consider it true Dual Cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"However, before we proceed, I have a small request."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Please, speak freely," the City Lord Clone replied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Earlier, you kindly bestowed three talisman papers upon me. I must ask you to take them back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">These three talisman papers had burrowed directly into Ning Zhuo's three dantian, where he had suppressed them using three different cultivation techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had already planned to use the Theft Path Methods to retrieve these talismans. After all, human hearts were unpredictable, and these were three hidden thunderbolts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">However, neither of them was certain whether their Theft Path Methods would succeed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Having the City Lord Clone personally retrieve them would be the best outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The City Lord Clone hesitated. "Is this wise? I'll imbue you with three talisman papers, each capable of saving you once. You're currently impersonating Jiao Ma, and the taller the tree, the stronger the wind. What if Zheng Shoumo isn't the only internal traitor targeting you?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo instinctively touched his Mechanism Ring and bluntly told the City Lord Clone to take the talismans. He had his own means of self-protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Seeing Ning Zhuo's firm stance, the City Lord Clone didn't press the matter. She summoned the three talisman papers with a wave of her hand and retrieved them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Only then did Ning Zhuo resume his efforts, releasing Yang Qi to supply the White Paper City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The White Paper City Lord's True Form slowly closed her eyes, falling into a moment of contemplative silence as if savoring the energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After a while, she opened her eyes again, her gaze questioning: "Why did you stop?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo forced a bitter smile, his voice weak and apologetic. "Senior, your power is as vast as the sea and as solid as a mountain. I'm merely a humble Foundation Establishment cultivator. Reaching this point has already pushed me to my limit. Continuing further might cost me my lifespan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"I'll need some time to recuperate before I can gather such Yang Qi again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Of course, this wasn't entirely true.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle still held thirty percent of its Yang Qi reserves. Ning Zhuo had only used seventy percent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The White Paper City Lord quietly observed Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo met the City Lord's gaze without fear, his expression open and honest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The City Lord's True Form spoke coldly, "I am unfamiliar with this medical technique. Little Friend Ning Zhuo, would you be willing to sell it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head in refusal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Noticing the tense atmosphere, Wen Ruanyu quickly congratulated the City Lord, attempting to ease the tension.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The City Lord's True Form nodded slightly. "In that case, I can finally leave the Deep Well temporarily. At least I'll have the strength to fight in times of crisis."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"But only temporarily."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"The truth is clear to all of you. Without my personal suppression, the White Paper Immortal City's foundations will inevitably crumble under this overwhelming Yin Qi. The city will fall, and its people will perish!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Wen Ruanyu hastily praised the City Lord's noble character, secretly acknowledging the immense sacrifices she had made for the sake of countless citizens.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"For specific defense arrangements, simply consult my clone," the City Lord's True Form said, dismissing them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Yang Sanyan had no choice but to take his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">After the Formation space closed, they retreated to a small reception hall. There, they summoned Tie Guzheng and secretly discussed matters for half an hour, reaching preliminary consensus on many points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">That evening, Ning Zhuo hosted a dinner for Yang Sanyan and Wen Ruanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">During the meal, Ning Zhuo showed Wen Ruanyu some items left behind by his mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">This tangible proof finally convinced Wen Ruanyu of Ning Zhuo's identity. His eyes reddened at the table, and tears began to fall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">He immediately pledged to Ning Zhuo, "Little Zhuo, if you ever face any difficulties in the future, come to me without hesitation! I will do everything in my power to assist you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Yang Sanyan turned to Wen Ruanyu and said, "Little Friend Ning Zhuo possesses extraordinary talent and remarkable skills. This year's Flying Cloud Assembly presents a golden opportunity for him to soar to new heights."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"In the future, you might face difficulties that require his intervention to resolve."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Though Yang Sanyan had only just met Ning Zhuo, their brief shared experience had completely changed his perception of the young man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Wen Ruanyu nodded in agreement with Yang Sanyan's words.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo waved his hand, offering modest self-deprecation while maintaining an air of confident composure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The next day, Qing Chi came to find Ning Zhuo early in the morning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"I heard you entered the City Lord's Mansion yesterday and were received by the City Lord's True Form. You even hosted a banquet for that guy Yang Sanyan last night. Did he give you any trouble?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Qing Chi, who had been captured by Yang Sanyan, harbored no fondness for the man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Ning Zhuo shook his head, assuring Qing Chi that he had resolved the matter and secured Yang Sanyan's support. He also mentioned his plans to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, urging her not to worry.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Tears welled up in Qing Chi's eyes. "Little Ma, I know how much you've sacrificed for me. To appease Yang Sanyan, you've sold yourself - sold yourself to the Myriad Manifestations Sect!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"That Yang Sanyan must have coveted your talent. Capturing me was just a way to force your hand..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">In Qing Chi's eyes, Jiao Ma was a priceless treasure, coveted by all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Just as the White Paper City Lord had done, Yang Sanyan also tried to persuade Ning Zhuo to join his faction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo was speechless. He could only offer a few comforting words to Qing Chi, assuring her that joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect would lead to a brighter future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Qing Chi immediately declared that she would also attend the Flying Cloud Assembly and cultivate alongside Jiao Ma.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo's scalp tingled. Naturally, he didn't want to spend every day with Qing Chi. He swiftly changed the subject. "By the way, Miss Qing Chi, have you gained any insights from your recent studies of military manuals?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Ning Zhuo asked casually, but Qing Chi tilted her head proudly and announced, "Oh, you noticed! I've grasped another military system."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Ning Zhuo eagerly pressed for details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Qing Chi touched her nose and explained, "I observed the exorbitant resources our army consumes. This inspired me to devise a system called 'A Decade's Preparation for a Single Campaign'..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">She elaborated on the system, leaving Ning Zhuo secretly impressed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">"Qing Chi's talent for military strategy is truly exceptional!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Comparing himself, Ning Zhuo realized he hadn't yet comprehended even a single military system, while Qing Chi had already mastered two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Following this good news came a grave report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Sun Lingtong, using the Life Hanging Thread to relay military intelligence, warned, "Little Zhuo, the situation is dire! The Underworld army is mobilizing on a massive scale. The final battle may be imminent."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
