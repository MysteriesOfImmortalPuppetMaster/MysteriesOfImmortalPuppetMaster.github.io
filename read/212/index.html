<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 212: Three Paths to Foundation Establishment</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Yuan Dasheng?!" Zhu Xuanji's pupils contracted slightly as he stood in place, stunned for a good while.<br/>
<br/>
"Could it really be Yuan Dasheng?"<br/>
<br/>
He had considered this possibility before, but as soon as the thought arose, he quickly dismissed it.<br/>
<br/>
In Zhu Xuanji's view, the Mechanical Demon General was undoubtedly at the Golden Core Stage!<br/>
<br/>
Within its body, the true scripture recorded on the Blood Path Diagram should at least be at the Golden Core level.<br/>
<br/>
If it wasn't, then the Blood Path Diagram wouldn't be of much use to a Golden Core level Mechanical Demon General.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng was not a Golden Core level demon cultivator; his outward display had always been at the Foundation Establishment Stage.<br/>
<br/>
Before he revealed his demonic cultivation, even the entire Monkey Head Gang believed he had no cultivation at all.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, Zhu Xuanji led three Golden Core ancestors into the depths of Fire Persimmon Mountain to fight those Fire Fusion Demon Apes.<br/>
<br/>
Those Fire Fusion Demon Apes were all demon beasts, relying on their formidable bodies to possess Golden Core level combat power without practicing any cultivation techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng gave outsiders the same impression; he was merely a demon beast raised by Yuan Yi, not a demon cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
"Yuan Dasheng, at most, had the combat power of a quasi-Golden Core level before his death. If he had mastered a Golden Core level true scripture, why didn't he cultivate it?"<br/>
<br/>
"If he had cultivated it and possessed a Golden Core level true scripture, how could he still be at the Foundation Establishment Stage?"<br/>
<br/>
"If he were a Golden Core level demon cultivator, he wouldn't have been unable to protect Yuan Er and save his own life."<br/>
<br/>
Although Zhu Xuanji observed Yuan Dasheng at the Fire Persimmon Festival and noticed he had some demonic cultivation foundation, Zhu Xuanji knew very well that this foundation was far from reaching the Golden Core level!<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Zhu Xuanji's mind was filled with chaotic thoughts, constantly surging.<br/>
<br/>
Scenes from past memories frequently flashed in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
He seemed to return to the day of the Fire Persimmon Festival, under the vision of his Heavenly Golden Eyes, where he saw Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng wanted to activate his demonic cultivation but forcibly suppressed it, ultimately not using it.<br/>
<br/>
He was gravely injured and on the brink of death; if not for Zhu Xuanji's intervention, he would have died long ago!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji also recalled when he, along with the Golden Core ancestors of the Zhou family and Fei Si, lifted the roof and broke into Chen Cha's Mechanical Workshop.<br/>
<br/>
The three of them examined Yuan Dasheng's corpse separately and found that the body had just begun to be processed, but the blood inside had already been drained.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Zhu Xuanji felt a slight nausea and couldn't help but think, "Many components in the Mechanical Demon General are related to essence blood."<br/>
<br/>
"The demonic cultivation on the Blood Path Diagram likely specializes in essence blood."<br/>
<br/>
"But when we arrived at the workshop, Yuan Dasheng was already dead, and all his essence blood had been extracted."<br/>
<br/>
"This action was really fast."<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng, the demonic true scripture related to essence blood, and a key figure at the third level of Qi Refining, a young cultivator, a small character—Ning Zhuo!<br/>
<br/>
"Good, a fine little character Ning Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
"I, Zhu Xuanji, was actually deceived by you."<br/>
<br/>
Realizing this, Zhu Xuanji immediately put away the Mechanical Demon General, broke through the roof, and soared into the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's soul returned to his body, descending to his underground secret chamber.<br/>
<br/>
He activated the Floating Cloud Cloak, enveloping himself in layers of white clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after.<br/>
<br/>
Within the embrace of the floating clouds, Ning Zhuo's face was filled with hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
After his soul returned to his body, he began to study the Foundation Establishment method without delay.<br/>
<br/>
Upon careful examination, he found that this Foundation Establishment method differed significantly from what he had imagined.<br/>
<br/>
"The Foundation Establishment method I obtained focuses on the Divine Sea as the primary point, with the other two dantians as support, to achieve Foundation Establishment."<br/>
<br/>
"But according to my previous understanding, shouldn't the three dantians be equally important, without prioritizing one over the others, and then breaking through simultaneously?"<br/>
<br/>
"The Foundation Establishment method I obtained clearly prioritizes the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, with the other two techniques as support."<br/>
<br/>
"Is this the true arrangement of the three sects? Or are there two other Foundation Establishment methods with different focal points?"<br/>
<br/>
"Next time I explore the Immortal Palace, should I ask the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit?"<br/>
<br/>
"If I can't contact it, then I need to clear the other two paths and collect all the Foundation Establishment methods to uncover the truth."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had a feeling that his guess was correct.<br/>
<br/>
Only by collecting all the Foundation Establishment methods and integrating them could he achieve true simultaneous Foundation Establishment in all three dantians!<br/>
<br/>
"If I had known this, I should have asked the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit earlier." Ning Zhuo sighed.<br/>
<br/>
His plan to break through to the Foundation Establishment Stage had to be postponed.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, deep within the main hall of the Immortal Palace, also sighed.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo's soul returned to his body and left the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit focused its attention on him.<br/>
<br/>
It didn't forcefully spy on Ning Zhuo to avoid triggering the intense consumption of the floating clouds.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit sighed in its heart, "The true Foundation Establishment method is probably not something Ning Zhuo can be deceived about."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's guess was correct!<br/>
<br/>
The true and complete Foundation Establishment method required trial disciples to fully clear all three paths, gather all three parts, and integrate them to achieve true simultaneous Foundation Establishment in all three dantians.<br/>
<br/>
This didn't mean that the method Ning Zhuo currently possessed was incomplete.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, he could still use it.<br/>
<br/>
This arrangement was deliberately set by the three sects.<br/>
<br/>
This method was mainly suitable for those who had cleared the Buddhist Gate path but had little talent in the other two paths.<br/>
<br/>
For these people, they could still use this method to achieve Foundation Establishment and not be stuck, unable to proceed with their cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
When the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit communicated with Ning Zhuo, it deliberately avoided this topic.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, Ning Zhuo hadn't delved deeply into the Foundation Establishment method and hadn't noticed this issue, allowing the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit to temporarily deceive him.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew the inside story: only by gathering the complete Foundation Establishment method could one achieve true simultaneous Foundation Establishment in all three dantians.<br/>
<br/>
Such Foundation Establishment cultivators would receive close attention and strong support from the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
In short, those who achieved true simultaneous Foundation Establishment in all three dantians were the true transmission seeds prepared by the Lava Immortal Palace!<br/>
<br/>
Deep within the floating clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo temporarily set aside the Foundation Establishment method and quietly sensed the Medical Pavilion Master's Token in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
This official waist token was actually a magical artifact.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, it could be directly stored in Ning Zhuo's dantian for nurturing.<br/>
<br/>
By communicating with the Medical Pavilion Master's Token, Ning Zhuo could immediately sense the Medical Pavilion of the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he could vaguely sense the general situation of his subordinates.<br/>
<br/>
When he sensed Ning Xiaohui and the huge ice block in front of her, the next moment, Ning Xiaohui extended her delicate jade finger and lightly tapped the surface of the ice block.<br/>
<br/>
The ice block suddenly shattered, and the Golden Blood Battle Ape was restored to its original state, fully recovered!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo couldn't help but sincerely admire, "The Ice Jade Hand is truly an extraordinary talent."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, Ning Xiaohui has been a great help."<br/>
<br/>
Talent! It is the soil for divine abilities, and divine abilities are the deep application of the principles of heaven and earth.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, talent is both unreasonable and the most reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to Ning Zhuo, Ning Xiaohui understood even less about the structure of the Golden Blood Battle Ape.<br/>
<br/>
But relying on her talent, she could still repair it!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had gradually learned through various channels a lot of information about the Ice Jade Hand.<br/>
<br/>
"The essence of the Ice Jade Hand is to find life in the face of death! It embodies the principle that heaven never seals off all paths."<br/>
<br/>
"Mechanical constructs are inherently lifeless, which unexpectedly aligns with the talent of the Ice Jade Hand, making the treatment far more effective than treating living beings."<br/>
<br/>
"But when will such a talented person like Ning Xiaohui be willing to work for me willingly?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt the immense convenience.<br/>
<br/>
Having a capable subordinate was truly wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
He was now indirectly making Ning Xiaohui work for him by concealing the truth through the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Once Ning Xiaohui knew the truth, she would undoubtedly turn against him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
He knew that his power had increased significantly, but he still couldn't achieve one thing—making talented cultivators willingly work for him!<br/>
<br/>
Most of the people who followed him now valued his talent and the bright future he promised, so they flocked to him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's current subordinates had no talent.<br/>
<br/>
His small force couldn't retain such talents.<br/>
<br/>
The temple was too small to accommodate a big Buddha!<br/>
<br/>
Talented cultivators could gain widespread favor and recruitment, receiving more support and resources in families, sects, and nations, making it impossible for them to stay under Ning Zhuo's command.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's current power was too small, and there was no space for these talents to fully utilize their abilities.<br/>
<br/>
"Unless I obtain the Lava Immortal Palace and become the master of the Immortal Palace!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was dreaming of the future, full of anticipation, completely unaware that Zhu Xuanji had already transformed into a rainbow and was speeding towards him.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's actions were not concealed, attracting the attention of countless cultivators in the city.<br/>
<br/>
Only the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew the whole story.<br/>
<br/>
"Here it comes, here it comes!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely excited.<br/>
<br/>
It lay on the main seat, its eyes glowing, eagerly anticipating the upcoming drama.<br/>
<br/>
In the underground cultivation chamber.<br/>
<br/>
The floating clouds around Ning Zhuo suddenly consumed rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately became alert, put away the floating clouds, activated his defensive measures, and shouted, "Who is it?!"<br/>
<br/>
Boom.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Zhu Xuanji flew to the top of Ning Zhuo's residence.<br/>
<br/>
He extended his hand, palm facing downward, and lightly grabbed and pulled.<br/>
<br/>
An invisible force grabbed the roof and lifted it away.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji then pulled again, lifting the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, who was in the underground chamber, was thus exposed.<br/>
<br/>
"Lord Zhu Xuanji!" Ning Zhuo looked up and saw Zhu Xuanji, his face filled with shock and fear, hurriedly saluting.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji descended from the sky, slowly landing in front of Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
His brows were filled with killing intent, his square face stern.<br/>
<br/>
The center of his pitch-black pupils emitted golden light, clearly activating his Heavenly Golden Eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji wore a bright red brocade robe with black embroidery, and the three large characters "Divine Constable Division" on his waist token were eye-catching, exerting immense psychological pressure on others.</div>
