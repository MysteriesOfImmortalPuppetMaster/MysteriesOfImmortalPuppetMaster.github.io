<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 212: Three Paths to Foundation Establishment</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Yuan Dasheng?!" Zhu Xuanji's pupils contracted slightly as he stood in place, stunned for a good while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Could it really be Yuan Dasheng?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He had considered this possibility before, but as soon as the thought arose, he quickly dismissed it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">In Zhu Xuanji's view, the Mechanical Demon General was undoubtedly at the Golden Core Stage!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Within its body, the true scripture recorded on the Blood Path Diagram should at least be at the Golden Core level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">If it wasn't, then the Blood Path Diagram wouldn't be of much use to a Golden Core level Mechanical Demon General.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Yuan Dasheng was not a Golden Core level demon cultivator; his outward display had always been at the Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Before he revealed his demonic cultivation, even the entire Monkey Head Gang believed he had no cultivation at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Not long ago, Zhu Xuanji led three Golden Core ancestors into the depths of Fire Persimmon Mountain to fight those Fire Fusion Demon Apes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Those Fire Fusion Demon Apes were all demon beasts, relying on their formidable bodies to possess Golden Core level combat power without practicing any cultivation techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Yuan Dasheng gave outsiders the same impression; he was merely a demon beast raised by Yuan Yi, not a demon cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Yuan Dasheng, at most, had the combat power of a quasi-Golden Core level before his death. If he had mastered a Golden Core level true scripture, why didn't he cultivate it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"If he had cultivated it and possessed a Golden Core level true scripture, how could he still be at the Foundation Establishment Stage?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"If he were a Golden Core level demon cultivator, he wouldn't have been unable to protect Yuan Er and save his own life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Although Zhu Xuanji observed Yuan Dasheng at the Fire Persimmon Festival and noticed he had some demonic cultivation foundation, Zhu Xuanji knew very well that this foundation was far from reaching the Golden Core level!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">At this moment, Zhu Xuanji's mind was filled with chaotic thoughts, constantly surging.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Scenes from past memories frequently flashed in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He seemed to return to the day of the Fire Persimmon Festival, under the vision of his Heavenly Golden Eyes, where he saw Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Yuan Dasheng wanted to activate his demonic cultivation but forcibly suppressed it, ultimately not using it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">He was gravely injured and on the brink of death; if not for Zhu Xuanji's intervention, he would have died long ago!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Zhu Xuanji also recalled when he, along with the Golden Core ancestors of the Zhou family and Fei Si, lifted the roof and broke into Chen Cha's Mechanical Workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The three of them examined Yuan Dasheng's corpse separately and found that the body had just begun to be processed, but the blood inside had already been drained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Seeing this, Zhu Xuanji felt a slight nausea and couldn't help but think, "Many components in the Mechanical Demon General are related to essence blood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"The demonic cultivation on the Blood Path Diagram likely specializes in essence blood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"But when we arrived at the workshop, Yuan Dasheng was already dead, and all his essence blood had been extracted."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"This action was really fast."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Yuan Dasheng, the demonic true scripture related to essence blood, and a key figure at the third level of Qi Refining, a young cultivator, a small character—Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Good, a fine little character Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"I, Zhu Xuanji, was actually deceived by you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Realizing this, Zhu Xuanji immediately put away the Mechanical Demon General, broke through the roof, and soared into the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo's soul returned to his body, descending to his underground secret chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He activated the Floating Cloud Cloak, enveloping himself in layers of white clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Not long after.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Within the embrace of the floating clouds, Ning Zhuo's face was filled with hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">After his soul returned to his body, he began to study the Foundation Establishment method without delay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Upon careful examination, he found that this Foundation Establishment method differed significantly from what he had imagined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"The Foundation Establishment method I obtained focuses on the Divine Sea as the primary point, with the other two dantians as support, to achieve Foundation Establishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"But according to my previous understanding, shouldn't the three dantians be equally important, without prioritizing one over the others, and then breaking through simultaneously?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"The Foundation Establishment method I obtained clearly prioritizes the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, with the other two techniques as support."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Is this the true arrangement of the three sects? Or are there two other Foundation Establishment methods with different focal points?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Next time I explore the Immortal Palace, should I ask the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"If I can't contact it, then I need to clear the other two paths and collect all the Foundation Establishment methods to uncover the truth."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo had a feeling that his guess was correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Only by collecting all the Foundation Establishment methods and integrating them could he achieve true simultaneous Foundation Establishment in all three dantians!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"If I had known this, I should have asked the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit earlier." Ning Zhuo sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">His plan to break through to the Foundation Establishment Stage had to be postponed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, deep within the main hall of the Immortal Palace, also sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">After Ning Zhuo's soul returned to his body and left the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit focused its attention on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">It didn't forcefully spy on Ning Zhuo to avoid triggering the intense consumption of the floating clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit sighed in its heart, "The true Foundation Establishment method is probably not something Ning Zhuo can be deceived about."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo's guess was correct!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The true and complete Foundation Establishment method required trial disciples to fully clear all three paths, gather all three parts, and integrate them to achieve true simultaneous Foundation Establishment in all three dantians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">This didn't mean that the method Ning Zhuo currently possessed was incomplete.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In fact, he could still use it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">This arrangement was deliberately set by the three sects.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">This method was mainly suitable for those who had cleared the Buddhist Gate path but had little talent in the other two paths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">For these people, they could still use this method to achieve Foundation Establishment and not be stuck, unable to proceed with their cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">When the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit communicated with Ning Zhuo, it deliberately avoided this topic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">At that time, Ning Zhuo hadn't delved deeply into the Foundation Establishment method and hadn't noticed this issue, allowing the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit to temporarily deceive him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew the inside story: only by gathering the complete Foundation Establishment method could one achieve true simultaneous Foundation Establishment in all three dantians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Such Foundation Establishment cultivators would receive close attention and strong support from the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In short, those who achieved true simultaneous Foundation Establishment in all three dantians were the true transmission seeds prepared by the Lava Immortal Palace!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Deep within the floating clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo temporarily set aside the Foundation Establishment method and quietly sensed the Medical Pavilion Master's Token in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This official waist token was actually a magical artifact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Therefore, it could be directly stored in Ning Zhuo's dantian for nurturing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">By communicating with the Medical Pavilion Master's Token, Ning Zhuo could immediately sense the Medical Pavilion of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">At the same time, he could vaguely sense the general situation of his subordinates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">When he sensed Ning Xiaohui and the huge ice block in front of her, the next moment, Ning Xiaohui extended her delicate jade finger and lightly tapped the surface of the ice block.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The ice block suddenly shattered, and the Golden Blood Battle Ape was restored to its original state, fully recovered!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but sincerely admire, "The Ice Jade Hand is truly an extraordinary talent."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"This time, Ning Xiaohui has been a great help."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Talent! It is the soil for divine abilities, and divine abilities are the deep application of the principles of heaven and earth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Therefore, talent is both unreasonable and the most reasonable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Compared to Ning Zhuo, Ning Xiaohui understood even less about the structure of the Golden Blood Battle Ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">But relying on her talent, she could still repair it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ning Zhuo had gradually learned through various channels a lot of information about the Ice Jade Hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"The essence of the Ice Jade Hand is to find life in the face of death! It embodies the principle that heaven never seals off all paths."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Mechanical constructs are inherently lifeless, which unexpectedly aligns with the talent of the Ice Jade Hand, making the treatment far more effective than treating living beings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"But when will such a talented person like Ning Xiaohui be willing to work for me willingly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ning Zhuo felt the immense convenience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Having a capable subordinate was truly wonderful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">He was now indirectly making Ning Xiaohui work for him by concealing the truth through the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Once Ning Xiaohui knew the truth, she would undoubtedly turn against him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Zhuo sighed in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He knew that his power had increased significantly, but he still couldn't achieve one thing—making talented cultivators willingly work for him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Most of the people who followed him now valued his talent and the bright future he promised, so they flocked to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Ning Zhuo's current subordinates had no talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">His small force couldn't retain such talents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">The temple was too small to accommodate a big Buddha!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Talented cultivators could gain widespread favor and recruitment, receiving more support and resources in families, sects, and nations, making it impossible for them to stay under Ning Zhuo's command.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo's current power was too small, and there was no space for these talents to fully utilize their abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"Unless I obtain the Lava Immortal Palace and become the master of the Immortal Palace!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Ning Zhuo was dreaming of the future, full of anticipation, completely unaware that Zhu Xuanji had already transformed into a rainbow and was speeding towards him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Zhu Xuanji's actions were not concealed, attracting the attention of countless cultivators in the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Only the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew the whole story.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Here it comes, here it comes!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was extremely excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">It lay on the main seat, its eyes glowing, eagerly anticipating the upcoming drama.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In the underground cultivation chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The floating clouds around Ning Zhuo suddenly consumed rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Ning Zhuo immediately became alert, put away the floating clouds, activated his defensive measures, and shouted, "Who is it?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The next moment, Zhu Xuanji flew to the top of Ning Zhuo's residence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He extended his hand, palm facing downward, and lightly grabbed and pulled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">An invisible force grabbed the roof and lifted it away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Zhu Xuanji then pulled again, lifting the floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Ning Zhuo, who was in the underground chamber, was thus exposed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Lord Zhu Xuanji!" Ning Zhuo looked up and saw Zhu Xuanji, his face filled with shock and fear, hurriedly saluting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Zhu Xuanji descended from the sky, slowly landing in front of Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">His brows were filled with killing intent, his square face stern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The center of his pitch-black pupils emitted golden light, clearly activating his Heavenly Golden Eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Zhu Xuanji wore a bright red brocade robe with black embroidery, and the three large characters "Divine Constable Division" on his waist token were eye-catching, exerting immense psychological pressure on others.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
