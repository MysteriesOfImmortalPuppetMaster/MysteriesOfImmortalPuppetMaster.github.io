<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div><br/>
Three venomous serpents of the Golden Core level, each one with a head as massive as an elephant and astonishing speed, charged in pursuit from behind.<br/>
<br/>
Diao Ye shrank into the purple-black poisonous fog and cast a spell, stirring the fog so that it rolled along the ground toward the front lines.<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan held a poison-stinger spear and circled on the periphery, throwing it from time to time. Almost every throw claimed the life of one soldier.<br/>
<br/>
With poisonous fog in front, venomous serpents behind, and Golden Core barbarian cultivators harassing on both flanks, the Three Generals Camp was like a black bear that had stepped into an ambush circle, besieged from all sides.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei could no longer hold back. The veins in his neck bulged, and his hair stood on end in fury. “A bunch of petty scoundrels!”<br/>
<br/>
He brandished the black serpent spear in his hand and directly activated the military tactic contained within the weapon.<br/>
<br/>
Military Tactic —An Army Bearing Down!<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, forty percent of the Three Generals Camp’s military strength, along with Zhang Hei’s own spiritual energy, was depleted and condensed into one black-water soldier after another.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers surged and flooded out like a tide, rushing in all directions.<br/>
<br/>
They collided with the purple-black poisonous fog. Although each one dissolved almost immediately, they also offset a great portion of the fog, causing it to disperse rapidly around the Three Generals Camp. The area became clear, and the crisis was temporarily relieved.<br/>
<br/>
The soldiers continued their charge toward Diao Ye. Under the tremendous pressure, he had no choice but to retreat again and again.<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan let out a shout and darted around. Feeling the invisible pressure bearing down on him, he struggled against it, forced to fall back.<br/>
<br/>
His face was a purplish brown, and he kept throwing poison-stinger spears from his hand as soon as he formed them.<br/>
<br/>
Yet those spears were pressed down to the ground mid-flight by the invisible oppressive force, achieving no results.<br/>
<br/>
More soldiers formed a pitch-black wave and surged toward the three Golden Core-level venomous serpents.<br/>
<br/>
The serpents hissed, opening their massive mouths to devour soldier after soldier. Their tails swept across, shattering a row of soldiers in a single blow and clearing a large patch of ground.<br/>
<br/>
When soldiers’ weapons stabbed into the serpents, they opened wounds that spewed forth large amounts of toxic fluid. The fluid splashed over the nearby soldiers, dissolving and poisoning them on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Though these conjured soldiers were no match for the venomous serpents one-on-one, they won through sheer numbers. Wave after wave kept advancing endlessly.<br/>
<br/>
The serpents’ forward charge was successfully stalled, and as the intense battle continued, their colossal bodies slowly began to shrink. Their auras dropped from their peak, gradually weakening.<br/>
<br/>
“General Zhang is mighty!”<br/>
<br/>
“Hurrah!”<br/>
<br/>
The real soldiers of the Three Generals Camp cheered. Their morale was steadied, and their military strength recovered more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Wu Lan felt bitter resentment welling up, his face brimming with malevolence.<br/>
<br/>
Poison Art —Poisoned Stinger Piercing the Heart!<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan stretched out his five fingers and grasped at the air, once again condensing a spear of poison with his spiritual energy, catching it in his right hand.<br/>
<br/>
However, this time the poison spear was far smaller than the ones before, no longer than a chopstick.<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan’s eyes almost bulged from his sockets as he fixed his gaze on the Three Generals Camp. His expression twisted, his eyes shot with blood.<br/>
<br/>
He extended his left hand, palm facing upward.<br/>
<br/>
His left palm was pitch-black, with lines glowing red. That bloody light flowed along the palm lines and gathered in the center, taking the shape of a heart.<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan gripped the small poison spear tightly in his right hand, then drove it savagely into the heart-shaped glow at the center of his left palm.<br/>
<br/>
The spear pierced through the bloody light in his palm without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan’s expression did not change; he merely grunted once.<br/>
<br/>
By contrast, many of the soldiers clutched their chests and let out screams of agonizing pain.<br/>
<br/>
They often managed only a single cry before collapsing on the ground, succumbing to the poison on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Without any visible attack, their comrades fell in this bizarre, miserable way, striking terror into those still alive. Morale in the Three Generals Camp wavered.<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan withdrew the spear from his left palm as soon as he impaled it, then immediately stabbed the palm’s center again for the second time.<br/>
<br/>
Blood splattered, and fresh waves of pain flared.<br/>
<br/>
Simultaneously, more soldiers in the Three Generals Camp sustained casualties.<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan kept stabbing his own left palm over and over, moving swiftly, his eyes fierce. The brows he had furrowed before slowly relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
The unending pain washed through him, yet he quickly adapted—going from mere endurance to actual relish.<br/>
<br/>
He had stabbed more than a dozen holes in his left palm. The palm was on the verge of being entirely mangled.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he had caused the highest number of casualties so far; at least eighty soldiers had died because of it.<br/>
<br/>
“Heart-poison?!” Liu Er observed the corpses closely, employing both his spiritual sense and innate talents before finally discovering the source of their deaths.<br/>
<br/>
A sense of helplessness rose in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Relying on his own protective methods to defend against such a strange attack was exceedingly difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Innate Talent—Purple-Beard Swift Strike!<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong made a sudden move.<br/>
<br/>
He wildly activated the Crimson-Faced Blood Calamity Scripture. His entire body radiated a bloody glow.<br/>
<br/>
The red radiance was so intense that it glowed purple.<br/>
<br/>
That purple light shone brightly and fell directly upon Wu Lan, freezing his movements in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
Military Tactic —Single Blade Thrust!<br/>
<br/>
This was a tactic inherent to the Blood Dragon Saber, allowing Guan Hong to strike with sudden ferocity, often seizing the initiative.<br/>
<br/>
A blade of scarlet energy took form, flashing forward at lightning speed, arriving in front of Wu Lan before he could react.<br/>
<br/>
“Damnit!” Wu Lan’s face was paralyzed, but his emotional state continued to change.<br/>
<br/>
A powerful terror coursed through him.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, venomous liquid swirled up from beneath his feet and quickly formed a spherical shield, giving him extra protection.<br/>
<br/>
Innate Talent —A Thousand Whiskers Reflected in Blood!<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong’s face hardened. His eight-foot-long beard snapped several strands.<br/>
<br/>
Those severed strands of beard reverted into a surge of pure blood, which poured directly into the Blood Dragon Saber.<br/>
<br/>
The saber’s power exploded dramatically, driving the crimson blade energy to become even more forceful and piercing.<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Dragon Saber’s slash broke through the pitch-black layer of poisonous liquid and, still unstoppable, cleaved Wu Lan into two halves!<br/>
<br/>
The “Wu Lan” it struck dissolved into two pools of poisonous fluid and splattered onto the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Originally certain of his strike, Guan Hong now showed a trace of surprise.<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, Wu Lan emerged from a nearby puddle of poisonous liquid. His whole body was soaked as he knelt on the ground, once again staring at Guan Hong, his face filled with lingering dread.<br/>
<br/>
Moments before, in direct confrontation with Guan Hong, he had been nearly powerless.<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong’s innate talents combined to unleash extreme power in a split second, making it very difficult to withstand.<br/>
<br/>
Wu Lan believed his combat prowess at Golden Core level to be fairly impressive.<br/>
<br/>
Yet at this moment, compared with Guan Hong, he realized that he was far inferior!<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong, however, did not look at him. Instead, his gaze fell on Tu Ming in the distance.<br/>
<br/>
The one who had rescued Wu Lan a moment before was none other than the Hundred Poisons Tribe’s Venom-Gut High Priest!<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming stood seven feet tall, with bronze skin and a muscular build.<br/>
<br/>
He wore animal hides and went barefoot, a dead serpent draped around his body.<br/>
<br/>
Numerous ornaments fashioned from snake bones and viper scales adorned him from head to toe.<br/>
<br/>
Around his neck hung a necklace made of snake fangs and various poison sacs.<br/>
<br/>
Up to this point in the battle, Tu Ming had witnessed the renewed fighting strength of the Three Generals Camp and realized he could not easily defeat them without revealing some of his deeper resources and paying a certain price.<br/>
<br/>
So he tore off one of the poison sacs from the necklace around his neck and channeled spiritual energy into it.<br/>
<br/>
The sac reverted to palm-size in the Venom-Gut High Priest’s hand.<br/>
<br/>
He pressed his five fingers into it, repeatedly kneading.<br/>
<br/>
Poison oozed out of the sac, releasing a yellowish-brown toxic gas.<br/>
<br/>
Poison Art —Rotten Flesh Sores!<br/>
<br/>
The toxic gas spread rapidly. No matter what methods the Three Generals or Ning Zhuo employed, they could not fully disperse it.<br/>
<br/>
Before long, some wisps of toxic gas were inhaled by certain soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
Those soldiers began screaming in torment, clawing at their skin.<br/>
<br/>
Poisonous sores erupted on their flesh, itching atrociously.<br/>
<br/>
But if they scratched the sores open, pus would ooze from inside, corroding the surrounding healthy skin and greatly enlarging the sores.<br/>
<br/>
The sores soon spread all over their bodies, making large swaths of flesh rot away and exposing white bone before they died in wretched fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Even the Three Generals felt their skin itching all over, with poisonous sores forming.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang immediately tried their own methods of healing. Yet every attempt was futile and only caused the affliction to worsen!<br/>
<br/>
All three turned pale in quick succession.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming sneered. “My Poison Art, Rotten Flesh Sores, specifically restrains those with body-refining heritage. The stronger your physical foundation, the harder it is to stop the spread of the sores, and the faster the corrosion accelerates.”<br/>
<br/>
“Savor it well, Liu, Guan, and Zhang!”<br/>
<br/>
“This time is not the same as the previous ambush.”<br/>
<br/>
“You have no reinforcements! Even if you call for help, the other three divisions are surely struggling just to save themselves.”<br/>
<br/>
Under Lu Hongtu’s planning, the Thousand Peaks Forest side had developed a precise counterattack.<br/>
<br/>
Tu Ming, Diao Ye, and Wu Lan were merely one of the enemy strike forces.<br/>
<br/>
On the Azure Sky Giant Wood Mountain:<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Halberd Army, halfway around the mountain, had been attacked by packs of wolves.<br/>
<br/>
Wolves filled the area like a raging tide, wave after wave assaulting the Golden Halberd Army.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan, armored from head to toe, wore a cold and proud expression. “Just your old trick again?”<br/>
<br/>
“Gu Ya, you seem to be mistaking my Golden Halberd Army for the Barbarian Demon Camp.”<br/>
<br/>
“How could a mere wolf pack halt my Golden Halberd Army?!”<br/>
<br/>
With that, he activated his military tactics and maintained the battle formation, leading the Golden Halberd Army to charge forward boldly, forging ahead with unstoppable momentum.<br/>
<br/>
They were like a razor-sharp halberd of gold, cleaving through the oncoming torrents of wolves—blue-gray waves of fur—without hindrance.<br/>
<br/>
Wherever they went, the unleashed tactics tore through the enemy, and countless wolves fell and died.<br/>
<br/>
“Unless you deploy those few Golden Core-level wolves of yours,” Sun Gan taunted Gu Ya in the distance with merciless ridicule, “sending wave after wave of rank-and-file wolves is merely throwing them away for nothing.”<br/>
<br/>
The terrible losses among the wolves left Gu Ya seething with anger. He gnashed his teeth. “Sun Gan, do you really think I’m the main threat? I’m only here to tie up your army!”<br/>
<br/>
“The real challenge for you is someone else!”<br/>
<br/>
At his words, the invisibility that had cloaked the figure behind him gradually dissipated, revealing a Nascent Soul-level powerhouse who had been concealed until now.<br/>
<br/>
He had a towering physique, his chest broad as a city gate. He had the head of an elephant on a human body, with limbs thick as tree trunks and skin of a pale blue hue.<br/>
<br/>
A pair of snow-white tusks, curved like two crescent moons, jutted from either side of his trunk, resembling two curved blades.<br/>
<br/>
“The current Elephant King?!” Seeing this silent giant demon, Sun Gan’s heart skipped a beat.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
The Elephant King came crashing into the Golden Halberd Army’s formation like a falling mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan was driven back from the very front of the ranks all the way to the middle by the Elephant King’s charge.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Gan’s nose and mouth bled. Slowly lifting his gaze, he found the towering Elephant King looming overhead beneath the blazing midday sun, looking down on him without mercy.<br/>
<br/>
On the Moon Hook Giant Wood Mountain:<br/>
<br/>
The enemy abruptly appeared at the mountaintop.<br/>
<br/>
He wore a black cloth over his eyes, his upper body exposed and painted with a fresh-blood totem, twin crescent blades strapped to his back.<br/>
<br/>
This was Di Lu!<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Camp hastened to form ranks.<br/>
<br/>
They had just managed to condense the Red Flower Avatar overhead when suddenly the world changed!<br/>
<br/>
The once-clear midday sky became a dark night.<br/>
<br/>
Under that deep night sky, a thin crescent moon hung like a hook.<br/>
<br/>
With a single slight sway, that crescent hooked away the half-formed Red Flower Avatar over the Red Flower Camp’s ranks!<br/>
<br/>
The avatar was lifted into the night sky, its source cut off, and it began to dissipate rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Flower Camp fell into turmoil.<br/>
<br/>
Even the veteran soldiers were facing this type of dire situation for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
“Steady yourselves!” Mu Lan shouted, activating her techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Military Tactic —Morale Boost!<br/>
<br/>
After stabilizing their formation, Mu Lan once again directed her soldiers, trying to form a second Red Flower Avatar.<br/>
<br/>
But before it was fully shaped, the crescent moon glimmered again, hooking away the second avatar!<br/>
<br/>
Morale in the Red Flower Camp plunged once more. Even Mu Lan herself rarely displayed such concern, yet now her brows were knitted tight.<br/>
<br/>
She had not expected that the Thousand Peaks Forest could suppress the Red Flower Formation so thoroughly!<br/>
<br/>
“This is a domain!”<br/>
<br/>
“The ancient god worshiped by the Azure Moon Tribe has finally intervened.”<br/>
<br/>
Mu Lan swiftly deduced the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, only cultivators at the Void Refinement stage or higher could create their own domain.<br/>
<br/>
But exceptions existed as well.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest exceptions were gods.<br/>
<br/>
Gods could inherently control certain laws of nature. If they reached the level of a fully awakened divinity, it was called a divine ability!<br/>
<br/>
By manifesting their control and understanding of the laws, gods could transform the surrounding world to form a domain.<br/>
<br/>
The Dice-Bone Demon God and the Ancient God of the Azure Moon were prime examples.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, Mu Lan was at a loss.<br/>
<br/>
Within the domain of the Ancient God of the Azure Moon, unique rules prevailed.<br/>
<br/>
Though she had not fully probed its limits yet, it was already clear that the Red Flower Avatar could not be completed.<br/>
<br/>
“This is going to be an extremely hard-fought battle!” Mu Lan’s face was pale, her mood grim.<br/>
<br/>
On the Pig Hair Giant Wood Mountain:<br/>
<br/>
The Barbarian Demon Camp had likewise run into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
A wave of boars stormed out!<br/>
<br/>
The swine crashed forward in a flood, emerging steadily from the sparse forest, slamming into the Barbarian Demon Camp.<br/>
<br/>
Trenches were filled in, ditches leveled, barriers and caltrops smashed by charging boars.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali had long since gone out to the battlefield, shouting a challenge to Ju Bing, the culprit behind the boar hordes.<br/>
<br/>
Ju Bing, alongside Gu Ya, was one of the two greatest beast tamers of the Thousand Peaks Forest.<br/>
<br/>
Gu Ya was adept at controlling wolves, while Ju Bing specialized in boars.<br/>
<br/>
Facing Xu Dali’s insults, Ju Bing crossed his arms with a look of total indifference.<br/>
<br/>
In his view, it would be foolish for a beast tamer like him to engage in single combat with a physically powerful general.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Dali soon found himself in dire straits.<br/>
<br/>
As Ju Bing retreated, the boars continued to assault the camp, inflicting huge casualties on the Barbarian Demon Camp.<br/>
<br/>
If the situation went on like this, it would lead to a crushing defeat and a disastrous rout for them.<br/>
<br/>
This scene did not escape the notice of certain onlookers.<br/>
<br/>
“That Xu Dali truly is a simple brute. He has a whole army, yet he’s hardly using them. He’s just borrowing a bit of strength and then fighting alone!”<br/>
<br/>
“At this rate, the Barbarian Demon Camp will be breached by the boar herd soon, and they’ll all fall to pieces.”<br/>
<br/>
“Not necessarily.”<br/>
<br/>
“You’ve forgotten something important.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Barbarian Demon Camp took heavy losses and had to recruit fresh troops on a large scale. Most of these soldiers come from various barbarian tribes or demon cultivators. Due to their intelligence, customs, and other factors, they need extensive real training. Otherwise, they’re just cannon fodder in battle!”<br/>
<br/>
“It’s about time for us to step in!”</div></body></html></div>
