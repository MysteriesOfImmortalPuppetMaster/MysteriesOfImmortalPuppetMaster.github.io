<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Three venomous serpents of the Golden Core level, each one with a head as massive as an elephant and astonishing speed, charged in pursuit from behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Diao Ye shrank into the purple-black poisonous fog and cast a spell, stirring the fog so that it rolled along the ground toward the front lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Wu Lan held a poison-stinger spear and circled on the periphery, throwing it from time to time. Almost every throw claimed the life of one soldier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">With poisonous fog in front, venomous serpents behind, and Golden Core barbarian cultivators harassing on both flanks, the Three Generals Camp was like a black bear that had stepped into an ambush circle, besieged from all sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Zhang Hei could no longer hold back. The veins in his neck bulged, and his hair stood on end in fury. ‚ÄúA bunch of petty scoundrels!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He brandished the black serpent spear in his hand and directly activated the military tactic contained within the weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Military Tactic ‚ÄîAn Army Bearing Down!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">In an instant, forty percent of the Three Generals Camp‚Äôs military strength, along with Zhang Hei‚Äôs own spiritual energy, was depleted and condensed into one black-water soldier after another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The soldiers surged and flooded out like a tide, rushing in all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">They collided with the purple-black poisonous fog. Although each one dissolved almost immediately, they also offset a great portion of the fog, causing it to disperse rapidly around the Three Generals Camp. The area became clear, and the crisis was temporarily relieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The soldiers continued their charge toward Diao Ye. Under the tremendous pressure, he had no choice but to retreat again and again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Wu Lan let out a shout and darted around. Feeling the invisible pressure bearing down on him, he struggled against it, forced to fall back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">His face was a purplish brown, and he kept throwing poison-stinger spears from his hand as soon as he formed them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Yet those spears were pressed down to the ground mid-flight by the invisible oppressive force, achieving no results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">More soldiers formed a pitch-black wave and surged toward the three Golden Core-level venomous serpents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The serpents hissed, opening their massive mouths to devour soldier after soldier. Their tails swept across, shattering a row of soldiers in a single blow and clearing a large patch of ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">When soldiers‚Äô weapons stabbed into the serpents, they opened wounds that spewed forth large amounts of toxic fluid. The fluid splashed over the nearby soldiers, dissolving and poisoning them on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Though these conjured soldiers were no match for the venomous serpents one-on-one, they won through sheer numbers. Wave after wave kept advancing endlessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The serpents‚Äô forward charge was successfully stalled, and as the intense battle continued, their colossal bodies slowly began to shrink. Their auras dropped from their peak, gradually weakening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">‚ÄúGeneral Zhang is mighty!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">‚ÄúHurrah!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The real soldiers of the Three Generals Camp cheered. Their morale was steadied, and their military strength recovered more quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Seeing this, Wu Lan felt bitter resentment welling up, his face brimming with malevolence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Poison Art ‚ÄîPoisoned Stinger Piercing the Heart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Wu Lan stretched out his five fingers and grasped at the air, once again condensing a spear of poison with his spiritual energy, catching it in his right hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">However, this time the poison spear was far smaller than the ones before, no longer than a chopstick.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Wu Lan‚Äôs eyes almost bulged from his sockets as he fixed his gaze on the Three Generals Camp. His expression twisted, his eyes shot with blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He extended his left hand, palm facing upward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">His left palm was pitch-black, with lines glowing red. That bloody light flowed along the palm lines and gathered in the center, taking the shape of a heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Wu Lan gripped the small poison spear tightly in his right hand, then drove it savagely into the heart-shaped glow at the center of his left palm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The spear pierced through the bloody light in his palm without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Wu Lan‚Äôs expression did not change; he merely grunted once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">By contrast, many of the soldiers clutched their chests and let out screams of agonizing pain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">They often managed only a single cry before collapsing on the ground, succumbing to the poison on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Without any visible attack, their comrades fell in this bizarre, miserable way, striking terror into those still alive. Morale in the Three Generals Camp wavered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Wu Lan withdrew the spear from his left palm as soon as he impaled it, then immediately stabbed the palm‚Äôs center again for the second time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Blood splattered, and fresh waves of pain flared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Simultaneously, more soldiers in the Three Generals Camp sustained casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Wu Lan kept stabbing his own left palm over and over, moving swiftly, his eyes fierce. The brows he had furrowed before slowly relaxed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The unending pain washed through him, yet he quickly adapted‚Äîgoing from mere endurance to actual relish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He had stabbed more than a dozen holes in his left palm. The palm was on the verge of being entirely mangled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">At the same time, he had caused the highest number of casualties so far; at least eighty soldiers had died because of it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">‚ÄúHeart-poison?!‚Äù Liu Er observed the corpses closely, employing both his spiritual sense and innate talents before finally discovering the source of their deaths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">A sense of helplessness rose in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Relying on his own protective methods to defend against such a strange attack was exceedingly difficult.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Innate Talent‚ÄîPurple-Beard Swift Strike!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Guan Hong made a sudden move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">He wildly activated the Crimson-Faced Blood Calamity Scripture. His entire body radiated a bloody glow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The red radiance was so intense that it glowed purple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">That purple light shone brightly and fell directly upon Wu Lan, freezing his movements in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Military Tactic ‚ÄîSingle Blade Thrust!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">This was a tactic inherent to the Blood Dragon Saber, allowing Guan Hong to strike with sudden ferocity, often seizing the initiative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">A blade of scarlet energy took form, flashing forward at lightning speed, arriving in front of Wu Lan before he could react.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">‚ÄúDamnit!‚Äù Wu Lan‚Äôs face was paralyzed, but his emotional state continued to change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">A powerful terror coursed through him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But in the next moment, venomous liquid swirled up from beneath his feet and quickly formed a spherical shield, giving him extra protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Innate Talent ‚ÄîA Thousand Whiskers Reflected in Blood!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Guan Hong‚Äôs face hardened. His eight-foot-long beard snapped several strands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Those severed strands of beard reverted into a surge of pure blood, which poured directly into the Blood Dragon Saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The saber‚Äôs power exploded dramatically, driving the crimson blade energy to become even more forceful and piercing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Blood Dragon Saber‚Äôs slash broke through the pitch-black layer of poisonous liquid and, still unstoppable, cleaved Wu Lan into two halves!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The ‚ÄúWu Lan‚Äù it struck dissolved into two pools of poisonous fluid and splattered onto the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Originally certain of his strike, Guan Hong now showed a trace of surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">In the next instant, Wu Lan emerged from a nearby puddle of poisonous liquid. His whole body was soaked as he knelt on the ground, once again staring at Guan Hong, his face filled with lingering dread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Moments before, in direct confrontation with Guan Hong, he had been nearly powerless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Guan Hong‚Äôs innate talents combined to unleash extreme power in a split second, making it very difficult to withstand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Wu Lan believed his combat prowess at Golden Core level to be fairly impressive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Yet at this moment, compared with Guan Hong, he realized that he was far inferior!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Guan Hong, however, did not look at him. Instead, his gaze fell on Tu Ming in the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">The one who had rescued Wu Lan a moment before was none other than the Hundred Poisons Tribe‚Äôs Venom-Gut High Priest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Tu Ming stood seven feet tall, with bronze skin and a muscular build.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">He wore animal hides and went barefoot, a dead serpent draped around his body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Numerous ornaments fashioned from snake bones and viper scales adorned him from head to toe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Around his neck hung a necklace made of snake fangs and various poison sacs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Up to this point in the battle, Tu Ming had witnessed the renewed fighting strength of the Three Generals Camp and realized he could not easily defeat them without revealing some of his deeper resources and paying a certain price.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">So he tore off one of the poison sacs from the necklace around his neck and channeled spiritual energy into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The sac reverted to palm-size in the Venom-Gut High Priest‚Äôs hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He pressed his five fingers into it, repeatedly kneading.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Poison oozed out of the sac, releasing a yellowish-brown toxic gas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Poison Art ‚ÄîRotten Flesh Sores!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The toxic gas spread rapidly. No matter what methods the Three Generals or Ning Zhuo employed, they could not fully disperse it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Before long, some wisps of toxic gas were inhaled by certain soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Those soldiers began screaming in torment, clawing at their skin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Poisonous sores erupted on their flesh, itching atrociously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">But if they scratched the sores open, pus would ooze from inside, corroding the surrounding healthy skin and greatly enlarging the sores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The sores soon spread all over their bodies, making large swaths of flesh rot away and exposing white bone before they died in wretched fashion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Even the Three Generals felt their skin itching all over, with poisonous sores forming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Liu, Guan, and Zhang immediately tried their own methods of healing. Yet every attempt was futile and only caused the affliction to worsen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">All three turned pale in quick succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Tu Ming sneered. ‚ÄúMy Poison Art, Rotten Flesh Sores, specifically restrains those with body-refining heritage. The stronger your physical foundation, the harder it is to stop the spread of the sores, and the faster the corrosion accelerates.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">‚ÄúSavor it well, Liu, Guan, and Zhang!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">‚ÄúThis time is not the same as the previous ambush.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">‚ÄúYou have no reinforcements! Even if you call for help, the other three divisions are surely struggling just to save themselves.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Under Lu Hongtu‚Äôs planning, the Thousand Peaks Forest side had developed a precise counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Tu Ming, Diao Ye, and Wu Lan were merely one of the enemy strike forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">On the Azure Sky Giant Wood Mountain:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The Golden Halberd Army, halfway around the mountain, had been attacked by packs of wolves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Wolves filled the area like a raging tide, wave after wave assaulting the Golden Halberd Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sun Gan, armored from head to toe, wore a cold and proud expression. ‚ÄúJust your old trick again?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">‚ÄúGu Ya, you seem to be mistaking my Golden Halberd Army for the Barbarian Demon Camp.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">‚ÄúHow could a mere wolf pack halt my Golden Halberd Army?!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">With that, he activated his military tactics and maintained the battle formation, leading the Golden Halberd Army to charge forward boldly, forging ahead with unstoppable momentum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">They were like a razor-sharp halberd of gold, cleaving through the oncoming torrents of wolves‚Äîblue-gray waves of fur‚Äîwithout hindrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Wherever they went, the unleashed tactics tore through the enemy, and countless wolves fell and died.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">‚ÄúUnless you deploy those few Golden Core-level wolves of yours,‚Äù Sun Gan taunted Gu Ya in the distance with merciless ridicule, ‚Äúsending wave after wave of rank-and-file wolves is merely throwing them away for nothing.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The terrible losses among the wolves left Gu Ya seething with anger. He gnashed his teeth. ‚ÄúSun Gan, do you really think I‚Äôm the main threat? I‚Äôm only here to tie up your army!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">‚ÄúThe real challenge for you is someone else!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">At his words, the invisibility that had cloaked the figure behind him gradually dissipated, revealing a Nascent Soul-level powerhouse who had been concealed until now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">He had a towering physique, his chest broad as a city gate. He had the head of an elephant on a human body, with limbs thick as tree trunks and skin of a pale blue hue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">A pair of snow-white tusks, curved like two crescent moons, jutted from either side of his trunk, resembling two curved blades.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">‚ÄúThe current Elephant King?!‚Äù Seeing this silent giant demon, Sun Gan‚Äôs heart skipped a beat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Elephant King came crashing into the Golden Halberd Army‚Äôs formation like a falling mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Sun Gan was driven back from the very front of the ranks all the way to the middle by the Elephant King‚Äôs charge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Sun Gan‚Äôs nose and mouth bled. Slowly lifting his gaze, he found the towering Elephant King looming overhead beneath the blazing midday sun, looking down on him without mercy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">On the Moon Hook Giant Wood Mountain:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The enemy abruptly appeared at the mountaintop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">He wore a black cloth over his eyes, his upper body exposed and painted with a fresh-blood totem, twin crescent blades strapped to his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">This was Di Lu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The Red Flower Camp hastened to form ranks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">They had just managed to condense the Red Flower Avatar overhead when suddenly the world changed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">The once-clear midday sky became a dark night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Under that deep night sky, a thin crescent moon hung like a hook.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">With a single slight sway, that crescent hooked away the half-formed Red Flower Avatar over the Red Flower Camp‚Äôs ranks!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The avatar was lifted into the night sky, its source cut off, and it began to dissipate rapidly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The Red Flower Camp fell into turmoil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Even the veteran soldiers were facing this type of dire situation for the first time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">‚ÄúSteady yourselves!‚Äù Mu Lan shouted, activating her techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Military Tactic ‚ÄîMorale Boost!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">After stabilizing their formation, Mu Lan once again directed her soldiers, trying to form a second Red Flower Avatar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">But before it was fully shaped, the crescent moon glimmered again, hooking away the second avatar!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Morale in the Red Flower Camp plunged once more. Even Mu Lan herself rarely displayed such concern, yet now her brows were knitted tight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">She had not expected that the Thousand Peaks Forest could suppress the Red Flower Formation so thoroughly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">‚ÄúThis is a domain!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">‚ÄúThe ancient god worshiped by the Azure Moon Tribe has finally intervened.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Mu Lan swiftly deduced the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Generally speaking, only cultivators at the Void Refinement stage or higher could create their own domain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">But exceptions existed as well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The greatest exceptions were gods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Gods could inherently control certain laws of nature. If they reached the level of a fully awakened divinity, it was called a divine ability!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">By manifesting their control and understanding of the laws, gods could transform the surrounding world to form a domain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">The Dice-Bone Demon God and the Ancient God of the Azure Moon were prime examples.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">For a moment, Mu Lan was at a loss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Within the domain of the Ancient God of the Azure Moon, unique rules prevailed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">Though she had not fully probed its limits yet, it was already clear that the Red Flower Avatar could not be completed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">‚ÄúThis is going to be an extremely hard-fought battle!‚Äù Mu Lan‚Äôs face was pale, her mood grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">On the Pig Hair Giant Wood Mountain:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">The Barbarian Demon Camp had likewise run into trouble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">A wave of boars stormed out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The swine crashed forward in a flood, emerging steadily from the sparse forest, slamming into the Barbarian Demon Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Trenches were filled in, ditches leveled, barriers and caltrops smashed by charging boars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Xu Dali had long since gone out to the battlefield, shouting a challenge to Ju Bing, the culprit behind the boar hordes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Ju Bing, alongside Gu Ya, was one of the two greatest beast tamers of the Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Gu Ya was adept at controlling wolves, while Ju Bing specialized in boars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="309">Facing Xu Dali‚Äôs insults, Ju Bing crossed his arms with a look of total indifference.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="311">In his view, it would be foolish for a beast tamer like him to engage in single combat with a physically powerful general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="313">Xu Dali soon found himself in dire straits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="315">As Ju Bing retreated, the boars continued to assault the camp, inflicting huge casualties on the Barbarian Demon Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="317">If the situation went on like this, it would lead to a crushing defeat and a disastrous rout for them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="319">This scene did not escape the notice of certain onlookers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="321">‚ÄúThat Xu Dali truly is a simple brute. He has a whole army, yet he‚Äôs hardly using them. He‚Äôs just borrowing a bit of strength and then fighting alone!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="323">‚ÄúAt this rate, the Barbarian Demon Camp will be breached by the boar herd soon, and they‚Äôll all fall to pieces.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="325">‚ÄúNot necessarily.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="327">‚ÄúYou‚Äôve forgotten something important.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="329">‚ÄúThe Barbarian Demon Camp took heavy losses and had to recruit fresh troops on a large scale. Most of these soldiers come from various barbarian tribes or demon cultivators. Due to their intelligence, customs, and other factors, they need extensive real training. Otherwise, they‚Äôre just cannon fodder in battle!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="331">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time for us to step in!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
