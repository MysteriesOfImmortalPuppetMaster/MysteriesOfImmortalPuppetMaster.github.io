<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The warmth in Ning Zhuo’s left arm lasted for a while before gradually disappearing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">“What exactly is this innate talent? I’ll have to find out in the future.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo put this matter aside for the time being and examined himself. He soon confirmed that his soul foundation had tripled in depth!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">This was an immense harvest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“Han Ming can still be used, this was only the first time.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The young man was looking forward to the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He went back to the prison cell and fed a medicinal pill to the unconscious Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Then, he entered the teleportation room again and returned to his underground workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He began reviewing the day’s events.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The risk he took had undoubtedly paid off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Han Ming had been captured, his soul foundation had tripled, and the matter of removing his name from the ranking was on the verge of success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Moreover, Ning Zhuo had also obtained a very valuable piece of information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">That was – Meng Chong had yet to finish dispersing his power!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This explained why Ning Zhuo was the only one on the ranking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Of course, he had also sacrificed a lot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong’s help didn’t come for free. He’d had to give up nearly half of his accumulated wealth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Before today, only 10% of the Foundation Establishment Pill in the Iron Will Gray Armor had remained. Now, 70% of that had been consumed, leaving only 3% of the total remaining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">In addition, his identity as Hanging-Hair Traveler could no longer be used. That disguise would definitely become a wanted criminal after today.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">“But it was all worth it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Even if the Iron Will Gray Armor became completely defunct and he had to use up all his wealth, Ning Zhuo wouldn’t hesitate in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo’s thoughts were clear. In this situation, preserving his life was more important than anything else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“The issue of the Foundation Establishment Pill is rather urgent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Should I buy one through Sun Lingtong? His black market connections would make it much easier for him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“It would be best if there were Foundation Establishment Pills among the rewards for clearing levels in the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“But so far, all the clear rewards have been related to mechanical arts.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo temporarily couldn’t come to a decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">This wasn’t a question of his trust in Sun Lingtong. Instead, it was because medicinal pills like Foundation Establishment pills were extremely important, and had always been strictly controlled by the various major factions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">A vast majority of cultivators lacked innate talents or special techniques. If they wanted to cultivate to the Foundation Establishment stage, they mostly had to rely on Foundation Establishment Pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The supply of Foundation Establishment Pills was in the hands of the major factions, allowing them to help their own disciples breakthrough and expand their scale of influence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The competition over Foundation Establishment Pills even spread to the medicinal ingredients market, and the main medicinal ingredients were all heavily regulated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Controlling the sales of these medicinal ingredients could limit the production of Foundation Establishment Pills in other factions, giving rise to indirect suppression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">And a faction’s own Foundation Establishment Pills could also be used to recruit outside talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">In general, Foundation Establishment Pills were all used up internally and rarely made it outside. Those circulating in the market were also clearly accounted for.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Foundation Establishment Pills were often headliner items for auctions, always the subject of fierce bidding wars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Very, very few Foundation Establishment Pills could be found in the black market. Even if there were some, they were mostly bait thrown out by certain factions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo had been gathering information for over ten years and had seen such things happen several times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“If my identity is exposed, the Foundation Establishment-level combat power of the Iron Will Gray Armor won’t help me at all. After all, I’ll be fighting Golden Core and Nascent Soul stage powerhouses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“Not to mention, there’s still the grand formation covering the immortal city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“I don’t need the Iron Will Gray Armor to explore the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“My identity as Hanging-Hair Traveler can’t be used anymore, either. For now, I don’t need the Iron Will Gray Armor for anything.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">After thinking about it, Ning Zhuo decided to postpone this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“I’m currently number one in the ranking!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Right now, Ning Zhuo felt both surprise and joy about this fact.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">During his exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace, he had always thought that he was the one playing catch-up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">He had been doing his best to avoid being left behind by Meng Chong and the others, never realizing that he was actually ahead of them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“No, calm down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"There's nothing to be proud of.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Meng Chong’s previous cultivation was too high, so it’s taking him a long time to disperse his power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Moreover, he suffered an attack, which delayed his progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“The same is true for Zhou Zhu, Zheng Jian, and the others.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Ning Zhuo analyzed things carefully. He felt that he was only able to rank first because of his advantage in information, his Buddha Heart Demon Seal’s ability to directly convert magical power, and finally his longstanding habit of hiding his true strength to avoid the attention of others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“These things all come from my mother.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“What do I myself have?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“I only have a low-grade innate talent. Even if I try my best, it’s only enough to be in the lead for a short time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Without the treasure seal, without the prior information, would I have been able to accomplish this?” Ning Zhuo shook his head internally.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Meng Chong and the others will soon catch up and surpass me.” His expression turned cautious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo admonished himself repeatedly and tried to adjust his mentality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“A person must be humble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Just look at Han Ming, who was so proud of her status as a demonic sect disciple. What’s happened to her now?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“This is a lesson written in blood! I must learn it well!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">After continuous self-rebukes, the little joy and pride Ning Zhuo had held previously soon disappeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Next, I have to wait for my soul to be drawn into the Lava Immortal Palace once again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo’s soul was currently in excellent condition, being three times stronger than his previous peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He was very much looking forward to his third entry into the palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">In the end, he waited and waited… all for nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Strange, what’s going on?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Last time, my soul was drawn in before it even fully recovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Why’s it so slow now?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo was surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Meanwhile, in the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was lying on the throne, its dragon head slightly raised and its eyes piercing space to observe Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Seeing Ning Zhuo’s expectant look, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit snorted, blowing two puffs of flame from its nostrils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Then, it closed its eyes and turned its head, no longer looking at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Fei Si personally escorted Meng Chong back to the City Lord Mansion. Seeing his young master put under heavy guard once again, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Soon afterward, one of his subordinates came to report and offered up a jade slip. Fei Si sent his divine sense into the jade slip and saw the results of the investigation on the Purple Sun Villa incident.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The mechanical constructs that the demonic cultivators left behind were all mass produced items and couldn’t provide any valuable clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">According to eyewitnesses and the traces at the scene, it could be concluded that there were three demonic cultivators participating in the attack. Two of them had exposed their faces, but the third one was very sneaky, disappearing without a trace after stealing all the pills in the storage room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Fei Si focused his attention on the two demonic cultivators whose faces were known.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The jade slip contained vivid portraits of two people. One was a cold-looking female cultivator – Han Ming. As for the other, it was an old man with a hunched back and a cane.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Han Ming… sigh.” Fei Si let out a breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Previously, Han Ming had sought trouble with Sun Lie, and even attacked him numerous times. Sun Lie had reported these incidents to the city guards, but after receiving subtle hints from Fei Si, these subordinates merely went through the motions for their investigation and didn’t really take things seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Why? Of course, it was because Han Ming was a disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect, a major faction of the demonic path!</paragraph><br/><br/>
