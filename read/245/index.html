<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 245: Gift from the Cloud Sea</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo and Song Fuli met once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Previously, they had finalized the business deal for the mechanical explosive monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo had instructed Chen Cha's side to work overtime, urgently producing a large number of mechanical explosive monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Now, it was time for the two to hand over the goods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"I didn't expect the situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City to deteriorate so rapidly, to the point of being besieged by demon beasts," Song Fuli lamented.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He had led the cloud merchants here, and just as business was about to flourish, the city was surrounded by demon beasts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Seeing Ning Zhuo again, he felt a deep sense of the unpredictability of fate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Little did he know, the true culprit behind the beast siege was right in front of him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo also sighed deeply, "Indeed, who would have thought that demon beasts would besiege Fire Persimmon Immortal City? However, the truly terrifying demon beast forces are still atop Fire Persimmon Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Therefore, this time, we cannot deliver the quantity we previously agreed upon. This is the first batch of mechanical explosive monkeys, and it will also be the last," Ning Zhuo said with a helpless sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">At the critical moment of life and death for Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the battle was ongoing, and Chen Cha, along with many other mechanical workshops, were strictly controlled by Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The production tasks of these workshops had to be changed to produce the most combat-effective mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Compared to classic combat constructs, the combat style of the mechanical explosive monkeys was rather ordinary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Originally, their combat method was solely self-detonation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Later, during a battle with Zhou Zeshen, Ning Zhuo added another mechanical componentâ€”a throwable firecracker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Even so, with only these two combat methods, the mechanical explosive monkeys were not truly suitable for the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Zhuo's design was more suited for harvesting fire persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Song Fuli nodded repeatedly in understanding, "I understand, I understand." He casually took a sample from the cargo box and began inspecting it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The half-human-tall mechanical explosive monkey appeared before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">At first glance, the mechanical explosive monkey was quite eye-catching, with its bright red fur and lifelike features.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Song Fuli was no ordinary person; his cultivation had reached the Golden Core Stage, allowing him to use his divine sense for inspection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">He immediately used his divine sense to scan the entire body of the mechanical explosive monkey from inside out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">A flash of brilliance appeared in Song Fuli's eyes as he commented, "The monkey's skin is made from Fire Continuation Rat skin, using the most traditional spirit embroidery sewing technique. The skeleton is made of Heavenly Gold, primarily for lightweight and spatial efficiency, making it convenient to arrange storage formations on it. However, to compress the formation and leave room for the monkey's future upgrades requires a high level of skill from the formation master, which isn't cheap."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Saying this, Song Fuli extended his hand and opened the clenched fists of the mechanical explosive monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He felt the fingers of the monkey with his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After a few breaths, he nodded slightly, "The micro formations here use an interlocking method, saving a lot of space. The monkey's fingers are agile and can perform very complex movements, which is the foundation for precise harvesting tasks. From this, it's clear, Young Master Ning Zhuo, that your foundation in formations is quite solid."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Considering you're only sixteen this year, your achievements in mechanical constructs are quite impressive." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"The wandering pellet in the monkey's brain should be your own creation, used as a receiver for divine sense to minimize costs. Personally, I would suggest replacing the wandering pellet with a formation disk to create an enhanced model. Although the wandering pellet design is unique, its precision control for Foundation Establishment cultivators is limited, far inferior to a proper formation disk. Moreover, switching to a formation disk could increase the price of each mechanical explosive monkey by at least thirty percent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Song Fuli's words made Ning Zhuo look at him in a new light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">He hadn't expected Song Fuli's expertise in mechanical constructs to be quite profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">However, upon reflection, Ning Zhuo understood: as a traveling merchant from the Flying Cloud Kingdom, leading a caravan, Song Fuli naturally had to be well-versed in various cultivation arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Otherwise, he would easily make mistakes when purchasing local specialties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Song Fuli continued, "The body of the mechanical explosive monkey seems to use alchemical techniques to create a composite material. Since it needs to harvest fire persimmons, the composite material is heavily stacked with fire resistance. Actually, I have a better method, which is Cold Cloud."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"This cloud, common in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, can be mixed into the main material, reducing the weight of the mechanical explosive monkey and further enhancing its fire resistance. Are you familiar with Cold Cloud?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly and admitted, "In the many mechanical manuals my mother left me, this material is recorded. Unfortunately, this isn't the Flying Cloud Kingdom, but Fire Persimmon Mountain. To acquire Cold Cloud, I would have to import it, making the cost much higher than the current composite material. From a manufacturing cost perspective, I decided to exclude Cold Cloud."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Song Fuli was slightly taken aback, then laughed heartily, "That's true. I know your mother was from the Flying Cloud Kingdom." At this point, Song Fuli looked at Ning Zhuo with a sincere expression, "I apologize, we secretly investigated many aspects of Young Master Ning Zhuo's background. In fact, this is a routine for us Cloud Merchants whenever we arrive at a new place. After all, we need to do business on others' turf. Therefore, we try to understand the important figures in the area as much as possible and visit them one by one."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, City Lord Meng Kui, Divine Constable Zhu Xuanji, and the Black Market Master Ning Zhuo are all key figures we focus on." Despite being a dignified Golden Core cultivator, Song Fuli spoke with a tone of flattery, a business attitude truly admirable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Song Fuli continued, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, you have half the bloodline of the Flying Cloud Kingdom, so the Flying Cloud Kingdom is also your home. I suggest you visit, especially the Myriad Clouds Sea, the sooner the better."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned, his eyes revealing a longing, "Indeed, the Myriad Clouds Sea... I've long heard of its fame and wish to see it for myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Song Fuli laughed, "It's not just about seeing it. For those outside the Flying Cloud Kingdom, the Myriad Clouds Sea is a natural wonder, a place providing abundant cultivation resources. But for us from the Flying Cloud Kingdom, it holds another layer of significance."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Any cultivator with the Flying Cloud Kingdom's bloodline, upon entering the Myriad Clouds Sea, can receive its gift! The simplest gift is a certain ability to sense the Flying Cloud Kingdom's bloodline. To be honest, the first time I saw you, I felt a sense of kinship, sensing your Flying Cloud bloodline, because I have been to the Myriad Clouds Sea. This is a skill possessed by every person from the Flying Cloud Kingdom who has visited the Myriad Clouds Seaâ€”to sense the bloodline of fellow countrymen."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">In the entire cultivation world, the Myriad Clouds Sea was renowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Even without his mother's legacy, Ning Zhuo could gather much information about the Myriad Clouds Sea from the Ning family's library.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">This super resource point was so famous it became common knowledge in the cultivation world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Fire Persimmon Mountain couldn't compare to it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Myriad Clouds Sea was a gathering place of the Dao of Clouds, containing extremely rich Dao principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">It nurtured a vast amount of cloud-related resources, attracting cultivators of the Transformation and Void Refinement stages to linger and comprehend the ultimate Dao of Clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Song Fuli took a deep breath and continued, "Suddenly urging you to visit the Flying Cloud Kingdom might seem abrupt. But in reality, how should I put it? The Myriad Clouds Sea is a spiritual home for every person from the Flying Cloud Kingdom. Have you heard of the legend of the Flying Cloud's return home?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo nodded, "I've heard of it. My mother told me about it when she was alive."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Song Fuli sighed softly, "Young Flying Clouds want to venture out, but after wandering for many years, they realize that their homeland is their origin, and no matter where they go, it belongs to them. To be honest, I was the same when I was young, wanting to explore the world and see all its wonders. But one day, when I arrived at the Myriad Clouds Sea and delved deep into it, I was moved to tears. The unparalleled shock and familiarity made me feel as if I had returned to my mother's embrace. The Myriad Clouds Sea gave me a feeling of awe and emotion that is hard to describe in words. Only when you personally enter the sea one day will you deeply feel it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo sighed, his tone uncertain, "Perhaps one day, I will go." He couldn't be sure if such a day would come.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">According to his life plan, he would seize the Lava Immortal Palace and become its master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">However, doing so would mean being confined to Fire Persimmon Mountain unless he activated the Lava Immortal Palace to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">But if he were the palace master, and the Lava Immortal Palace was responsible for suppressing Fire Persimmon Mountain, he obviously couldn't abandon his post. "Perhaps, I should indeed visit the Myriad Clouds Sea, but how should I go about it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">All along, the Lava Immortal Palace had been Ning Zhuo's life goal, and he had never considered other possibilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">His mind was filled with thoughts of the Lava Immortal Palace and his mother's dying wishes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">In fact, previously, Sun Lingtong had advised him: if he failed to seize the Lava Immortal Palace, or even if he succeeded, he should flee and join the Void Sect for some degree of protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Although Ning Zhuo inwardly acknowledged this as a fallback plan, he had never truly considered taking that path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">But now, Song Fuli's words made Ning Zhuo genuinely feel the possibility of another path in life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo's heart was touched.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
