<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 393: Hua Gui Evaluates the Wine.</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="2">"Fake wine?" Upon hearing Hua Gui's judgment, Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows. "Are you sure?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="4">Hua Gui patted her chest firmly, earnestly insisting: "Young Master, I am a Spirit Chef. Although I'm not skilled at making wine, spirit wine falls within my expertise."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="6">"The recipe for this wine is indeed quite contradictory, there's no mistaking it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="8">After a pause, Hua Gui continued: "I just tasted a sip and detected two main ingredients. One is Yellow Springs water, and the other is Night Wandering Grass."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="10">"Yellow Springs water can consolidate souls and stabilize spirits, commonly used in alchemy and talismans, but as a wine ingredient, the yin and cold energy is too great, directly harming the drinker's yang energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="12">"Night Wandering Grass grows in dark, damp places and can enhance spirit and soul power, but its nature is yin and heavy. Therefore, it's unsuitable for mortal cultivators, but rather suited for netherworld beings and ghost cultivators. Thus, it often serves as a resting place for night-wandering spirits."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="14">"Both Night Wandering Grass and Yellow Springs water are yin-cold substances. Their powers are extremely similar, unable to produce complementary effects, and instead tend to make the wine's nature one-dimensional, bringing yin-cold afflictions to cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="16">After discussing the main ingredients, Hua Gui moved on to the auxiliary materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="18">She took another small sip of the Netherworld Contemplation Wine, making several hand signs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="20">Shortly after, she looked at Ning Zhuo and asked: "Young Master Ning, I believe the auxiliary ingredients should include moon dew, netherworld jade, and fresh human tears, is that correct?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="22">Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, no longer concealing: "As far as I know, the first two are correct, but the last one isn't fresh human tears, but nine-tailed fox tears."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="24">Hua Gui swallowed and spoke solemnly: "Although moon dew has the effect of nourishing the spirit and mind, its nature is cool and is often used to balance other warmer ingredients in spirit food and pills. However, in the Netherworld Contemplation Wine, it purely enhances the cold properties, not only failing to harmonize but intensifying the overall wine's coldness, making its nature extreme."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="26">"Netherworld jade is a special product of the underworld, commonly used in crafting magical tools, with properties that are steady and yin, good for protecting and stabilizing souls. But as an auxiliary ingredient, it's too heavy and sluggish, hindering the wine's spiritual energy flow and preventing a light, crisp taste. Netherworld jade's strong absorption ability easily attracts other spiritual properties in the wine, making the body sink and lose its proper vitality and layered complexity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="28">"The last ingredient is nine-tailed fox tears. These tears are quite precious and have the effect of clearing distracting thoughts and purifying souls, but they work through emotions and often fluctuate greatly, making them hard to control. Compared to the previously mentioned yin-cold materials, although nine-tailed fox tears carry warm emotional properties, they cannot balance these overly cold main and auxiliary ingredients."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="30">"Because the amount used is too small. I couldn't even taste it just now! In this case, the nine-tailed fox tears are overly contaminated by the wine's cold nature, preventing their inherent effects from manifesting, being consumed by the wine body."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="32">After finishing, Hua Gui concluded: "So, in summary, the main ingredients in this wine recipe are too similar in nature, weakening the wine's variation and depth, leading to a rigid nature."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="34">"The auxiliary ingredients of moon dew and netherworld jade not only fail to balance the main ingredients but actually intensify the wine's cold and heavy qualities."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="36">"The only hopeful ingredient, nine-tailed fox tears, is used in too small an amount to balance the yin nature. Moreover, due to its emotional fluctuations and resonance, it clashes with the cold wine body, potentially causing huge emotional discrepancies. If drinkers aren't mentally stable, they might fall into soul-shaking turbulence, indirectly leading to extreme emotional changes or even loss of control."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="38">Hua Gui pondered: "If it were me, I would remove some main and auxiliary ingredients and use warm, yang materials to balance it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="40">"For example, Scorching Sun Fruit, Red Flame Spirit Mushroom, Purple Yang Lotus Seeds, and being even bolder, we could choose Phoenix Gold Thread."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="42">Hua Gui's attitude toward Ning Zhuo was different from others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="44">This explanation was completely heartfelt, without any falsehood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="46">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and asked her: "So can this wine allow one's thoughts to extend into the netherworld, to comprehend the wisdom of the ancestors and receive guidance from the beyond?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="48">Hua Gui's eyes widened as she smiled: "How could that be possible? Young Master, could you have been deceived?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="50">Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">He tasted the wine again, finding the flavor unchanged from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">Had Linghu Jiu deceived him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">Based on his understanding of Linghu Jiu's character, this made no sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Did Linghu Jiu give him fake wine? If he didn't want to give it, he could have simply said it was all gone, rather than sharing the last jar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Why go to such unnecessary trouble!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">Seeing Ning Zhuo silent, Hua Gui furrowed her brows in thought, wanting to help shoulder his burden, and voluntarily suggested: "Young Master, if you wish to communicate with the netherworld and receive guidance from ancestors, there are actually many methods."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">"The most orthodox and safest way is through grand ancestral ceremonies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">"Due to blood relations, netherworld spirits won't easily harm us. They will benefit from the ceremony, maintain rationality, and restore their humanity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">"Actually... the separation between the world of the living and dead is nature's arrangement, and it has its reasons."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">"The yin and cold of netherworld things is profound, even capable of distorting temperament, filled with hatred, resentment, and other negative emotions, to the point of jealousy and destructive desire toward the living world and vital things, wanting what they cannot have."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">"For us cultivators of the living world, we shouldn't have too much contact."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">"Otherwise, it can easily lead to many troubles."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">Hua Gui expressed genuine concern for Ning Zhuo's well-being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">However, Ning Zhuo wasn't listening carefully, instead pondering the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">Along with his investigation and Hua Gui's evaluation of the Netherworld Contemplation Wine, the whole matter became increasingly complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">"What is the truth?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">"Where did I sense something strange?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">"Is Hua Gui really wrong? She and Linghu Jiu are complete opposites..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">"No, or perhaps they're both right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">Ning Zhuo thought about these things, becoming somewhat absent-minded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">Hua Gui stood beside him, carefully observing his face, her heart racing: "Indeed! Even Young Master Ning's furrowed brow while thinking is so dignified!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">"I really want to hold his head to my chest and give it a good rub."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">Hua Gui's emotions were so intense that Ning Zhuo quickly sensed them through the Life Hanging Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">Ning Zhuo: ......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">He hurriedly asked Hua Gui to leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">"I was driven away, Young Master Ning drove me away!" After leaving Ning Zhuo's cave dwelling, Hua Gui was so upset her eyes grew misty and her face flushed red.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Ning Zhuo returned to his cave dwelling but stopped pondering.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">"With so much fog right now, better wait for the results of further discussions with the ancestors before making any judgments."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">The spirit plant cabin in the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was now empty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">The Spirit Concealing Willow had been taken away by Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">This made Ning Zhuo feel empty inside and quite uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">Soon after, Ning Jiufan found him again to inform him of the progress of further negotiations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">The good news was that after Lin Bufan personally examined it, he had accepted the Spirit Concealing Willow and indicated he could treat it properly, though it would require considerable effort—</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">It would take a lot of time and many resources to gradually heal it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">The resources mentioned here mostly involved Nascent level materials. So much so that Ning Jiufan immediately used his Earth Killing Fire as a deposit, paying it to Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">The bad news was that the Netherworld Contemplation Wine’s recipe was non-negotiable and forbidden from being sold outside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">After discussing with Ning Zhuo and discovering that drinking more Netherworld Contemplation Wine had no effect, Ning Jiufan advised: "Given the current severe negotiation situation, we might as well set aside the Netherworld Contemplation Wine and focus on the Spirit Concealing Willow first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">"Master Lin Bufan seems to want to participate in the Spirit Concealing Willow project. He wants to secure several usage slots for the sect's promising cultivators. Of course, this all depends on successfully healing the Spirit Concealing Willow first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">"I think this is completely acceptable! But of course, it depends on your opinion, since the Spirit Concealing Willow was given to you by the Mountain God of Cloud Concealment Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">This was Ning Jiufan's suggestion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">His meaning was simple, mainly two points.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">First, agreeing to such cooperation could greatly reduce the pressure on the Ning clan regarding payment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Second: Providing several usage slots to the Myriad Medicine Sect could also extend and deepen the cooperation between both parties, making their relationship more solid, resilient, and lasting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">Ning Zhuo nodded, expressing agreement with Ning Jiufan's opinion and immediately adopting it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">At the same time, he also told Ning Jiufan about Hua Gui's evaluation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">This also made Ning Jiufan feel puzzled and strange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">After the Ning family grandfather and grandson speculated together, they still made no progress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">"The Netherworld Contemplation Wine has become a minor detail, thinking more about it is useless, better focus on the main points. What do you think?" Ning Jiufan finally said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Ning Zhuo sighed and nodded helplessly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">He pretended to agree, but his heart couldn't let it go.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">This sense of strangeness grew stronger, gradually developing into a strong intuition—the Netherworld Contemplation Wine was a flaw he had accidentally uncovered. The truth buried within might be quite shocking!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">That night, Ning Zhuo tossed and turned, unable to sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">By dawn, he solemnly instructed Sun Lingtong: "Big Brother, there's a very important letter that needs you to deliver personally!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">He had Sun Lingtong quietly pilot the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, first moving far from the Myriad Medicine Sect, deliberately leaving their sphere of influence, then sending this letter to the capital through South Bean Kingdom's postal stations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">Yes, this letter was still for Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">One can imagine that Zhu Xuanji would be quite surprised to receive this letter. He wouldn't have expected Ning Zhuo to send him a second letter so quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">But in fact, even Ning Zhuo himself hadn't expected to write to Zhu Xuanji again so soon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">After Sun Lingtong secretly piloted the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon back, and Ning Zhuo confirmed it, he took the National Longing Wine and went to visit the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">"Brother Linghu, I've come again!" Ning Zhuo carried the wine jar, in high spirits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
