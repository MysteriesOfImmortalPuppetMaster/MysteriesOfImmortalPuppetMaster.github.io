<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Lady, things have taken a turn for the worse!" A cultivator hurried to Ban Jie, delivering a flying messenger talisman before whispering his report.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">As Ban Jie listened, her divine sense scanned the talisman. Her brow furrowed deeply. "What? Ning Zhuo has found Ban Ji again and is participating in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"Damn it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"How did he figure it out?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ban Jie's expression turned grave, and she sighed inwardly. "Is this the power of a Human Tribulation? I've done my best to spread misinformation and was confident we hadn't leaked any intelligence. Yet Ning Zhuo still managed to pinpoint Ban Ji with such precision."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"No, now's not the time to dwell on that."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ban Jie shook her head slightly, rapidly analyzing the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">The flying messenger talisman detailed Ban Ji, Ning Zhuo, and the others' performances in the second trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Seeing that Ban Ji hadn't obtained even a single sword or blade in his initial attempts, Ban Jie immediately understood the reason.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Ning Zhuo is Ban Ji's Human Tribulation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"His mere presence, let alone his actions, will disrupt Ban Ji's Luck."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"If Ning Zhuo hadn't intervened and participated in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial of the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor, Ban Ji would likely have encountered a sword or blade in the first or second round."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"But Ning Zhuo's presence and participation have severely suppressed Ban Ji's Luck, causing him considerable misfortune."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The Ban Clan had long prepared for Ban Ji's participation in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, devising a meticulously planned strategy. Yet now, he hadn't even seen a single sword or blade - a situation so rare as to be almost unheard of.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Fortunately, Ban Jie had been dispatched by the Ban Clan to handle unexpected contingencies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"We can't allow Ban Ji to be defeated by Ning Zhuo in such a public setting!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"If that happens, the entire Ban Clan's reputation will suffer, and we'll be seen as inferior."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"More importantly, Qi Luck is at stake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"Human Tribulations naturally suppress cultivators undergoing Tribulation Transcendence, but that doesn't mean cultivators are powerless to resist."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"This competition is the perfect opportunity for a counterattack."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Success here would greatly boost Ban Ji's Luck, shifting the momentum in his favor. With enough successful counterattacks, Ban Ji's Luck might even overwhelm his Human Tribulation!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ban Jie understood the crucial point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The reputation of the Righteous Path was secondary; what truly mattered was Ban Ji's Luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ban Ji's Luck needed to continuously rise, higher and higher, until it reached a critical threshold and triggered a qualitative transformation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Reaching this point would open up boundless possibilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The Royal Mandate would officially manifest, granting both Ban Ji and the Ban Clan entirely new beginnings and privileges.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<hr class="subtle-line" index="53"/>
<paragraph index="54">Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">Ning Zhuo tapped the Bronze Blade against the Bronze Sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">"Sword in the right hand, blade in the left?" His mind continued to wander along the path of his recent inspiration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">Swords and blades were the most common weapons, so many of the Demonic Cultivator souls Ning Zhuo had absorbed contained extensive experience in their use.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">This knowledge had been digested and internalized during his previous two real-world battles, becoming an integral part of his own skill set.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">The practical combat experience had left a profound impression on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">"The Bronze Blade and Sword each possess innate techniques, which is both a blessing and a limitation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">"To create a combined sword-and-blade style, I must build upon this foundation rather than inventing something entirely new."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">"The Bronze Sword only has basic sword techniques, while the Bronze Blade includes combo attacks and small routines. Therefore, to develop a combined style, the Bronze Blade must take the lead, with the Bronze Sword serving as support."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">Ning Zhuo immediately found his direction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">He took a deep breath, his left hand forming a loose fist as he grasped the Bronze Blade, while his right hand gripped the Bronze Sword tightly. Slowly, he assumed his stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">Guided by his thoughts, his hands began to move, the Bronze Blade and Bronze Sword dancing in continuous practice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">This strange scene drew the attention of many onlookers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">"Look, what's Ning Zhuo doing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">"He's already refined the Bronze Blade, and his physical injuries have almost healed. Why isn't he rushing to the next battle?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">"It looks like he's... creating new techniques?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">The crowd exchanged bewildered glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">One person rubbed their forehead. "This is the Rising Cloud Minor Trial of our Ninefold Profound Armament Armor! I've never seen anyone conceive new techniques during the trials before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">"Hmph! Ning Zhuo spent all his time learning in actual combat, and now he's completely forgotten about the trials to create new techniques. He clearly doesn't take our Profound Armor Cave seriously!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">"He's a top-tier genius, arrogant and proud. That's to be expected."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">Some began to resent Ning Zhuo, feeling he was disrespecting the Rising Cloud Minor Trial and, by extension, the Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">"I can't wait to see the look on Ning Zhuo's face when he's finally defeated and eliminated. Serves him right for wasting precious time here!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">"Hmph, he seems to be trying to create a combined technique. As if something like that can be designed in a day or two!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">"Indeed, he's being rather presumptuous..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">Ning Zhuo, also attempting to devise a technique, was beginning to grasp the difficulty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">Sword and saber techniques shared fundamental principles in power generation and application, yet they also possessed distinct differences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">To wield both simultaneously and achieve a combat effectiveness greater than either weapon alone required a profound understanding of both sword and saber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">In other words, it demanded a martial realm of that caliber!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">Ning Zhuo, of course, did not possess such mastery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Had it been a matter of Five Elements Spells, his current realm would have allowed him to spontaneously create spells on the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">"But I have other means.", Ning Zhuo thought, secretly activating Life Hanging by a Thread to communicate with his closest ally. Eldest Brother, lend me your aid!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">Sun Lingtong, far away at the Jade Cleansing Pavilion, had long anticipated Ning Zhuo's participation in the Ninefold Profound Armament Armor's minor trial and had already prepared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">Activating his Innate Talent, Sun Lingtong peered into the Luo Shu, channeling beneficial influences from the Dao Artifact to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">Simultaneously, Sun Lingtong, a master of both sword and saber, especially saber techniques, received Ning Zhuo's situation through Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">As Ning Zhuo practiced his movements, Sun Lingtong secretly discussed and helped refine his ideas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">On the surface, Ning Zhuo appeared to be struggling alone, but in reality, he had the assistance of Sun Lingtong, whose comprehension far surpassed his own, and the support of a Dao Artifact!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">Before long, they had devised a new technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Ning Zhuo wielded the Bronze Blade in his left hand, unleashing the Wave-Breaking Triple Strike. The blade surged forward, his body sinking low as he channeled power from his waist into a downward slash against an imaginary enemy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">Simultaneously, his right hand followed with the Bronze Sword, executing the Point Thrust - the swiftest and most precise sword technique - at the precise moment when the blade's momentum waned, between the waning of the old force and the emergence of the new.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">The swift and accurate thrust of the sword compensated for the inherent weaknesses in the Wave-Breaking Triple Strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">The blade emphasized power, while the sword prioritized speed. With the blade as the primary force and the sword as support, the Wave-Breaking Triple Strike combo became even more seamless and refined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">"Hmm?" The observing cultivators revealed expressions of surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">"He's already made progress so quickly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">"Using the blade's combo as the foundation and the sword for support - that's the right approach."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">"If it were me, I could do it too. It's not particularly difficult; it's just merging two basic techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">"Could you do that when you were Ning Zhuo's age?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">"Uh..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">Ning Zhuo continued his demonstration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">He exerted force through his left arm, his wrist twisting nimbly to guide the Bronze Blade. Instead of relying on brute force, he engaged in a relentless, flowing combat style.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">The blade often skimmed the ground, targeting his opponent's lower body to restrict movement and create chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">Suddenly, the Bronze Sword in Ning Zhuo's right hand slashed down like an enraged dragon erupting from the sea. The sword's icy glint sent a chill through the observers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">"Hmm?!" Several cultivators who had been watching Ning Zhuo closely exchanged astonished glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">Some blinked repeatedly, hesitant to believe what they had just witnessed, convinced they must have misseen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">But after executing the strike, Ning Zhuo remained motionless for three breaths before repeating the technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">By the second repetition, the cultivators were certain: Ning Zhuo had created a new combined blade technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">"This time, he's no longer prioritizing the blade. The blade serves as support and setup, while the true killing intent lies in the sword!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">"He's wielding the blade like a sword and slashing with the sword like a blade. I must admit, that's quite innovative."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">"He seems to be searching for common ground between the saber and the sword. This technique alone shows that his understanding of both weapons has reached a new level!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">"Truly remarkable. He stopped to create a new technique, and he actually succeeded."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">The cultivators' admiration for Ning Zhuo soared once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong's discussion grew increasingly heated, both completely immersed in the creation of new techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">"Wait, Little Zhuo, what did you just say?" Sun Lingtong suddenly felt a flash of inspiration, but it slipped through his fingers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">Ning Zhuo looked puzzled. "Which part? I've said so much just now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">He promptly repeated his previous statements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">Sun Lingtong shook his head repeatedly. "Not that one, ah, not that one either..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">"Never mind, never mind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Knowing that such moments of spiritual insight were rare and fleeting, Sun Lingtong quickly retrieved a wooden awl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">Thunk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">He plunged the awl deep into the inner side of his thigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">Confucian Technique: Thigh-Piercing Awl!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">Ning Zhuo had taught this technique to Sun Lingtong long ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Instantly, the thoughts in Sun Lingtong's divine sea gained piercing clarity, shattering the illusions and allowing him to grasp the elusive spiritual light with precision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">He leaped with joy, shouting, "Little Zhuo, I've got another idea!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">Ning Zhuo listened intently, his face lighting up with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">He began practicing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">With his right arm, he thrust his sword forward in a swift, piercing strike. The blade moved like a shuttle, its tip flashing with a cold, metallic glint as it aimed straight for the center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">This sword technique was called Parting Waters.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">Upon striking an enemy, this technique would inevitably subject Ning Zhuo to a recoil force.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">In the next step, Ning Zhuo's left arm simulated this recoil force, channeling it into a sweeping arc with his Bronze Blade, rising in a perfect curve from below.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">This was the blade technique Moonrise Slash!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">Sun Lingtong was thrilled. "Little Zhuo, you've executed it perfectly! The brilliance of this combined attack lies in harnessing the enemy's own force as momentum for your blade strike."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">"This requires exceptional mastery of force transmission, body coordination, and timing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">"Your body must prepare in advance, anticipating the recoil force before it even arrives - it's a form of precognition..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">Sun Lingtong continued explaining enthusiastically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed with admiration. "Boss, you're incredible! How did you even think of such a technique?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">"Even if the blade strike is blocked, the recoil force will still drive the sword attack forward!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">"So, Parting Waters and Moonrise Slash can amplify each other, creating a continuous chain of attacks that cycles endlessly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Ning Zhuo sincerely admired Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">Sun Lingtong burst into hearty laughter, striking a triumphant pose with his hands on his hips in the Jade Cleansing Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">He reminded Ning Zhuo, "Little Zhuo, I think we've done enough for now. Call me if you need anything else."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="234">They had just co-created three new techniques, temporarily named: Wave-Breaking Star-Piercing Stance, Silk-Entangling Mountain-Crushing Stance, and the final Parting Waters Moonrise Slash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="236">Sun Lingtong knew these three techniques would keep Ning Zhuo busy practicing for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="238">Ning Zhuo understood this as well, so he temporarily severed the connection and began practicing with focused concentration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="240">The surrounding cultivators watched in speechless bewilderment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="242">"He's still practicing?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="244">"While others have already obtained their fourth Bronze Artifact, he's still stuck here, struggling with the basics."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="246">"The first two stances looked decent, but what's that third one? Stumbling and awkward - it's clearly not even fully developed yet!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="248">None of the cultivators recognized the essence of Parting Waters Moonrise Slash. This technique relied on leveraging the opponent's counterforce. Practicing alone against imaginary enemies, Ning Zhuo's blade and sword found no real resistance, resulting in clumsy movements that looked utterly unnatural.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="250">Ning Zhuo practiced for a while before setting off again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="252">"Using a blade in my left hand and a sword in my right hand doubles my attack speed, effectively doubling my combat power!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="254">"The coordination between blade and sword techniques requires practice. My footwork and power generation methods also need adjustments."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="256">"The three combined blade-sword techniques I developed with the boss are decent, but they can't compare to Ban Ji's blade-sword fusion techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="258">"He's honed his blade and sword skills for years, refining his combined techniques through countless real battles. They might even be the culmination of generations of refinement by countless predecessors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="260">"Even if I can't match him, understanding the intricacies of blade-sword fusion will give me an edge in our upcoming clash, allowing me to fully obstruct him!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="262">Ning Zhuo pondered these thoughts as he continued forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="264">Soon, he came across a pair of floating Bronze Gauntlets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="266">The young man's eyes lit up with delight!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="268">"What excellent weapons!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="270">"Fists and feet are more commonly used than blades and swords. Even those Method cultivators who don't use weapons like blades or swords have some proficiency in hand-to-hand combat, thanks to the life experiences I absorbed from the Demonic Cultivators."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="272">"In hand-to-hand combat, my 'foundation' is even deeper."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="274">"Moreover, using both fists and wielding both swords simultaneously share many similarities, making them highly valuable for cross-referencing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="276">"I need to study this thoroughly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="278">Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed with excitement as he eagerly approached the Bronze Gauntlets, a sword in his left hand and a blade in his right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="280">Meanwhile, a clandestine plot was unfolding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">"Lord Hao, someone over there is willing to double the price for your assistance," a cultivator transmitted through divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="284">Cultivator Hao, one of the deputy commanders of Profound Armor Cave, was currently overseeing the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="286">"Over there? Heh, isn't that the Ban Clan? They complained about my price being too high before. What changed their minds?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="288">"Never mind that. It's not important."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="290">"Suddenly doubling the price... what do they want me to do?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="292">"Let's be clear upfront: I won't do anything too outrageous."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="294">The cultivator quickly assured him, "Of course. They want you to subtly move the Bronze Blade and Bronze Sword to Ban Ji's path."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="296">"Additionally, they want you to create extra obstacles for Ning Zhuo. You have full discretion on how to implement these."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="298">Cultivator Hao sneered, sending a mental message with his divine sense: "Heh, still claiming it's not the Ban Clan?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="300">"They want me to secretly assist Ban Ji while simultaneously sabotaging Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="302">"Double the reward seems reasonable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="304">"Let me first assess the situation in the arena."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
