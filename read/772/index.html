<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo's flying letter flew straight into the cave abode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Old Chef opened the letter and read it, a look of pleasant surprise immediately appearing on his face. He muttered to himself, "I didn't expect the Young Master to actually take first place in the Profound Armor Cave minor trial!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Regarding this operation, Ning Zhuo had explained beforehand, stating the expectation - he only wanted to intercept Ban Ji, and didn't have high expectations for the results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Now, however, the result far exceeded expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Old Chef brought the flying letter to Qing Chi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Qing Chi was in the internal space of the martial arts formation, sparring with Snow-Colored Maiden Hui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The two sides fought back and forth, evenly matched.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Upon learning of Ning Zhuo's flying letter, Qing Chi immediately abandoned the sparring. After reading the letter, she wasn't surprised at all: "Young Master Ning Zhuo is a genius; naturally, one cannot use common sense to think of him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"He said 'only to intercept Ban Ji', but I knew long ago, this is his excellent quality of being modest!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Qing Chi was full of goodwill towards Ning Zhuo; her confidence in him was even more sufficient than Old Chef's, or even Ning Zhuo's own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Snow-Colored Maiden Hui stood nearby and gave a soft, cold snort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Old Chef chuckled: "Give me the letter, I'll go notify Gongsun Yan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Qing Chi, however, put the flying letter away, keeping it close to her body: "The news that the Young Master won and will stay in Profound Armor Cave for a few days, Old Chef, you just tell Gongsun Yan directly. No need to use this letter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Besides, he is selecting materials to make a divine statue. This is the task the Young Master assigned him; let him be busy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Old Chef naturally saw through Qing Chi's little thoughts. He didn't expose them, nodded, and left, the smile on his face growing a bit more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The "Rising Clouds Minor Trial" in Profound Armor Cave settled to dust. Information regarding this trial began to spread following Ning Zhuo's letter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Deep in Shuji Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo continued to accept the infusion of True Meaning and the blessing of Principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Things he once regarded as standards were broken one after another, then reorganized, revealing multiple optimized directions in Ning Zhuo's Spirit Sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">How to neutralize certain extreme material properties, how to harmonize and guide the attributes of the vessel embryo, what methods to use to pursue extreme sharpness, how material flaws can become advantages - turning the rotten into the miraculous.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"The logic of artifacts is cyclical!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"The foundation of spirit endowment is determined at the very beginning of refining."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"How the spiritual energy flow inside the artifact can be more stable and efficient..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Renowned Master level Artifact Refining realm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo successfully leaped into it. To this point, previous standards were crushed and reorganized along with Ning Zhuo's will. To achieve a certain standard of refining, there are too many paths to choose from.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Amidst these various choices, Ning Zhuo's own aesthetics and values were embodied, causing every artifact he refined personally to begin bearing his personal style.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The irrigation of True Meaning came to an abrupt halt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A few breaths later, the addition of principles also stopped.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo opened his eyes and looked doubtfully at Qing Wu Langjun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Qing Wu Langjun had a look of joy and nodded slightly at him: "That's it. I have passed on all my True Meaning and Principles regarding Artifact Refining to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He subconsciously moved his body, feeling an unprecedented lightness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The burden was reduced by thirty percent; he suddenly felt space to advance in the other three paths. This was a wonderful feeling he didn't have before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">A gleam of disappointment flashed in the depths of Ning Zhuo's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">This was much less than he imagined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Only Renowned Master level Artifact Refining realm, and that's it?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Thinking carefully, this is normal."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"The Five Elements God Lord was on a much higher level than Qing Wu Langjun. Back then, He even attracted Divine Retribution because of his own cultivation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"His attainments in the Five Elements once compared to Heaven and Earth. With him imparting the Five Elements True Meaning, it naturally could make my Five Elements realm change heaven and earth!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Having experienced more, Ning Zhuo increasingly realized the immense value of the opportunity he gained at the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"Compared to the Five Elements God Lord, Qing Wu Langjun transformed from an Artifact Spirit to a Deity; all his foundation was accumulated passively."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"If He wants to go further, He needs to purify one path and cultivate it deeply."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Thoughts rose and fell in Ning Zhuo's Spirit Sea, feeling that Qing Wu Langjun choosing the Martial Path was quite correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He participated in Profound Armor Cave's Rising Clouds Minor Trial and personally used the Profound Weapon Armor, gaining deep insights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The Profound Weapon Armor possesses cultivation technologies of both Mechanisms and Artifact Refining. It was developed to deal with great wars, thus it also contains Military Strategy profundities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">A cultivator using multiple Profound Weapon Armors can form a battle formation; this is the embodiment of the Military Strategist school.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Shou Zhuo Wheel Slash Formation created by Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong was, in fact, the correct usage of the Profound Weapon Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">But compared to these three aspects, the true greatest value of the Profound Weapon Armor is the Martial Path!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">They undergo a qualitative change because of the Martial Path contained within. A Profound Weapon Armor containing a profound Martial Path can rival Golden Core combat power, Nascent Soul combat power, or even higher!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Letting the Profound Weapon Armor fight on its own, although less agile than a cultivator, is more reliable and practical from another angle."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Profound Weapon Armors won't have as many thoughts as cultivators, nor will they make choices to defect in battle. So they are more reliable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Rules between countries require Nascent Soul cultivators to publicly report their movements. But a Profound Weapon Armor rivaling Nascent Soul combat power can freely enter and exit various national borders. This is one embodiment of being more practical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">A question couldn't help but surface in Ning Zhuo's heart: "In Profound Armor Cave, exactly how many Profound Weapon Armors possess Nascent Soul level combat power?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Undoubtedly, this was a key number that largely determines this faction's voice within the Myriad Manifestations Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"Conversely, one can infer the number of Profound Weapon Armors from Profound Armor Cave's status in the Myriad Manifestations Sect's main mountain gate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"The faction of Profound Armor Cave is a self-contained sect within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, with sufficient foundation, possessing a calmness and composure to watch the changing winds and clouds."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Realistically, there should be at least three Nascent Soul level Profound Weapon Armors in Profound Armor Cave. Do they have Soul Formation level combat power Profound Weapon Armors?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo shook his head secretly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">This possibility was very low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The significance of a Soul Formation level is very major, not something the Nascent Soul level can compare to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"This opportunity is not small!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Even if the next two paths don't improve much, just the force of Profound Armor Cave itself has enough value for me to maintain a good relationship."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Thinking of this, Ning Zhuo took the opportunity during the break to thank Qing Wu Langjun.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Qing Wu Langjun nodded slightly. Superficially saying this was for his own Dao path, but inwardly feeling: This junior Ning Zhuo is indeed from a great clan; he knows the way, understands the rules, and knows gratitude. It is undoubtedly lucky for me to meet him. He surely has a great future. With this cooperative relationship, and him joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect, it is necessary for me to keep close contact with him in the future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After resting, Qing Wu Langjun started again: "Little friend Ning Zhuo, next is the Military Path, receive it well!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo looked solemn, his confidence a bit higher than before: "Please make your move, Langjun!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">In an instant, Ning Zhuo felt like he was thrown into an Asura battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Bloody, chaotic, deafening shouts of killing, blinding flashes of swords, flying severed limbs, the aura of death pressing on every inch of his nerves like a solid substance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">His vision blurred, countless scenes flashing by.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Infantry, cavalry, archers, scouts... countless troop types flew past his eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Square formations, circular formations, wedge formations... various formations flashed like lightning and thunder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Flags, drum beats, provisions, water sources, camps... various concepts came flooding in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Besides True Meaning, there were Principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Principles adding to his body made Ning Zhuo feel like he was sliced by blades, pierced by arrows, and crashed into by warhorses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He felt illusory exhaustion, as if he had experienced an extremely tragic bloody battle, his muscles sore and soft, even spasming and twitching from hacking and killing too many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo's face was pale, his whole body trembling, sweating hot sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">When this round ended, the sounds of killing, wailing, and clashing metal still lingered in his ears. Strong feelings of vomiting and dizziness impacted his mental defenses like a tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The second round was much more uncomfortable than the first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">After Ning Zhuo calmed his breathing slightly, he felt heartfelt joy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">His Military Path realm reached the peak of Apprentice!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he rarely dabbled in this aspect. The Battle of Thousand Peaks Forest made him make up for it significantly, but even after the battle of White Paper Immortal City, his realm in the Military Path was still only Apprentice level.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">He had also tried hard to study military manuals, but while Qing Chi comprehended them, Ning Zhuo didn't gain much.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The battle formation he realized relying on "Ancient Shared - Battle Armor" and Gao Sheng's Lost Writings, he still hadn't completely mastered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"My talent in the Military Path seems not to be outstanding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Perhaps because of this, bearing the True Meaning and Principles of the Military Strategist is harder than before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">When Ning Zhuo was thinking deeply, his face regained its rosiness, his breathing returned to normal, and his mental fatigue received visible relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Qing Wu Langjun had been observing carefully. Seeing this scene, he was very happy and appreciated Ning Zhuo even more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Even Sun Lingtong, who was secretly observing Ning Zhuo's condition via Life Hanging by a Thread, felt surprised and said in his heart: "Little Zhuo's body has great peculiarities, actually able to bear so many foreign principles without suffering disaster."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"I have never discovered this point before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"Is it related to that mysterious innate talent of his?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Qing Wu Langjun continued the True Meaning infusion and Principle blessing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">It was still the Military Path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo felt he was on the battlefield again. But this time, his nervousness reduced a lot, and the chaotic battlefield scenes became orderly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Battles played out in his heart: scout reconnaissance, analyzing enemy situations, designing tactics, choosing formations, commanding combat, battlefield adjustments, post-war inventory...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Arrowhead formation is good for breakthroughs, Crane Wing formation excels at outflanking, terrain advantages and disadvantages have huge influence... various insights flooded Ning Zhuo's heart like a rising tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The Military Strategist realm thus easily broke through the Apprentice level, reaching the Artisan realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">While Ning Zhuo was wantonly collecting True Meaning and Principles, intelligence about him had also spread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">-----</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Demon Subjugation Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Zhong Dao was buried in handling affairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">On the corner of his desk, among the piled-up jade slips, there was an intelligence jade slip recording information about Ning Zhuo and others.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Commerce Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Cao Gui thought about the intelligence he just learned and sighed softly: "Ning Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Previously, after Ning Zhuo revealed his reputation as a genius, friends in the clan suggested he contact Ning Zhuo again to establish a connection as capital for advancement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Cao Gui knew well that behind the friends were instructions from higher-ups.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"This time, Ning Zhuo defeated Ban Ji and even took first place. I'm afraid it will trigger the clan's higher-ups to personally come and lobby me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Green Bamboo Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Qing Huangzi placed the intelligence jade slip beside him, laughed aloud, drank a sip of tea, stood up, and walked out of the bamboo building.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He entered the depths of the bamboo forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Not long after, sounds of a flute came from the bamboo forest, melodious and pleasant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Autumn Pear Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Congratulations to Young Master Pi on moving to a new residence!" At the banquet, many cultivators surrounded Pi Fujie to congratulate him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Pi Fujie laughed heartily, raising his wine cup: "Come, drink up, drink up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">A flying letter arrived in his hand at this moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">He swept it with his divine sense, his heart skipping a beat: "Ning Zhuo..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">The joyful look immediately restrained a lot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"This kid really took action to intercept Ban Ji. He even took first place in Profound Armor Cave, defeating Ban Ji again!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"This time is different from the one at Green Bamboo Peak."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Let them fight each other, as long as it has nothing to do with me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Pi Fujie secretly rejoiced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Originally, he provoked Ning Zhuo but diverted the trouble to Ban Ji. He thought Ban Ji could teach Ning Zhuo a lesson. The reality was the opposite; Ning Zhuo had taught Ban Ji a lesson twice now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">This wasn't just different from his plan; it was completely opposite!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Martial Arts Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Two groups of people confronted each other, the atmosphere tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Yan Linglong whispered to Situ Xing, informing him of the new methods revealed by Situ Xing's opponent for this martial arts performance - Zhu Fenxiang - recently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The duel between the two officially started today!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Both sides engaged in intense intelligence warfare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Shen Xi suddenly received a flying letter. He unfolded it, eyebrows raising slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">This expression caught Situ Xing's attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Situ Xing: "Is there any latest intelligence regarding Zhu Fenxiang?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Shen Xi shook his head: "It's not about Zhu Fenxiang."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Coincidentally, Yan Linglong also received a flying letter. After reading it, she looked at Shen Xi, eyes flickering, expression subtle: "I suppose Young Master Shen's letter should be intelligence regarding Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Shen Xi immediately said 'not good' in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Situ Xing's heart moved: "Oh?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Yan Linglong handed the letter to Situ Xing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">A cold glint flashed in Situ Xing's eyes: "Ning Zhuo eliminated Ban Ji in the Profound Armor Cave minor trial? And took first place!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">"This person... is indeed outstanding."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"Hmph! Wait for me to defeat Zhu Fenxiang first, then suppress this person, completely controlling the situation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Finishing these words, Situ Xing tossed the letter, held his head high, and strode into the martial arts arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">On the other side, a female cultivator also walked out, equally full of fighting spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Commerce Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Che Zhuzi came here every few days to inspect the market and facilitate pricing for his spider silk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">At the same time, he listened for other intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">"Ning Zhuo eliminated Ban Ji in Profound Armor Cave?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">"This kid's comprehension is a bit excessively strong, isn't it? Indeed a genius!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"Profound Armor Cave..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">Che Zhuzi's face darkened, a heavy scene from deep in his memory surfacing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">He was invited to Mystic Master Dunjia's residence, finding his good friend on his deathbed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Che Zhuzi was pale with fright, hurriedly trying to save him, but to no avail.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">He asked his friend, why fall to this state?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Mystic Master Dunjia said: "I was forced by Profound Armor Cave to perform a divination, paying the price of my lifespan. You are my only good friend; I called you here to entrust my legacy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Che Zhuzi exclaimed "Ah", filled with resentment towards Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">Mystic Master Dunjia: "I have hidden all my legacy inside a tortoise shell. I trouble you, old friend, to cremate my body after I die, and keep this tortoise shell for a destined person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">Che Zhuzi held Mystic Master Dunjia's hand, eyes red: "Old friend, I will certainly carry out your dying request. But who is your destined successor? I don't know how to distinguish."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="307">Mystic Master Dunjia smiled faintly: "I have already calculated it. You leave the tortoise shell in the storage. Do not move it. One day, it will be stolen. That person is the successor I place my hopes on."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
