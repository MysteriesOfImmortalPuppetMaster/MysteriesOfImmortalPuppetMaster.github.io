<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
“Boss!” Ning Zhuo was shocked and threw himself over to Sun Lingtong’s side.<br/>
<br/>
He hastily cast a spell to check Sun Lingtong’s condition.<br/>
<br/>
Very soon, Ning Zhuo’s brows knitted, and his expression became anxious.<br/>
<br/>
Countless fine cracks gradually appeared on the surface of Sun Lingtong’s body. These cracks crisscrossed all over Sun Lingtong, and traces of starlight flickered within them.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately used healing spells to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
He then took out a large amount of pills and poured them into Sun Lingtong’s mouth. At the same time, he channeled his spiritual energy into Sun Lingtong, helping him immediately circulate the medicinal power throughout his entire body.<br/>
<br/>
Still ineffective!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was so anxious that sweat beaded on his forehead, and his face turned pale.<br/>
<br/>
Even though his five-element realm was profound, he felt powerless when confronted with the void!<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, Boss!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo began using all sorts of methods, such as the Life-Hanging-by-a-Thread Technique, the Stone-Forged Earth-Treasure Divine Ability, and so on, all to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s body trembled as he watched the cracks over Sun Lingtong’s entire body grow larger and larger.<br/>
<br/>
He gasped for breath, drenched in sweat, seeing Sun Lingtong unconscious and on the brink of death. He was no longer calm as before!<br/>
<br/>
“Boss… Boss…”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continuously took out everything he had from his storage belt, trying frantically.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, his movements stopped, and his bloodshot eyes fixed on the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, a glimmer of hopeful light flickering in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
He immediately channeled his spiritual energy and returned the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat to its normal size.<br/>
<br/>
After that, he placed Sun Lingtong inside the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he positioned the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat inside the stone monster’s corpse once again, recreating the scene from before.<br/>
<br/>
The Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat was forced once more to release its forbidden arts, revealing the entire text of the “Great Arts of Heaven and Earth Embryonic Breathing.”<br/>
<br/>
A layer of stone clothing began to cover Sun Lingtong’s body.<br/>
<br/>
This time, the stone clothing spread far more slowly than before.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked on, deeply worried, his gaze falling upon the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat as he fiercely injected spiritual energy into it.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, the boat’s magical prohibition disappeared, and the stone clothing on Sun Lingtong’s body began to recede!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s heart shook. He slapped his forehead in annoyance.<br/>
<br/>
The reason why the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat triggered its prohibitions was to protect itself; it therefore activated its full potential, using the power of heaven and earth to create an Embryonic state.<br/>
<br/>
Now that it was receiving powerful support from Ning Zhuo, naturally it would not push itself to the point of triggering the prohibitions.<br/>
<br/>
Without the Embryonic state, the essence of the stone clothing, which stemmed from the “principle” of the old monster within the stone, lacked the right environment to spread.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, furrowed his brow, and let his eyes flash with determination, striving to steady his mind.<br/>
<br/>
All that tossing around made him realize his own state—he could barely think straight!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth and immediately withdrew his spiritual energy. The Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat trembled, once again becoming isolated and helpless. The trace of a new spirit born within it went all-out to save itself.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong once again attained the Embryonic state, and the stone clothing gradually spread.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s getting slower and slower!” Ning Zhuo noticed the stone clothing’s spreading speed decreasing. At this rate, it would fail to reach Sun Lingtong’s head before stopping.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo abruptly looked at the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat.<br/>
<br/>
He steeled himself, casting a golden-element spell. A cluster of golden light, as sharp as swords and needles, swirled in his palm.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo placed his palm upon the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat and began rubbing.<br/>
<br/>
Zzzzz…<br/>
<br/>
The golden gleam was extremely sharp, piercing the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat. For a moment, sparks burst forth in every direction.<br/>
<br/>
Under the assault, the boat trembled slightly, unleashing hidden potential. Its forbidden arts glowed several times brighter.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s Embryonic state became even more intense!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo watched in delight as the stone clothing on Sun Lingtong’s body regained its previous rate of growth, resolutely climbing toward his head until it wrapped him completely.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s working!”<br/>
<br/>
With his divine sense focused on Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo perceived that Sun Lingtong’s injuries were suppressed by the stone clothing.<br/>
<br/>
However, the good news did not last long.<br/>
<br/>
Although the stone clothing covered Sun Lingtong, the cracks of the void gradually appeared on the stone clothing.<br/>
<br/>
“According to its previous behavior, the stone clothing should have quickly expanded and thickened into stone skin.”<br/>
<br/>
Yet the stone clothing also began to tear.<br/>
<br/>
“But it’s being suppressed by void power, so it remains only a thin layer, and now the cracks of the void are infiltrating!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth and pressed both hands onto the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat.<br/>
<br/>
Zzzzz…<br/>
<br/>
His golden-element spell constantly stabbed the hull of the boat, forcing it to unleash greater potential.<br/>
<br/>
The Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat shook violently. Its full set of forbidden arts radiated a blinding light.<br/>
<br/>
The Embryonic state grew even stronger, bolstering Sun Lingtong’s body.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s entire body began to develop stone skin at a slow pace.<br/>
<br/>
The stone skin grew thicker and thicker, but when it reached three inches, it ceased growing.<br/>
<br/>
“Hmm?” Ning Zhuo’s recently relaxed brow creased again.<br/>
<br/>
He stared hard at the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat. “Little Boat, hang in there!”<br/>
<br/>
He poured out his spiritual energy and cast more spells, circling around the hull.<br/>
<br/>
The Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat was battered by numerous spells, trembling wildly. Its full set of forbidden arts lit up the ship’s cabin, making it bright as midday.<br/>
<br/>
Stone skin on Sun Lingtong’s body became even thicker, and from a small figure, he “grew” into a stout stone figure.<br/>
<br/>
“Not enough, not enough!”<br/>
<br/>
As Ning Zhuo infused his divine sense, he discovered that although the void cracks were greatly suppressed, a closer look revealed that they were still subtly growing.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo turned his gaze again to the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Boat.” He reached out to stroke its hull. “I believe in you! Come on!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out a quick shout. His spiritual energy surged, transforming into a swirl of five-colored radiance.<br/>
<br/>
All kinds of five-element spells played out within that radiance, enveloping the hull of the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat from the outside.<br/>
<br/>
The Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat was no longer merely trembling but now violently shaking, seemingly wanting to escape the five-colored radiance.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo held it firmly in place with both hands, preventing it from being shaken off.<br/>
<br/>
The boat’s complete set of forbidden arts expanded to three times its prior size, filling the cabin with brilliant white light. Under normal vision, one could see only a vast swath of whiteness!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s line of sight was obstructed, but his divine sense continuously monitored the conditions of the boat and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
“The Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat is at its limit!” Ning Zhuo sensed that cracks had appeared on its hull.<br/>
<br/>
The void cracks had almost stalled.<br/>
<br/>
But only almost!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth in frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he thought of a certain demon god.<br/>
<br/>
As the idea surfaced, he spread out his divine sense, controlling the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
The doors in the cabin opened one by one, and a string of prayer beads was drawn over by an invisible force, brought to Ning Zhuo’s side.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that after Ning Zhuo subdued the Dice-Bone Demon God, it had taken the form of these dice-shaped prayer beads.<br/>
<br/>
Because he had yet to be entirely sure of the demon god’s loyalty, he had placed it in an empty compartment aboard the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon while masquerading as the Old Stone Monster.<br/>
<br/>
“Dice-Bone Demon God, quickly display your domain and accept us inside.” Ning Zhuo gave the order.<br/>
<br/>
The prayer beads immediately transformed back into the Dice-Bone Demon God.<br/>
<br/>
It prostrated itself on the floor. “In the presence of my master, this old slave dares not call itself demon or god. Rest assured, Master, this old slave will do its utmost!”<br/>
<br/>
In the next instant, the dice domain spread out, enveloping both Sun and Ning, as well as the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat and the stone sphere.<br/>
<br/>
A die appeared above Sun Lingtong’s head, spinning until it landed on six.<br/>
<br/>
The Dice-Bone Demon God’s two dice eyes were cast, each showing a one.<br/>
<br/>
“What?!” The demon god was dumbfounded.<br/>
<br/>
How could this happen after it pledged loyalty to Ning Zhuo?<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, the die above Ning Zhuo’s head also showed a six.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, six plus one plus one equaled eight, which was greater than Sun Lingtong’s single six.<br/>
<br/>
The void cracks on Sun Lingtong were suppressed, and the stone skin continued to grow a little faster.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t underestimate those few slight increases —they brought about a genuine breakthrough!<br/>
<br/>
At last, the void cracks stopped eroding and expanding, coming to a complete halt.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo finally felt satisfied and stopped harming the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat.<br/>
<br/>
Crack, crack—<br/>
<br/>
The Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat’s hull was covered with fissures.<br/>
<br/>
The Dice-Bone Demon God was also on one knee; cracks appeared on its skeletal frame. Even one of the dice serving as its eyeballs shattered.<br/>
<br/>
Its strength was severely damaged!<br/>
<br/>
“Old Dice, you did well,” Ning Zhuo reassured him.<br/>
<br/>
The Dice-Bone Demon God immediately declared that to work for Ning Zhuo —even if it meant death and obliteration —would be worth it!<br/>
<br/>
“Return.”<br/>
<br/>
With Ning Zhuo’s command, the Dice-Bone Demon God resumed its form as a string of prayer beads, voluntarily attaching to Ning Zhuo’s wrist.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cast his divine sense over Sun Lingtong, verifying again that the latter’s injuries were contained.<br/>
<br/>
All the void cracks were subdued, no longer spreading or growing.<br/>
<br/>
“The Boss absorbed that marrow and needs time to digest it.”<br/>
<br/>
“In this respect, I can’t do much to help.”<br/>
<br/>
“But as long as his body hasn’t collapsed, there’s still hope!”<br/>
<br/>
Once Ning Zhuo confirmed that Sun Lingtong’s injuries were stable, he plopped down onto the floor.<br/>
<br/>
He was utterly spent; his clothes were drenched in sweat, and his entire body was limp.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, he just sat there, not wanting to move at all.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, in Wooden Wheel Town—<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling had also collapsed onto the altar, her hair disheveled and her eyes glaring. “Not dead!”<br/>
<br/>
“The Old Stone Monster was struck by my method, and he’s still not dead!!”<br/>
<br/>
“He’s still alive.”<br/>
<br/>
“This is impossible!”<br/>
<br/>
“In order to ensure a guaranteed kill this time, I used at least ten national-power bricks!”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling could still sense her storage bag’s aura.<br/>
<br/>
However, its position did not remain fixed, and it was in total disarray. If she tried to pinpoint it carefully, she would mix it up with normal directional senses.<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling was no stranger to this situation. “The Old Stone Monster is located in the void. In the void, there’s no concept of front and back, left and right, northeast, southwest, or distance. That’s why this illusion occurs.”<br/>
<br/>
“He could endure my Starfall Heavenly Punishment Technique, and he can traverse the void physically…”<br/>
<br/>
“That means… he’s at the Soul Formation level?!”<br/>
<br/>
A flicker of shock showed on Shuang Ling’s face.<br/>
<br/>
If the Thousand Peaks Forest side gained a second being on that level, it would definitely have a huge effect on the entire war.<br/>
<br/>
This kind of major military news, Shuang Ling absolutely did not dare ignore.<br/>
<br/>
Suppressing her indignation and anger, she descended from the altar and hurried to the central command tent to meet Commander Du Tiechuan.<br/>
<br/>
When Du Tiechuan heard Shuang Ling’s report, his face grew serious. In a low voice, he said, “Soul Formation level!”<br/>
<br/>
“Judging from how the Old Stone Monster fought, there’s no doubt he’s of that level.”<br/>
<br/>
“Your Highness, you’ve made a major contribution this time by uncovering such critical intelligence! It’s of utmost importance to our forces.”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling’s face was ashen, hardly showing any pride. “The Old Stone Monster took my dais and treasures, and most of my assets are now in his hands.”<br/>
<br/>
“I sensed his final place of stay here!”<br/>
<br/>
As she spoke, she used the Thousand Peaks Forest map in the command tent and pointed to a certain location.<br/>
<br/>
Du Tiechuan followed her gaze. “Bikong Mountain?”<br/>
<br/>
“The Golden Halberd Army is about to arrive at Bikong Mountain. I will immediately pass along the latest intelligence and urge them to guard against the Old Stone Monster with the greatest caution!”<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, Du Tiechuan again looked intently at Shuang Ling. “Your Highness, you’re certain that as long as the Old Stone Monster steps out of the void, you’ll be able to sense him?”<br/>
<br/>
Shuang Ling replied, “As long as I set up my altar and as long as he hasn’t cracked my methods and hasn’t left the Two Zhu Nations, I can sense him.”<br/>
<br/>
“To be precise, I can sense the presence of my many daises!”<br/>
<br/>
Back on the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon—<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong used his divine sense to contact Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Overjoyed, Ning Zhuo hurried to the Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat.<br/>
<br/>
He might have been mistaken, but when the damaged Fetal Breath Spiritual Boat “saw” Ning Zhuo, its hull trembled slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo spoke with his divine sense. “Boss, you’re awake? How’s your recovery? How do you feel?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had already used his divine sense to inspect himself. With a single thought, he guessed that Ning Zhuo had saved him.<br/>
<br/>
But he did not utter any words of gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
Given the relationship between Ning Zhuo and himself, such words were unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said, “Right now, I feel very bored!”<br/>
<br/>
“Hurry up and let me out, Little Zhuo.”<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, but your injuries…” Through his divine sense, Ning Zhuo scanned Sun Lingtong’s entire body and was delighted to find he was completely healed!<br/>
<br/>
“Hahaha!” Sun Lingtong spoke via divine sense. “Who am I?! I am Sun Lingtong, your boss, yeah!”<br/>
<br/>
“This sort of little injury is nothing at all.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly, giving him a thumbs-up. “Boss, you really are my Boss!”<br/>
<br/>
He did not mention a word about Sun Lingtong coughing blood and passing out before.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had recovered extremely well, far beyond Ning Zhuo’s expectations.<br/>
<br/>
“This proves the Boss’s insight and talent in the void are unbelievably remarkable.”<br/>
<br/>
“After all, he’s only practiced the Virgin Boy Technique, yet he even has that Void Mark.”<br/>
<br/>
“No wonder his master values him so highly!”<br/>
<br/>
While thinking, Ning Zhuo removed the thick stone skin from Sun Lingtong, granting him freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong stood on the floor tiles, moving his limbs and bouncing on his toes, then grinned.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, watch this!”<br/>
<br/>
He stretched out his hand, palm facing the storage bag at Ning Zhuo’s waist.<br/>
<br/>
That storage bag had been emitting a faint starry glow.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, as Sun Lingtong performed his thieving technique, the storage bag went dim, and the glow disappeared entirely.<br/>
<br/>
“Boss!” Ning Zhuo was overjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong placed both hands on his hips, bursting into laughter. “See that? Did you see that?!”<br/>
<br/>
“I absorbed the evil god’s marrow from the void —oh wait, to be precise, the Void Mark in my sea of consciousness absorbed it.”<br/>
<br/>
“That mark has already undergone a mutation, a qualitative change, enabling me to use a lot more tricks.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thieving arts, spells, martial arts —anything involving space has seen a tremendous boost!”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m terrifyingly strong now!!”<br/>
<br/>
When he finished speaking, Sun Lingtong stretched out his five fingers, then clenched his small fist tightly. He pressed his lips together, his little face turning red as he tried to strike a “fierce” expression.<br/>
<br/>

Author Note:<br/>
<br/>
My daily routine is a bit messed up again. I need to adjust it. I am feeling better now, and I am worried that my illness will relapse, which will really affect my writing state.<br/>
<br/>
So I ask for a day off from everyone. (I will make it up later!)</div>
