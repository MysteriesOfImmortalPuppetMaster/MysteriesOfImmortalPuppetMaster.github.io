<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Behave yourself later, or I'll smack you again!" Wang Lan's expression grew increasingly stern as she spoke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Ji felt a sourness in his heart. He couldn't help but recall the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">When young Ning Zhuo would return late after playing and missing mealtime, there would only be cold leftovers on the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Who told you to come back so late? Hehe, you'll get nothing to eat," Ning Ji, having eaten his fill, would sit and mock him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo would stick out his tongue and sit down, about to pick up the chopsticks to eat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Slap.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Wang Lan would smack the chopsticks out of Ning Zhuo's hand, causing them to fall to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Have some manners!" Wang Lan's face would be cold. "There's dirt under your fingernails. Have you forgotten what I taught you? Go wash your hands!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Yes," Ning Zhuo would respond, his face pale, holding his red hand as he hurriedly left the round stool to wash his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">With this delay, the bell would ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Time's up. Clear the dining room. Oh dear, Ah Zhuo has nothing to eat!" Ning Ji would gloat, clapping his hands.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Husband?" Wang Lan would look at Ning Ze with hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Ze, with an indifferent expression, would slowly stand up and leave his seat. "Rules are rules and must not be relaxed."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"Yes, husband," Wang Lan would lower her head in response.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo would step into the dining room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The child who once ran to wash his hands, holding his red hand, had grown into a sixteen-year-old youth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Dressed in white, with calm eyes, he walked in slowly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Both Ning Ji and Wang Lan felt a sense of time flying by, as if years had passed in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Wang Lan collected her emotions and immediately stood up, showing Ning Zhuo a warm smile. "Ah Zhuo, you're here. Now we can start eating."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo bowed and greeted, "Aunt."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Then he looked at Ning Ji and smiled slightly, "Cousin."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Ji nodded, his expression complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Wang Lan said, "Oh, you are still so polite. No need for such formalities here. Please, sit down."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Wang Lan guided Ning Zhuo to sit next to her. However, she did not sit in the main seat. The main seat at the round table was empty, reserved for Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Seeing this, Ning Zhuo understood Wang Lan's warm reception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Sure enough, not long after they started eating, Wang Lan mentioned Ning Ze, "Ah Zhuo, what your uncle did was indeed wrong, withholding what rightfully belonged to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"You're a kind-hearted child, otherwise, you wouldn't have chosen to forgive your uncle. Your father's brother is your uncle, and we are truly a family!" As she spoke, Wang Lan felt an intense sense of grievance and hidden anger. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">She knew very well that this was all nonsense! But since Ning Xiaoren had already made his arrangements, Ning Ze had no choice but to go along with it, and Wang Lan had to follow suit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo said, "Aunt, you're right. The closest people to me in this world are still you all. When I first heard this news, to be honest, I was very angry. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But after some time, I came to terms with it. After all, he is my uncle, and you are my closest relatives. All I ask is for the embezzled money and resources to be returned."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"We never embezzled anything! That Ning Xiaoren is a complete scoundrel, and you believe everything he says?!" Wang Lan raged internally, her anger twisting her smile into a grotesque expression. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">She forced herself to suppress her anger, saying, "Yes, we will return it. But it has to be done in installments because the amount is so large that we can't provide it all at once."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"I understand completely," Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">As he spoke, he observed Ning Ji and Wang Lan. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The embryonic form of his divine ability had already been quietly activated. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Unlike before, now his life thread divine ability lotus had already grown a segment of the stem. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This embryonic form of the divine ability made him realize that he could now gather his power quietly and activate his divine ability without being noticed. As long as the target wasn't very strong, he could conceal his aura to the utmost degree, achieving complete stealth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The reason Ning Zhuo chose to stay at his uncle's house, apart from avoiding the heavy surveillance at Ning Xiaoren's residence, was also to test his divine ability. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The life thread divine ability's control strength increased with the depth of understanding. In this world, he understood Ning Ze's family the best. After all, they had spent over a decade together, day and night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">In Ning Zhuo's vision, a life thread gradually formed above Ning Ze's head. Unlike the life threads used during soul extraction in the Lava Immortal Palace, the one Ning Zhuo controlled was very thin and semi-transparent. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Soon, a life thread appeared above Wang Lan's head as well. Neither mother nor son noticed anything.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo attempted to control it. Suddenly, Ning Ji grabbed his throat and made a choking sound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"What's wrong?" Wang Lan, who was about to continue persuading Ning Zhuo, was interrupted by Ning Ji's sudden condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Ji's face turned red as he said, "I ate some fish and got a bone stuck in my throat." Wang Lan snorted and ignored him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">She continued, "Little Zhuo, you see, your uncle has been in the private prison for so many days. You know the conditions in that place; it's not fit for humans. I've tried to see the young clan leader, but he refused to meet us. Little Zhuo, I was hoping you could... cough, cough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Wang Lan suddenly started coughing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo quickly handed her a cup. "Aunt, please speak slowly and don't get excited."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Wang Lan thanked him, took the cup, and drank some water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Ah, ah!" This time, she coughed even more severely because she choked on the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Forgive me, Little Zhuo." It took Wang Lan a long time to recover, losing the emotional buildup she had previously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Of course, Ning Zhuo didn't tell her that all of her reactions were the result of his experiment with the divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Wang Lan sighed, just about to continue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Ji once again grabbed his throat, his mouth wide open, making strange noises.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"What now?" Wang Lan frowned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Ji looked pitifully. "I, I got another fish bone stuck in my throat."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"You're this grown and still can't eat fish properly! Unbelievable!" Wang Lan glared fiercely at Ning Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Ji quickly bowed his head, looking submissive as he braced for the scolding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">After Wang Lan reprimanded him a few more times, Ning Ji's face turned increasingly red, and he became visibly uncomfortable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">"What's wrong now?" Wang Lan asked sharply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"Mother, I need to use the restroom," Ning Ji said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The intense urge to relieve himself made him desperate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Go, quickly," Wang Lan said, not wanting to look at him anymore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Ji immediately got up and walked out of the dining room quickly, moving awkwardly. As he crossed the threshold, he accidentally passed gas.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo manipulated the life thread, causing Ning Ji's left foot to trip over his right. Ning Ji had only taken a few steps past the door before he fell headfirst to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Wang Lan's eyes widened, and she was just about to scold him when she choked on her own saliva, coughing uncontrollably for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and raised his hand to stop Wang Lan from speaking further. "Aunt, I understand what you're trying to say. Don't worry, I will plead with the young clan leader to release my uncle as soon as possible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Hearing this, Wang Lan was so excited that she slapped her thigh. "Oh, Little Zhuo, you're such a good child, you're wonderful! Auntie is so grateful to you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo said, "Let's continue eating."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Wang Lan eagerly used the communal chopsticks to serve Ning Zhuo some food. However, midway through, the food fell onto the table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Wang Lan felt very embarrassed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Aunt, there's no need for you to do this. I can serve myself," Ning Zhuo said as he used his chopsticks to pick up a fish eye and placed it into his mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Just a small taste was enough for Ning Zhuo to become deeply infatuated with this feeling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Life Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">As long as it was used, as long as it attached to someone, the behavior and actions of the cultivator would be partially controlled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Take Ning Zhuo’s recent experiment for example, Wang Lan and Ning Ji both exhibited minor behaviors and made multiple mistakes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"This feeling, this feeling... it’s truly indescribably wonderful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">It was as if everything could be easily influenced by him, as if everything was under his control!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo was deeply entranced by this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"How does it taste?" Wang Lan asked with concern, "I made this fish myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">While chewing the tasteless fish eye, Ning Zhuo nodded, his eyes showing a slight cold glint. He sincerely exclaimed, "The taste... it's really excellent."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
