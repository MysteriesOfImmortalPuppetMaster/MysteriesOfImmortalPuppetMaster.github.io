<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 297: The Head of the Branch Family!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"Split the family? Utter nonsense!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Ning Zhuo's antics are one thing, but all of you, grown adults, are following along in this folly!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"I do not approve of the family split!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Upon hearing this news, Ning Jiufan was furious and immediately called a halt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">"A split family would greatly damage the fate energy of our Ning family."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Ning Zhuo is the son who will bring prosperity to the family; he cannot be separated lightly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"If a split family were to occur during my stewardship and led to the further decline of the Ning family, how will I face our ancestors in the underworld?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Jiufan's stance was resolute.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He was the only Golden Core stage cultivator in the entire Ning family and his declaration immediately overturned the entire situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"What, our clan's Golden Core ancestor has stopped it?" Upon hearing the bad news, Ning Zhuo's expression turned grim.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The envoy he was dealing with wore a mournful face: "The family had already brought your bloodline umbilical cord, the branch family plaque, and the ancestral tablets, but they were intercepted halfway by the ancestor and confiscated." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"The Clan Leader specifically instructed me to ensure you understand that this is not because the main branch of the Ning family is unwilling to cooperate, but because the arm cannot twist the thigh." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo fell silent, lost in thought. His fingers subconsciously traced the lid of his cup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After a long silence, he spoke: "I understand this matter, and I believe in the sincerity of cooperation from the main branch." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"This is not your fault, nor mine; it was an unexpected incident."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"I will still follow the previous agreement, release Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, and recruit Ning Xiaoren under my command to help him achieve merits." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"But I hope the main branch of the Ning family will exert its strength and join me in persuading the old ancestor." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Take my wish back with you." The envoy, with mixed emotions, respectfully took his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Jiufan had always ignored mundane affairs, yet unexpectedly intervened in this matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Was it because the matter of family separation was significant, or had Ning Zhuo himself been under Ning Jiufan's constant watch? Or perhaps both?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Not long after, Ning Zhuo took the initiative to visit Ning Jiufan, bringing up the matter of separating the family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Jiufan snorted coldly with a face full of displeasure, and directly gave Ning Zhuo a scolding: "You still have the nerve to bring it up?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"I thought you were keeping quiet for a while, but you came up with something big as soon as you spoke."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo pleaded: "This time, it's Ning Xiaohui's grandmother..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Ning Jiufan immediately interrupted: "I don't want to hear it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Since she made a mistake, she should be dealt with according to family rules. This is not a bargaining chip for you to seek personal gain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Ning Jiufan glared: "How did I instruct you before? I told you not to let mundane affairs distract your energy and time, to focus entirely on the palace examination." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">"What have you done?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Or do you think your achievements are already outstanding enough to relax?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, Ning Zhuo quickly said: "Ancestor, please calm your anger for now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Forgive my boldness, but even if you stop me this time, can you stop my resolve?" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"I am serious about the family separation, and my determination is unwavering!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"I firmly believe: splitting from the main branch is a mutual release; each will have its own future. On the contrary, living together breeds resentment and mutual hindrance. In the end, we will end up with bloody conflicts and unspeakable tragedies!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"If it comes to that, you, Ancestor, will also bear some responsibility."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Jiufan was furious: "You brat!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The aura of the Golden Core stage erupted, pressing Ning Zhuo to his knees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo knew this was a critical moment, and despite blood trickling from his mouth, he stubbornly raised his head: "Ancestor, if you don't believe me, how about we make a bet?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Jiufan's momentum paused: "What bet?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">With a secretly made bet, Ning Zhuo left the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He sighed deeply; this was the best result he could strive for with all his might.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Having reached this point, Ning Zhuo was certainly unwilling to give up, so he decided to gamble with the Ning family's Ancestor!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Even though the family separation was not established, Ning Zhuo still released Ning Xiaohui's grandmother and took in Ning Xiaoren. This aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the subordinates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The side branch family was already quite resentful of the main branch, and Ning Zhuo, whom they saw as a promising future leader, had been outrageously obsequious to them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Moreover, the couple Ning Ze and Wang Lan, who were grieving the loss of their son, were stirring up trouble everywhere, spreading rumors that Ning Zhuo had changed and had secretly reached an agreement with the main branch, receiving great benefits while abandoning the entire Ning family side branch.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">They wanted to force Ning Zhuo to prove his innocence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">And how to prove innocence?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Nothing more than pursuing the culprit and avenging his cousin Ning Ji!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Due to the internal traitors like Ning Xiangguo, the City Lord's mansion saw the flaw and quickly seized the opportunity to secretly cooperate with Ning Ze and Wang Lan to stir up a wave of opposition against Ning Zhuo within the Ning family side branch, hoping Ning Zhuo would come forward to explain the reasons and process.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo, however, did not show up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He knew that if he appeared, he would inevitably have to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">And once he retreated, having eliminated Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, he would lose the most important bargaining chip. How could the many elders of the Ning family still recognize his proposal for a family split?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">At the very least, he should maintain the hope of a family split and not let this hope diminish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Meanwhile, the progress of the second stage of the palace examination reached a critical point, forcing Ning Zhuo to focus his main energy in the examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The eighteenth round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The content of the round had undergone slight changes â€” the arena was open, the preparation stage was concealed, and cultivators were allowed to use spells to assist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong began their battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong released the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, urging Ning Zhuo to surrender directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Unexpectedly, after Ning Zhuo finished his preparations, he did not create any mechanical puppets but simply crafted over twenty flying mechanical hands!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"The one who should surrender is you, Sun Lingtong!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"I will reclaim all the humiliation of being coerced and oppressed by you over the years in this battle today!" Ning Zhuo shouted, his fighting spirit extremely high.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In the next moment, over twenty flying hands soared into the air, simultaneously casting spells on the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The eruption of spells was extremely powerful, and such an extreme configuration of over twenty flying hands pushed the attack power to the limit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was engulfed in a dazzling storm of spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">It struggled fiercely, taking down nearly ten flying hands, but ultimately it fell, its body riddled with wounds, a pitiful sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"No, my mechanical battle ape! You brat, you're dead!!" Sun Lingtong screamed, eyes blazing with fury, glaring at Ning Zhuo as if wanting to devour him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Having long been involved in the black market and trained by his master since childhood, Sun Lingtong's acting skills were not weak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo fearlessly sneered, shouting excitedly: "Sun Lingtong, do you know how long I've waited for this day? You think I don't know? In fact, I've secretly investigated and studied your mechanical ape many times!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">The observing cultivators were thrilled by this outcome, cheering loudly!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">During this period, Sun Lingtong had been undefeated, truly too dominant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Unexpectedly, this time, Ning Zhuo managed to win by luck.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Indeed, in the eyes of many cultivators, Ning Zhuo merely took an extreme approach to the arena competition, not crafting conventional mechanical puppets, but instead betting everything on over twenty flying hands to cast spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">However, those with keen minds secretly noted Ning Zhuo's earlier "excited" shout, claiming he had secretly researched the mechanical ape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">If he had researched it, why didn't Ning Zhuo share the valuable information he knew when the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng first appeared, allowing everyone to benefit?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">If he had shared, perhaps they could have defeated Sun Lingtong too!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">This undoubtedly made everyone realize that even when Ning Zhuo confessed and submitted, he still concealed much information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">This information could provide him with certain advantages.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Like this victory in the arena, it was aided by the information he possessed. It was precisely because Ning Zhuo had an unusual understanding of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng that he could secure an advantage in the initial bombardment and clinch the victory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Thus, after this day's palace examination, envoys came to Ning Zhuo to purchase information.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo declined them all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The next day, during the palace examination, people were surprised to find that Sun Lingtong no longer used the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Sun Lingtong, with a gloomy face, always stared at Ning Zhuo, the hatred and anger in his eyes almost overflowing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">As a result, people speculated that Ning Zhuo's battle the previous day had severely damaged the mechanical ape, making it impossible to repair in the short term.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo thus received more praise, and without the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, people were less concerned about the information he held.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">In the subsequent palace examinations, Sun Lingtong no longer used the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This was to ensure his defeat and align his performance with Ning Zhuo's. In this way, the rankings on the leaderboard for "Ning Zhuo" and "Entry Standard" would not have a significant disparity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">If there was a disparity, and the rankings did not match the performances of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, cultivators would naturally easily guess that the name and the person did not match the truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The twentieth round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Placed On the table was the Five Elements Transformation Disk.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">In addition, there were several other mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Whoever could design an appropriate plan to utilize all these mechanical components would not have a poor performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">While others were preparing and testing the functions of the mechanical components, Ning Zhuo picked up the Five Elements Transformation Disk and used it with great familiarity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">This scene was noticed by many cultivators in the observation seats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">From the twenty-first round onwards, the examination tested large-scale mechanisms. It further allowed cultivators to choose an outsider to act as an assistant in crafting the mechanism and participate in the palace examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The twenty-second round.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The round provided another mechanical component, the Blood Path Diagram!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Ning Zhuo once again easily handled it, almost using it immediately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Xiaoren was chosen by him to act as an assistant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">He ordered Ning Xiaoren to provide his essence blood. Ning Zhuo then used this essence blood to perform the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, crafting the Blood Path Diagram.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"Not enough, not enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"More!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"I need more!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Under Ning Zhuo's relentless demands, Ning Xiaoren's complexion quickly turned pale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He showed a look of horror: "A person's essence blood is limited. Ning Zhuo, if you keep making me give it, I will die!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo's expression was cold: "Ning Xiaoren, didn't you want to achieve merits? Didn't you confess to me and swear to atone for your sins? If so, now is your best chance to redeem yourself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Ning Xiaoren was shocked: "You want me to die?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"Follow my orders!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"No, no!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Xiaoren retreated in panic, but on the arena, there was nowhere to retreat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Ning Zhuo sneered: "Even if you don't want to die, you have no choice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">He suddenly turned his gaze to another arena, where Ning Jiufan and the Ning family Clan Leader stood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"Clan Leader, Ning Xiaoren is your son. Do you think he should sacrifice himself for the family?" Ning Zhuo called out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Many cultivators turned to look.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">This scene was quite interesting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">The Ning family Clan Leader's face was ashen, struggling greatly, and finally, with great pain, he said: "My son, it is indeed time for you to sacrifice yourself for the family! Do not disgrace our main branch!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Ning Zhuo laughed heartily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">"Father!" Ning Xiaoren cried out in disbelief, filled with terror and helplessness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">However, contrary to the Ning family Clan Leader's expectations, Ning Zhuo did not actually kill Ning Xiaoren, only draining him until he was on the brink of death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">After the palace examination ended that day, Ning Zhuo brought the unconscious Ning Xiaoren to see Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Beside Ning Jiufan, the Ning family Clan Leader was stammering and sweating profusely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Seeing Ning Zhuo approach, the Ning family Clan Leader couldn't hold back, angrily scolding: "Ning Zhuo, you set me up!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">It turned out that Ning Zhuo had already known about Ning Xiaoren's involvement in the kidnapping case through the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's hint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">He had quietly collected enough evidence to secretly blackmail the Ning family Clan Leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Only then did the Ning family Clan Leader realize that Ning Xiaoren had colluded with outsiders to harm his own family members, an unforgivable crime!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">That was why, during the day, when Ning Zhuo was about to drain Ning Xiaoren's blood, his behavior was strange. Though his expression was hesitant and struggling, he ultimately spoke to persuade Ning Xiaoren to sacrifice his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">As a result, after the palace examination ended, he was severely reprimanded by Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Only then did the Ning family Clan Leader realize that Ning Jiufan had long known about Ning Xiaoren's collusion with outsiders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Ning Zhuo bowed deeply, paying respects to Ning Jiufan, and simply said: "Ancestor, I won this bet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Jiufan glanced at the pale-faced Ning family Clan Leader, his tone extremely indifferent: "For the sake of your own power, you would sacrifice your own son; having a Clan Leader like you is truly a blessing for our Ning family!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">The Ning family Clan Leader collapsed to the ground, his eyes vacant with fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">"Our Ning family is a family of cultivation, maintained by kinship and bloodline. You didn't think to help your son, to free him from control and return him to the light; you only cared about your power and position." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"You have truly disappointed me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">After harshly criticizing the Ning family Clan Leader, Ning Jiufan looked at Ning Zhuo, his expression quite complex.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">He wanted to persuade him, but under Ning Zhuo's determined gaze, he still opened his storage belt and took out the bloodline umbilical cord, Ning family plaque, and ancestral tablets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">"Take them, my branch family Clan Leader."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ning Zhuo was overjoyed, quickly accepting them. After checking them on the spot, he bowed to Ning Jiufan: "The palace examination is not over. I will not immediately establish the branch family to avoid family turmoil." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">"Ancestor, after the branch family is established, it will still rely on your protection."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">Ning Jiufan snorted: "Get out of here, you brat, never letting anyone have peace of mind." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">"Lord Zhu is already outside your room, he came specifically to see you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"You can say whatever you want, or not. Remember, you are already the Clan Leader of our Ning family's branch family." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Ning Zhuo quickly expressed his gratitude and respectfully took his leave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
