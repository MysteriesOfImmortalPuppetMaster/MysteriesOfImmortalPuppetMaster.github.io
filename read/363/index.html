<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
After bidding farewell to Lin Shanshan, Ning Zhuo returned to his cave on Little Contention Peak. <br/>
<br/>
He first took out a meditation mat, sat down cross-legged, and began his daily routine of cultivation. Currently in the early Foundation Establishment stage, he was practicing three techniques simultaneously, requiring meditation, breath circulation, and the refinement of his blood energy. As a result, he spent about three times as long as others on cultivation each day.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to this, he trained intensively to improve his martial skills. He also had numerous external engagements, such as inspecting the medicinal fields in the mountains, negotiating major collaborations with the sect, and challenging higher-ranked demon cultivator Chang Yan. His schedule was extremely tight, down to the minute and second, leaving many tasks unfinished. For example, the time he could spend each day practicing his manipulation techniques for mechanisms was limited to the span of a tea break. The task of designing a mechanical body for Meng Yehu had been delayed so much that he hadn't even started.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo wished he could split himself in two to get everything done. Time was just too scarce!<br/>
<br/>
"And now, there's the added task of studying the Enlightenment Diagrams," he thought.<br/>
<br/>
After finishing his daily cultivation, Ning Zhuo took out three diagrams: "The Old Tree‚Äôs Rooted Image," "Listening to the Waves at Night in the Mountains," and "Peering at the Sky Beneath the Trees."<br/>
<br/>
From Lin Shanshan, he already knew the "mysteries" of these diagrams ‚Äî they corresponded to specific wood-element spells. He chose the first, relatively simpler one, and began his attempts at comprehension.<br/>
<br/>
Focusing intensely on the diagram, Ning Zhuo‚Äôs attention gradually became fully absorbed in it, unaffected by external distractions. His gaze traced the twists and turns of the roots in the picture. His thoughts followed the shape of the roots, observing every crossing, every vine's twist.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly, he began to grasp a natural rhythm. His breathing became deep and steady, his body leaning slightly forward as if he were about to enter the world within the painting. His heart grew calmer as he sensed the deep meaning contained within the image. However, just as he was nearing a state of resonance with the diagram, a sudden wave of hunger broke his concentration. He opened his eyes and realized that without noticing, he'd been meditating with his eyes closed for quite some time. Though his gaze hadn't rested on the image, his consciousness had been deeply immersed in the Insight Diagram.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's stomach growled, and a strong sense of fatigue and weakness washed over him. What felt like a brief moment was actually three full hours. Despite having taken a Fasting Pill, his body couldn't endure the energy consumption. At the same time, his divine sense was almost completely depleted, leaving him mentally drained.<br/>
<br/>
"The state of enlightenment from the Enlightenment Diagram sure is taxing," Ning Zhuo thought, both tired and pleased. This was his first time entering such a state, and it felt novel. Additionally, he was pleasantly surprised. He had previously worried that he might not be able to comprehend the wood-element Enlightenment Diagram, but now it seemed that, while he had little talent in ice-related elements, his aptitude for wood-based techniques was not bad at all.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shared his experience with Sun Lingtong, who said, "Being able to enter the state of insight on the first try is rare. You definitely have a bright future if you continue down the path of wood-element cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo suggested, "Boss, you should also try comprehending these diagrams. After all, they're borrowed, and we'll have to return them when the time comes."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was intrigued and agreed. "You go into the mechanical dragon first, and I'll keep watch for you."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then entered the mechanical dragon, had some spirit food, rested briefly, and adjusted his condition. Next, he retrieved a willow tree from the storage chamber. The tree, with a large clump of earth still attached to its roots, stood upright on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo set down his mat and sat under the tree. The willow‚Äôs vitality was hidden yet strong, with delicate yellow twigs and evergreen leaves as thin as jade, nearly translucent when backlit. This was a "Spirit Concealment Willow."<br/>
<br/>
As he sat under the tree, its fragrance, reminiscent of sandalwood and orchids, filled him with tranquility and clarity. Before he even adjusted his mindset, Ning Zhuo already felt refreshed, his mind sharp and untroubled, with his divine sense stirred and his wisdom flowing.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúWhat a fine tree,‚Äù he thought with anticipation, and took out the Old Tree's Rooted Image to resume his study.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, it felt as though he had stepped into the world within the painting. He found himself barefoot, standing among vines and roots, feeling their rough texture, their meandering strength, and the restrained power within.<br/>
<br/>
Sensing Ning Zhuo‚Äôs enlightenment, the Spirit Concealment Willow‚Äôs leaves began to fall without wind, turning into green specks of light that quickly dissipated. Ning Zhuo‚Äôs body underwent a mysterious transformation; he felt himself growing taller, turning into a tree. Numerous vines sprouted from his body, spreading outwards slowly yet swiftly.<br/>
<br/>
These vines intertwined with the existing roots and vines, soft yet strong, containing boundless strength within their embrace. At that moment, divine inspiration sparked frequently in his upper dantian. He commanded the vines to extend and retract as easily as moving his own arms.<br/>
<br/>
The great tree before him was his teacher. He imitated and learned from it, becoming one with nature. In the entanglement of the vines, power burst forth, combining the flexibility of the vines with the resilience of the roots.<br/>
<br/>
He had comprehended it completely!<br/>
<br/>
Wood-element spell ‚Äî "Root and Vine Entanglement."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo opened his eyes suddenly, his gaze sharp. Looking again at the Old Tree's Rooted Image, he now understood everything, with no remaining mysteries.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúOnly a little over an hour passed?‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
He calculated the time, which seemed pitifully short. Yet what he had gained was dozens of times greater than his previous attempts.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúMoreover, I‚Äôm still in good shape. Not too drained, and I‚Äôm not even hungry. My divine sense still has about thirty percent left.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
He patted his stomach and looked up at the Spirit Concealment Willow beside him.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúWhat a great tree!‚Äù he exclaimed with heartfelt admiration.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he noticed that one of the willow's branches had lost all its leaves and turned dry and yellow, as if it had lost all moisture.<br/>
<br/>
After resting, Ning Zhuo took out the second diagram, "Listening to the Waves at Night in the Mountains."<br/>
<br/>
On a cliffside stood a simple wooden cabin. A cultivator leaned against the window facing the cliff, either practicing breath circulation, meditating, or listening intently. It was late at night, and the mountain range outside was a vast expanse of darkness. Only the faint light of a lamp illuminated a warm corner inside the cabin. The strong mountain wind blew the flickering lamp flame and the cultivator‚Äôs robe, while distant pine trees swayed faintly in the darkness.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the painting, however, was dominated by a vast, deep darkness, but upon close observation, subtle, sweeping arcs ‚Äî like waves connecting heaven and earth ‚Äî could be discerned.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo focused his mind and once again entered the painting. He became the guest leaning against the window, listening to the continuous sound of waves, the roaring tide of life, and the immense power of nature. After about an hour, he opened his eyes, still lingering in awe.<br/>
<br/>
He had comprehended the "Listening to the Waves at Night in the Mountains."<br/>
<br/>
Next, he took out the third diagram: "Peering at the Sky Beneath the Trees."<br/>
<br/>
The picture showed dense layers of leaves, forming a green canopy that nearly blocked out the sky. Only through tiny gaps between the leaves could one catch a glimpse of the bright blue sky above. In this world, the trees, branches, and leaves were everything, forming a self-contained universe.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immersed himself in the scene, sensing the isolation from the outside world. Yet, he wasn‚Äôt a prisoner ‚Äî he was the master of this forest, its king, its god! <br/>
<br/>
Two hours later, he opened his eyes again, completely exhausted. The "Peering at the Sky Beneath the Trees" was the most complex and profound of the three, but he had also comprehended it.<br/>
<br/>
Having mastered three new wood-element spells, Ning Zhuo saved himself much time and effort by directly understanding their deeper mysteries through the diagrams.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúWith just these three spells, I could've easily made sure that Han Zhou wouldn‚Äôt even get close!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo‚Äôs combat strength had risen significantly, boosting his confidence for the upcoming battle with Chang Yan.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúBoss, boss! It‚Äôs your turn. The Spirit Concealment Willow works wonders. I comprehended three spells in a row, and it was way easier than figuring them out on my own.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo called for Sun Lingtong, eager to share his joy.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong giggled, ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll give it a try too!‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo exited the mechanical dragon and continued his training.<br/>
<br/>
For the next few days, he maintained his martial arts practice with Lin Shanshan. His progress was swift, reaching a balance between offense and defense, with offense now accounting for almost fifty percent of his moves. <br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan praised his aptitude while asking about his progress with the Insight Diagrams. Ning Zhuo explained that he had made great strides with the Old Tree‚Äôs Rooted Image, but had yet to fully refine the others.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled, ‚ÄúTo make such progress in just one day, Ning Zhuo, I was right about you after all.‚Äù<br/>
