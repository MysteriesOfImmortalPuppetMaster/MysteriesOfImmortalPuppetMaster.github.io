<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
After bidding farewell, the sect disciple led Ning Zhuo up Small Contest Peak. Along the way, the disciple subtly probed and tested him multiple times.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was straightforward, explaining that he came from Fire Persimmon Immortal City to seek guidance and that he had met Lin Shanshan by chance, who helped him find his way.<br/>
<br/>
The disciple, satisfied with what he had gathered, relaxed his tone and became more casual in his mannerisms. During their conversation, Ning Zhuo "surprisingly" learned of Lin Shanshan’s true identity.<br/>
<br/>
The disciple teased him, “You’re a lucky one! Sister Lin is always this helpful, often guiding outsiders to this place.”<br/>
<br/>
“With such a sect spirit, Myriad Medicine Sect truly lives up to its reputation!” Ning Zhuo sincerely remarked.<br/>
<br/>
The disciple laughed heartily, but before leaving, he reminded Ning Zhuo, “You’ve just arrived and already gotten yourself a cave dwelling numbered in the 200s. Be cautious—according to the rules of our sect, if someone challenges you for your dwelling and wins, you’ll lose the right to stay there.”<br/>
<br/>
“Of course, if you’re confident in your abilities, you can challenge others for better dwellings.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo replied, “I’ll settle in first and observe the situation.”<br/>
<br/>
As he spoke, he took out ten spirit stones and slipped them into the disciple’s hand.<br/>
<br/>
“Just ten low-grade spirit stones...” the disciple thought with mild disdain, but he still accepted them with an emotionless expression.<br/>
<br/>
The memory of Ning Zhuo gifting two Mist Rust Orchids to Lin Shanshan was still fresh in the disciple’s mind. His tolerance for the meager gift in his hand had been considerably raised by comparison.<br/>
<br/>
“Make yourself comfortable,” the disciple said perfunctorily before turning and leaving without looking back.<br/>
<br/>
Halfway down the mountain, another figure emerged from the forest.<br/>
<br/>
The newcomer had a fair complexion, a plump build, and wore a broad smile. Bowing respectfully to the disciple, he swiftly handed him a mid-grade spirit stone.<br/>
<br/>
The disciple naturally accepted the mid-grade spirit stone and stored it in his belt, feeling rather pleased. He directly addressed the man, “Li Jingqing, your sources are quick. I know what you’re here to ask.”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re out of luck. The dwelling you’ve been eyeing has already been taken.”<br/>
<br/>
The plump, middle-aged cultivator rubbed his hands together, “So, I’m just here to inquire about who took my dwelling. I’ve heard that he was personally brought here by Senior Sister Lin?”<br/>
<br/>
The disciple nodded slightly, “That’s right, so don’t stir up any trouble.”<br/>
<br/>
Li Jingqing shook his head, “In cultivation, it’s all about contention. This is Small Contest Peak, after all. It’s too early for me to back down.”<br/>
<br/>
“From what I know, Senior Sister Lin has brought quite a few outsiders here in the past. So, this Ning Zhuo may not be anything special.”<br/>
<br/>
The disciple nodded again, “Since you’ve made up your mind...”<br/>
<br/>
“Considering the spirit stone, I’ll tell you the details.”<br/>
<br/>
“This Ning Zhuo really has no deeper connection with Senior Sister Lin. It’s their first meeting.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, unlike before, when Senior Sister Lin would bring people here in a rush, this time she took the initiative to ask about the dwelling and wasn’t satisfied with the first one I offered Ning Zhuo.”<br/>
<br/>
“I know you’ve been pulling strings to get that dwelling, and I did want to reserve it for you. But, in front of Senior Sister Lin, I couldn’t refuse and had to give it up.”<br/>
<br/>
“I see, what a shame!” Li Jingqing said with feigned regret. Before leaving, he forced another smile and handed the disciple another mid-grade spirit stone.<br/>
<br/>
Once he was alone, Li Jingqing’s expression turned dark.<br/>
<br/>
Myriad Medicine Valley had a natural geographical advantage, brimming with abundant spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
The spiritual energy permeated every cave dwelling on Small Contest Peak, providing cultivators with significant benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the cave dwellings closer to the front received periodic rewards from the sect.<br/>
<br/>
Li Jingqing was a merchant who frequently bought goods from Myriad Medicine Sect, selling medicinal herbs and pills elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The closer his dwelling was to the front, the better his connections with the sect, allowing him to purchase goods at a lower price. The profit difference in spirit stones was significant.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, even knowing that Ning Zhuo had been brought by Lin Shanshan, Li Jingqing had no intention of giving up easily. He left alone, deciding to plan carefully before taking action.<br/>
<br/>
He first tried to gather more information about Ning Zhuo, but after several days, he found little.<br/>
<br/>
This was because, after moving into his cave, Ning Zhuo rarely went out. Even when neighboring cultivators tried to visit, they were turned away.<br/>
<br/>
Li Jingqing knew that the next batch of herbs would mature soon, and with the time to sell approaching, he realized he couldn’t delay any longer. So, he decided to take the initiative.<br/>
<br/>
His cave was ranked behind Ning Zhuo’s, and according to the rules, Li Jingqing had the right to challenge Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
However, instead of doing so himself, he sought help.<br/>
<br/>
He had long considered various candidates and now picked the one he was most confident in convincing—Han Zhou.<br/>
<br/>
At Origin Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
In the Sect Master’s study.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan knocked on the door and brought tea and snacks to her father’s desk.<br/>
<br/>
“Father, you’ve been busy with sect affairs and haven’t slept all night. How about having some tea and taking a short break?”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan, a middle-aged man with a slim build and long beard, leaned back in his chair and sighed, “There’s no choice. In a few days, those herbs will be ready for harvest.”<br/>
<br/>
“The sect must carefully handle the sale of herbs. Every merchant and trading house needs to be dealt with properly.”<br/>
<br/>
“This is the foundation of our sect. Since I took over as Sect Master, I’ve always overseen this process personally. Do you know why?”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan smiled, “Father, you’re testing me, but this time you won’t stump me. I’ve heard from Senior Brother that before you took over, the sect was riddled with corruption. Especially in this process, even the most respected elders were gradually corrupted after holding such responsibility for so long.”<br/>
<br/>
“So, you decided to handle this yourself.”<br/>
<br/>
“Senior Brother praised you for being wise, diligent, and responsible.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan snorted, “That lazy boy, Linghu Jiu, loves his wine. There’s no way those words came from him.”<br/>
<br/>
“Are you trying to plead for him?”<br/>
<br/>
“If I don’t punish him for a good stretch of time, he won’t learn his lesson.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan stuck out her tongue at her father’s stern words and didn’t dare to bring up Linghu Jiu again.<br/>
<br/>
She noticed a batch of new jade slips on the bookshelf. “Father, please eat. I’ll put on something you like to watch.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan nodded slightly and began eating.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan retrieved several jade slips and a mechanical construct from the bookshelf.<br/>
<br/>
She placed three jade slips into the construct and activated it with her mana.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, colored sand emerged from the construct and rapidly formed a thin battlefield scene in mid-air. On the battlefield, two sand figures began to fight.<br/>
<br/>
The two sand figures fully replicated a past battle.<br/>
<br/>
As Lin Bufan watched the fight unfold, eating his snacks, his interest grew. It was his only pastime amidst his busy schedule.<br/>
<br/>
He occasionally made comments.<br/>
<br/>
“Zheng Xingchen may come from a cultivation family, but he practices demonic arts. His ruthlessness complements his techniques, which is why he wins repeatedly.”<br/>
<br/>
“Luo Xiao’s mechanical bone armor has been battle-tested, and he can now handle a variety of opponents. He’s come a long way since he first arrived.”<br/>
<br/>
“Han Zhou... this nameless beggar who is only referred to by the place he came from has quite an extraordinary cultivation method. It seems like a physical body cultivation on the surface, but its core resembles Buddhist techniques, emphasizing spiritual transformation and resilience.”<br/>
<br/>
“Lai Wuying’s sword keeps getting faster. Anyone outside the top ten cave dwellers won’t survive his first three strikes.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh? Chang Yan’s earth manipulation techniques have improved again. He would’ve lost this battle before, but now he barely scraped by with a win.”<br/>
<br/>
The Sect Master of Myriad Medicine Sect watched with great enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan asked, “Father, as a Nascent Soul cultivator, why do you take such interest in watching Foundation Establishment cultivators fight?”<br/>
<br/>
“Shouldn’t this be as dull to you as watching children brawl?”<br/>
<br/>
The Sect Master shook his head with a solemn expression, “Shanshan, you don’t understand.”<br/>
<br/>
“In combat, focusing solely on cultivation level is too narrow. You must know that tactics, combat will, and spellcasting techniques are aspects that stay with a cultivator for life.”<br/>
<br/>
“These things are just as valuable, even at the Nascent Soul stage and beyond.”<br/>
<br/>
“Of course, we proudly call ourselves the War Hall. I do love watching battles. Haha! It’s my only hobby.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan sighed, “You love watching battles, while Senior Brother loves drinking. You two really are a perfect master-disciple pair.”<br/>
<br/>
This time, the Sect Master did not scold Lin Shanshan but simply smiled.<br/>
<br/>
Just then, a subordinate came in with reports.<br/>
<br/>
More jade slips piled up on the Sect Master’s desk, waiting for him to handle. He sighed again. Though his body didn’t feel tired, his spirit was nearing its limit.<br/>
<br/>
Watching the battle had provided some relaxation, making him even more aware of his mental fatigue.<br/>
<br/>
“Let’s see which exciting matches will take place next on Small Contest Peak.”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh... Luo Xiao is challenging Zheng Xingchen again?”<br/>
<br/>
“Lai Wuying performed strongly in the last round, so no one will challenge him this time.”<br/>
<br/>
“Han Zhou is challenging... Ning Zhuo? Ning Zhuo?”<br/>
<br/>
The unfamiliar name caught the Sect Master by surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan let out a small gasp, her face showing concern.<br/>
<br/>
The Sect Master turned to his daughter, “Shanshan, you know this Ning Zhuo?”<br/>
<br/>
“Father, it’s like this,” Lin Shanshan explained the situation, clearly worried. “Han Zhou is one of the strongest on Small Contest Peak. Ning Zhuo has just arrived and is already being challenged by him—it doesn’t look good for him.”<br/>
<br/>
The Sect Master, stroking his long beard, felt a slight pang of curiosity. It was the first time he had seen Lin Shanshan so concerned about someone she had just met.<br/>
