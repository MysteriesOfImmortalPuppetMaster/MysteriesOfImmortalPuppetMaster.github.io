<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Thanks to the guidance of Ash Bone Elder, Luo Si cultivated diligently and gradually rose to prominence, becoming the foremost general under the command of the Underworld-Forgotten River.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Though he held immense authority, he bore no attachment to it - only a burning obsession with revenge, one that grew fiercer alongside his power and tormented him into near madness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Whenever his heart grew stifled with vengeance, he would come to the banks of the Underworld River to fish, letting the river’s current wash away the bitter flames gnawing at his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">When he received word from Ash Bone Elder that he would soon face a tribulation, Luo Si became excited rather than fearful. To him, this was proof that his long-awaited vengeance was finally within reach!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Tribulation itself was not his focus. What he craved was vengeance - vengeance!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">So he had immediately written back, asking Ash Bone Elder how to deal with the fated one he was destined to meet, and how best to secure a favorable connection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ash Bone Elder replied simply: act as you normally would. Any hint of pretense would be seen through, and only backfire, achieving half the result with double the effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Luo Si thus followed his instructions and sat fishing by the Underworld River for three days and three nights, silently waiting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Curiously, where ghostly figures would normally pass by the riverside, not a single soul had appeared over the past three days - until Sun Lingtong arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">At first sight of Sun Lingtong, Luo Si inwardly mused: “He’s only at Foundation Establishment stage. Could he really be my destined lord? No, Ash Bone Elder said I would meet the one who would shape my fate - it’s more likely this one is just a messenger.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">From the start, Luo Si treated Sun Lingtong with particular regard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Though Sun Lingtong’s cultivation was low and his youth evident, his life experiences were abnormally rich - especially his recent involvement in the Thousand Peaks Forest of the Two Note Kingdom, where he had nearly witnessed battles between Nascent Soul cultivators firsthand. In his eyes, a “mere” Nascent Soul like Luo Si wasn’t all that impressive anymore.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Nascent Souls had fallen in that war - so how could Luo Si expect reverence?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Seeing Sun Lingtong meet him with poise and without a hint of fear or flattery, Luo Si took mental note. He remained composed as instructed, going about his cultivation as if nothing unusual had occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Then, when his memory briefly slipped away and he saw the river’s waves ebbing, and his spare fishing rod now in Sun Lingtong’s hands, Luo Si grew even more convinced of the boy’s significance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">When Sun Lingtong expressed a desire to go to the world of the living, to the Ghostly Black Marshlands, Luo Si’s mind jumped: “Could it be that the one behind him has eyes on the Living Realm - especially White Paper Immortal City? If he truly intends to intrude upon the Living Realm… that’s perfect. If they don’t interfere with the mortal world, how will I ever achieve my vengeance?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Thus, Luo Si gave Sun Lingtong free passage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Of course, the deeper truth need not be spoken. Ash Bone Elder had warned him that disclosing too much would render any divinations null, introducing countless new variables that would require recalculation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Still, something had to be said. Without even a hint, it would be impossible to leverage this later. So he vaguely alluded to a coming tribulation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">As expected, Sun Lingtong and Ning were deeply intrigued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">This was their first encounter with something like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Ash Bone Elder?” Both of them quietly committed the name to memory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">At the same time, they grew far more cautious - wondering if this mysterious diviner could see through their true backgrounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Of all the spiritual arts, divination remained one of the most hidden and elusive. Few cultivators ever encountered its true practitioners.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong turned to Luo Si and asked, “You’re saying I can help you survive your tribulation? I’m just a humble Foundation Establishment cultivator. You may be overestimating me, Senior.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Clearly, he was probing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Luo Si shook his head and smiled. “I’m simply following Ash Bone Elder’s advice - three days and three nights of ordinary cultivation. Today is the third day, and you’re the only one I’ve encountered. If no one else appears, then it must be you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“As for your doubts, I have no answers either. By all logic, someone stronger would make more sense.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“But based on our conversation just now, I suspect my tribulation is tied to White Paper Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">At this, Luo Si let out a faint sigh. “A general dies in a hundred battles. I have no loved ones in the Underworld's Forgetful River, yet I’ve risen with unnatural ease - promotion after promotion without challenge. That’s a rarity. It may be that the entrenched powers of the underworld, knowing the coming conflict with White Paper Immortal City, chose to avoid involvement… and pushed me into the pit instead.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Both Ning and Sun Lingtong felt their hearts stir at this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Sun Lingtong asked, “Since that’s the case, Senior Luo Si… why remain loyal to the Underworld-Forgotten Prefecture?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Luo Si nodded solemnly. “Of course! First, though White Paper Immortal City is perilous, it’s not unconquerable. I must try. Second, I’ve enjoyed the privileges of this station - it’s only right I shoulder the responsibilities. That is my nature.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong paced in a small circle, clearly intrigued. “How fascinating. Truly fascinating.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">His curiosity was thoroughly piqued.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">He turned to Luo Si. “And if I change my mind and decide not to visit the Living Realm, what then?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Luo Si thought to himself, “Change your mind? More like you’ve got a mission to gather intelligence up there.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">He was just about to say it didn’t matter - when he recalled Ash Bone Elder’s advice. So instead, he spoke candidly:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“I think you should go. If you’re changing your mind, it’s because of what I’ve said. By speaking, I’ve added chaos to fate and altered the original path.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“For the sake of my tribulation - I’ll force you to go!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">“You, a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, could hardly stop me if I tried.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong let out a hearty laugh while secretly communicating with Ning Zhuo: “Little Zhuo, things aren’t looking too good on my end. I might not be in control of my body, but my mind is clear - I truly want to step into the game myself and personally experiment, to witness the profundity of divination and prophecy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">“Whether I can help Luo Si overcome his tribulation is secondary. If I take part directly, perhaps I can assist you in some way.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo nodded inwardly. “I also want to see just how wondrous this art of divination and foresight truly is.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">With their minds made up, Sun Lingtong turned to Luo Si and said, “No need to force me, Senior. I volunteer to go.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“However, since this involves helping you survive your tribulation, I fear the journey will be unimaginably dangerous. Might I ask if you have something useful to give me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Even an emperor doesn’t starve his soldiers,” he added with a grin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Luo Si nodded emphatically. “An army moves on its stomach - wise words. Speak, what do you want?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Sun Lingtong gave it some thought before answering, “If Senior would grant me a military post and allow me to lead troops into battle, perhaps I could better aid in your tribulation. Besides, I’ve always wanted to try being a general.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“Well said, boss!” Ning Zhuo praised him silently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">If Sun Lingtong secured an official military position, he could replicate his performance during the Thousand Peaks Forest campaign and leverage even greater strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Back then, his strength had plateaued at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm, unable to break through.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But now? Things had changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Since leaving the Two Note Kingdom, Ning Zhuo had traveled in seclusion for quite some time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">During that journey, his cultivation had advanced rapidly - he had leapt two full stages. With the aid of military authority and battlefield tactics, it was entirely possible to leverage power rivaling the Nascent Soul realm!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">However, Luo Si shook his head without hesitation, not even a flicker of doubt in his expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“Your origins are unclear. How could I casually hand you command? Wouldn’t that dishonor my responsibilities as a general?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Part of it was Luo Si’s own nature, but more importantly, the man before him might be tied to his future sovereign. He had to leave a good impression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">If he rashly granted military titles to outsiders, what would his future lord think of him? Would he still be entrusted with great responsibilities?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Luo Si regretted even asking what Sun Lingtong wanted. Fearing another demand he couldn’t fulfill, he quickly shifted tactics and pulled out a talisman from his robes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“I give you this Heaven-bestowed Talisman. For you, it will be of immense benefit!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Once you use it, you’ll immediately understand - it surpasses any elixir or pill you’ve ever consumed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Without waiting for refusal, Luo Si pressed the talisman into Sun Lingtong’s hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Sun Lingtong inspected it closely. The talisman was about three and seven-tenths inches long, made of obsidian jade, and shimmered with faint golden light. At its center was the full seal of the Four Yama Kings, and its edges were encircled by vivid depictions of the Eighteen Hells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Each depiction was lifelike. The frozen hell emanated a misty chill, while the guilty souls in the hell of karmic flames radiated a faint scent of char.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">On the reverse side, etched in vermilion ink, was the complete “Thirteen Chapters of the Underworld Law,” the characters glowing faintly with a blood-red aura.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Heaven-bestowed Talisman?” Sun Lingtong looked up in confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Luo Si nodded. “Many have come seeking the black snow, as it can deepen one’s cultivation and foundations. But where does the black snow come from?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“It’s the result of the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual, presided over by the Lord of the Underworld Palace.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“This rite draws on yang to nourish yin and has earned the praise of the heavens of the Underworld. It can enhance one’s foundations without backlash.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“The black snow is merely the cast-off residue of this divine favor. A cultivator bearing the Heaven-bestowed Talisman, however, can directly receive the finest essence from the ritual.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“I can’t make use of it, but Little Zhuo can!” Sun Lingtong’s eyes lit up, and he quickly offered his thanks before accepting the talisman.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Luo Si, after a moment’s thought, gave a final piece of advice: “The siege will proceed in two waves - one attacking head-on at the city walls, and the other infiltrating from within to stir up internal chaos, aiming for a pincer attack.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“You’ll be heading to the Living Realm. Don’t get involved in the infiltration. If you want to experience the battlefield, join the frontal assault on the walls.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong feigned confusion. “Senior Luo Si, what do you mean by that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Luo Si hesitated, then explained a bit further. “The situation is still unclear. The timing isn’t ripe to strike from within against the White Paper Immortal City.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“For example, this latest infiltration team includes six Golden Core ghost generals, targeting the southern gate. But I still believe they won’t succeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Sun Lingtong widened his eyes and deliberately asked, “Even six Golden Core ghost generals can’t cause an internal collapse?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“Is the City Lord of White Paper City personally taking action? But I heard she’s in poor condition, sealed in self-isolation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Luo Si replied, “Even without the City Lord herself, she has her paper avatar. Besides, the city runs deep. It was built by the great scholar of profound mysteries, a master at the Void Refining stage. This White Paper Immortal City was his crowning achievement - there must be many secrets yet uncovered.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Sun Lingtong nodded. “I understand now. Attacking the outer walls leaves room for retreat. But if one infiltrates the interior and gets discovered, there’s no turning back.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“But in that case, isn’t the infiltration team just being sent to their deaths?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Luo Si shook his head. “A general must be ruthless. Their sacrifice has value - it helps us probe the enemy’s depths. With that intelligence, we can avoid future losses to our main force.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Secondly, among the Ghost Generals this time is one known as the Silent Ghost General, born with a natural talent called No Sound, No Echo. With such an ability guarding the formation, our chances of ambush and retreat rise significantly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong immediately reminded him, “Little Zhuo, did you hear that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">“I did,” Ning Zhuo's vigilance sharpened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">He had heard of this innate talent before - those born with it could not produce any sound when they spoke, no matter what. Even their heavy footsteps were quieter than the light steps of ordinary people. One could say they were natural-born assassins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Knowing this made countermeasures easier to plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo immediately began constructing ideas for a secondary defensive formation in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Luo Si continued, “Time’s nearly up. You must join the main force and proceed together to the Living Realm.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sun Lingtong asked, “How do I get there?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">“There’ll be someone to guide you,” Luo Si replied. “But military routes are top secret. To ensure they’re not leaked, I will personally erase this part of your memory. I ask for your understanding.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">“Wait… Where is this?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Sun Lingtong blinked - and in that instant, the world around him shifted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Chilling mist rolled in all directions. He found himself standing on a war chariot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The chariot rumbled forward slowly, surrounded by dense ranks of ghost soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Sun Lingtong shook his head, quickly realizing: he had already been transported into the mobilized army. Whatever Luo Si had done took full effect - his memories of the journey erased without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">“Heheheh.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Seeing Sun Lingtong’s dazed expression, the Nascent Soul-level ghost cultivators on the war chariot burst into mocking laughter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">“Luo Si erased your memory. Clearly, you’re not exactly close to him.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">“Strutting around with a token, bragging like you own the place - guess you’re exposed now.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">“Truly pathetic… and laughable.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">The mockery was unrestrained.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Sun Lingtong blinked, puzzled. Why are they treating me with such disdain? What happened while I was unconscious? What did I say or do?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">He decided to stay observant and gather intelligence. With a cold snort, he said nothing and simply sat down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Every ghost cultivator on the chariot continued to mock him - except for one Nascent Soul ghost cultivator seated beside him, who remained silent the entire time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Sun Lingtong turned to ask him something, but the moment the words left his lips, another round of laughter erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">“Oh, now this is rich!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">“Seeking guidance from Lord Silent himself? Hahaha - after all your arrogance, now you grovel?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">“This is too good - hilarious!”</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
