<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 396: Ning Zuo Helps Lin Bufan Calm Down</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
"Master Lin, what do you mean?" Ning Jiufan was very confused.<br/>
<br/>
Just moments ago, Lin Bufan was actively treating Elder Ning, and they were exchanging occasional pleasant words in a harmonious atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly!<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan's expression changed, becoming severe towards Ning Jiufan, his tone dark and seemingly accusatory.<br/>
<br/>
What exactly had happened?<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan stared intently at Ning Jiufan's expression and couldn't help but clap his hands and sigh: "Impressive, truly impressive."<br/>
<br/>
"Fellow Daoist Ning, your acting skills are truly remarkable."<br/>
<br/>
"In my hundreds of years of cultivation, I've never seen someone perform so naturally, without any flaws."<br/>
<br/>
"Unfortunately, I've already seen through your plot to acquire the Linglong Mirror Wall."<br/>
<br/>
"Give up any hope. Even your clan's genius Ning Zuo, despite having a Nascent Soul-level mechanical dragon at his disposal, had to retreat from the formation within formations."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan: "Huh?"<br/>
<br/>
"Wait, wait!"<br/>
<br/>
"What's the Linglong Mirror Wall? And Ning Zuo? What trouble has that kid gotten into now?"<br/>
<br/>
"Master Lin, my clan's cooperation with your sect is completely sincere. Even if I had ulterior motives, I wouldn't place our only Nascent Soul-level fighting force in your hands, would I?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan spread his hands: "Look, I could have completely hidden Elder Yuan's injuries. Why would I needlessly reveal that?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan: ....<br/>
<br/>
He fell silent for a moment, his eye twitching slightly as he looked Ning Jiufan up and down again, and said: "You don't know about this?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan shook his head, saying plaintively: "This junior truly doesn't know what's happening."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan couldn't help but point at Ning Jiufan's nose: "You're the only Golden Core cultivator in the Ning family, yet you know nothing about this?!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's eye also twitched as he sighed: "Master Lin, you don't understand. That kid Ning Zuo is extremely clever and independent. Has he caused trouble again this time? I knew it - when he called me here, he must have had some scheme in mind!"<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh, he's still young, only sixteen years old."<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest, this junior is also extremely troubled by him. He's too young and acts recklessly. If he has offended your sect in any way, as his elder, I will take full responsibility."<br/>
<br/>
"Master Lin, our two sides have a long history of good relations. The Ning family absolutely has no intention of being hostile to your sect. Please understand this, Master!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan snorted coldly: "At this point, nothing you say matters."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Jiufan, surrender!"<br/>
<br/>
Hearing this, Ning Jiufan furrowed his brow, clenched his fists, and his aura suddenly rose.<br/>
<br/>
But in the next moment, Lin Bufan unleashed his Nascent Soul-level aura, completely suppressing him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan gritted his teeth: "Master Lin, you want a man of the North to surrender without a fight? This is too much!"<br/>
<br/>
As Lin Bufan was about to speak, Ning Jiufan raised his hand to cut him off and continued: "The Ning clan has good relations with your sect. If we were to form an alliance today, it could last for generations. How can we let a momentary misunderstanding turn our two families into enemies?"<br/>
<br/>
"I very much want to fight with all my strength, to live up to the name of being brave and martial. But as the only Golden Core of the Ning clan, I cannot act recklessly!"<br/>
<br/>
"Our clan's genius Ning Zuo is young and inexperienced, hot-blooded and reckless. Now that trouble has occurred, if I were to start another conflict, wouldn't that make things even worse?"<br/>
<br/>
"Alas, fate is difficult to defy, and one's path is full of hardships. To think we've reached this point today. The sorrow in my heart is difficult to suppress, for I know deeply that surrender is the only way to resolve this."<br/>
<br/>
"Very well, very well. Though Ning Jiufan wishes to fight to the death, for the sake of the clan, the bigger picture, and Elder Yuan's situation, I can only temporarily submit and let peace prevail. I hope Master Lin will remember our past friendship and be lenient with the Ning clan, not betraying our former good relations."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan: ....<br/>
<br/>
His eye twitched several times before he finally moved to restrain Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan indeed didn't resist, allowing himself to be captured.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan took a deep breath, his mood slightly improving: "At least you know what's good for you. It's just unfortunate that your clan's Ning Zuo was too clever and discovered my secret."<br/>
<br/>
"If you cooperate with me and bring Ning Zuo here, perhaps today's matter can be settled more leniently."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan quickly nodded: "I will write a flying message right away to summon that troublemaker Ning Zuo."<br/>
<br/>
"Additionally, I humbly request Master Lin to think thrice before deciding to strike a fatal blow against me or the Ning clan."<br/>
<br/>
"Though my Ning family migrated from the Northern Lands, we have already established a firm foothold in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. This year, we not only expanded by branching out but also secretly allied with the royal Zhu family."<br/>
<br/>
"To be honest, I hold an official position and have made secret agreements with the royal Zhu family. If Master Lin permits, I can produce the corresponding official seals as proof."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan's eyebrows shot up as he asked in surprise: "You're... an official?"<br/>
<br/>
As a Nascent Soul cultivator in his own long-established base, he naturally wasn't afraid of a mere Golden Core trying to turn the tables.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, Lin Bufan agreed to Ning Jiufan's request.<br/>
<br/>
Under his supervision, Ning Jiufan took out his official seals and documents for Lin Bufan to examine.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan: ....<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the official seals and documents in his hands, his eye couldn't help but twitch again.<br/>
<br/>
His disciples' intelligence gathering in this short time couldn't have uncovered the true political tensions in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Now seeing these official seals and documents, he suddenly understood that with the Ning family being so close to the royal family, Fire Persimmon Immortal City must be full of hidden intrigue!<br/>
<br/>
Moving against Ning Jiufan meant moving against a royal official.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, this official was particularly close to the Zhu family!<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan began to develop a headache.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile...<br/>
<br/>
Inside the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, Ning Zuo and Sun Lingtong silently gazed at the enormous misty formation covering four mountains and one valley.<br/>
<br/>
After a long while, Sun Lingtong sighed: "Lin Bufan has directly activated the mountain-protecting formation - he means to trap us here."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo nodded slightly, his expression grave: "This is roughly what I expected. Whatever is in the Ten Thousand Demons Cave, since it could benefit both Linghu Jiu and me so greatly, it's clearly of immense value."<br/>
<br/>
"Lin Bufan has schemed for many years, and despite being a Nascent Soul cultivator, he personally took the position of sect master and has controlled the Myriad Medicine Sect for many years. Clearly, he's someone who tends to want to control situations."<br/>
<br/>
"That's why he's acting this way."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong asked again: "What about your clan's Golden Core ancestor?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo had already sensed Ning Jiufan through the Life-Threading technique, and revealed a strange expression: "He's still alive."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong brightened: "This proves that Lin Bufan is still hesitating."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo smiled slightly: "After all, if he killed my clan's ancestor, it would greatly damage the Myriad Medicine Sect's reputation. Who would dare come here as guests then? Not to mention the herb business."<br/>
<br/>
"This foundation is Lin Bufan's achievement of many years. Unless he wants to take everything from the Ten Thousand Demons Cave and become a demonic cultivator, abandoning this massive enterprise."<br/>
<br/>
"The problem is, from the fact that I could receive guidance from the Five Elements Divine Lord, we can see he still can't take all the Ten Thousand Demons Cave's legacy."<br/>
<br/>
"Moreover, my clan's ancestor holds an official position. If Lin Bufan kills him, he'd be cutting himself off from the righteous path."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly: "So you're saying we don't need to fight Lin Bufan here? We can still negotiate?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo's expression became solemn: "Lin Bufan is a Nascent Soul cultivator, and this is his territory - the mountain-protecting formation is under his control. He's been established here for so many years!"<br/>
<br/>
"Fighting here, we have absolutely no chance of victory."<br/>
<br/>
"Besides, if it comes to fighting, that means the situation has already deteriorated."<br/>
<br/>
"We need to help him."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: "Huh? Now isn't the time to rescue the Ning family ancestor - he must be under Lin Bufan's control!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo smiled slightly at Sun Lingtong: "No, no, boss, you've misunderstood my meaning."<br/>
<br/>
"My clan's ancestor doesn't need help at all."<br/>
<br/>
"He's a hostage now, and that role is very important."<br/>
<br/>
"The one we need to help is Lin Bufan."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes widened in surprise: "Huh?"<br/>
<br/>
"Sect Master, why have you activated the entire mountain-protecting formation?" Some Golden Core elders of the sect arrived together.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan naturally wouldn't explain the situation. He didn't need to explain, just smiled and maintained a firm attitude: "Just follow my orders."<br/>
<br/>
Under his consecutive commands, the entire Myriad Medicine Sect mobilized. Countless cultivators began searching the valley for Ning Zuo.<br/>
<br/>
All sorts of magical tools, treasures, talismans, and more were also being used continuously, determined to find Ning Zuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's flying message stopped at the cave dwelling of Small Dispute Peak, unable to enter.<br/>
<br/>
However, Ning Zuo's flying message flew directly to Lin Bufan.<br/>
<br/>
"Your family's boy is truly audacious!" Lin Bufan read the message and his face immediately turned cold, his gaze sharp as a blade as he turned to Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan wore a bitter expression. He had already been completely controlled by Lin Bufan, with his storage belt and other items confiscated.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan showed him the message.<br/>
<br/>
After reading it, Ning Jiufan's expression became even more bitter.<br/>
<br/>
In the message, Ning Zuo claimed he had buried countless fire essences under the Ten Thousand Demons Cave, and with just a thought, he could trigger a massive explosion.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, he had placed numerous mechanisms in hidden corners throughout the Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, ready to spread information about the Ten Thousand Demons Cave's legacy to the world with just a lift of his finger.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo was thus threatening Lin Bufan to release Ning Jiufan immediately!<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zuo is being foolish!"<br/>
<br/>
"I'm at Lin Bufan's mercy now. He's a Nascent Soul cultivator - he has too many ways to control me!"<br/>
<br/>
"He should use the Ten Thousand Li Dragon to quickly leave this place of trouble, then report to the Zhu family and get reinforcements!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan screamed in his heart while outwardly criticizing Ning Zuo heavily, actively requesting to write another flying message to persuade him to surrender.<br/>
<br/>
If Lin Bufan could find Ning Zuo, he wouldn't have activated the mountain-protecting formation.<br/>
<br/>
Though he appeared strong, the situation was actually quite awkward for him.<br/>
<br/>
Before Ning Jiufan's message of surrender could fly out, Ning Zuo's second message arrived.<br/>
<br/>
This time, when Lin Bufan read it, he exploded in rage!<br/>
<br/>
"Insolent thief! This is too much!!" Lin Bufan slammed the table and stood up abruptly, his face full of fury, almost bursting with anger.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan's heart skipped a beat when he saw this. He quickly began loudly cursing Ning Zuo while indirectly trying to find out what Ning Zuo had done to cause such a huge misunderstanding with Lin Bufan!<br/>
<br/>
"Misunderstanding?!" Lin Bufan roared, "Your Ning Zuo has kidnapped my daughter, and you call this a misunderstanding?!"<br/>
<br/>
"What?!"<br/>
<br/>
"That scoundrel Ning Zuo is inhuman!"<br/>
<br/>
"If anything happens to my daughter, I, Lin Bufan, swear to slaughter your entire Ning clan!!"<br/>
<br/>
Actually, before giving the order to search the mountains, Lin Bufan had secretly ordered Lin Shanshan to relocate.<br/>
<br/>
However, Lin Shanshan had already been marked by Ning Zuo's Life-Threading technique. No matter which secret chamber she hid in, Ning Zuo could find her clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the secret chamber had defensive formations and concealment formations, but these defensive measures still couldn't stop the power of divine abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo then piloted the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, piercing through space to enter the secret chamber directly.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he suddenly appeared and quickly struck several points on Lin Shanshan's body to immobilize her.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Little Ju reacted, she was also immobilized.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo moved the master and servant into the mechanical dragon's cabin and quickly departed.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan and Little Ju were confined in the mechanical ship's cabin.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan wore a cold expression: "Young Master Ning, you have deceived Shanshan too deeply. What martial art was that just now, that could instantly immobilize me?"<br/>
<br/>
Of course it was the Life-Threading technique!<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zuo just smiled bitterly and bowed in apology: "That was the art of striking pressure points with fingertips. I've embarrassed Miss Lin."<br/>
<br/>
"This time, my actions are not betraying kindness with enmity. On the contrary, I came to help Miss Lin and your sect."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan's expression was icy, but she still said: "Speak."<br/>
<br/>
Little Ju screamed: "Young Miss, don't listen to him! The Sect Master suddenly activated the mountain-protecting formation and is searching everywhere for Ning Zuo - he must have done something bad. Now he's even kidnapped us. He's a villain!"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan was crying inside.<br/>
<br/>
She was just trying to stall for time - how else could she buy time for her father to come rescue them?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo sighed deeply: "Thank you, Miss Lin, for giving me a chance. Ah... there are reasons for everything. Let me explain the details to you, Miss Lin."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo then told them everything about the Ten Thousand Demons Cave, how he discovered the truth from the fake wine of Profound Thought Dark Brew, and then his experience exploring the formation within formations with Linghu Jiu.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan and Little Ju were silent for a long time, both shocked.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo bowed again in apology: "I absolutely did not intend to cause trouble with your sect."<br/>
<br/>
"I also never expected such a situation to arise."<br/>
<br/>
"But clearly, your sect master doesn't want to let us go and wants to keep this secret."<br/>
<br/>
"I completely understand, as such an opportunity is definitely not simple and is extremely valuable!"<br/>
<br/>
"I just want to save myself."<br/>
<br/>
"My clan's Golden Core ancestor is now being detained and confined by your sect master. I truly had no other choice but to come seek Miss Lin's help."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan and Little Ju looked at each other, both shocked and helpless at the complex and awkward situation before them.<br/>
<br/>
They understood Ning Zuo's position.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan's expression softened: "Young Master Ning, please understand the situation. Even with the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, you cannot escape."<br/>
<br/>
"Even if you can escape, you may escape the monk but not the temple. Unless your clan migrates long-distance from Fire Persimmon Immortal City again!"<br/>
<br/>
"Why not release me, and I'll go ask father to show mercy for you. If you trust me, I will arrange proper accommodation for you and your clan."<br/>
<br/>
"But if you persist in this course, you'll only compound error with error, leaving both sides no room to back down. The conflict will escalate, the situation will spiral out of control, and ultimately the Ning family will fall into the abyss."<br/>
<br/>
These words caused Ning Zuo to look at Lin Shanshan deeply.<br/>
<br/>
He clapped his hands and sighed: "Miss Lin truly deserves to be the young miss of the Myriad Medicine Sect. Now I see your brilliance."<br/>
<br/>
"However, Miss Lin seems to have misjudged the current situation."<br/>
<br/>
"I am only asking Miss Lin to help persuade your father to be more calm and not take a wrong step that he'll regret for life."<br/>
<br/>
"You must know that the Myriad Medicine Sect's foundation took him hundreds of years to create and develop - that was no easy feat. If it were lost because of this, wouldn't that be too much of a waste?"<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan raised her eyebrows, about to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Little Ju had already interrupted: "That sounds so nice! Since the Sect Master has already captured your ancestor, naturally that Nascent Soul-level demon ape has also been subdued and can't cause any waves."<br/>
<br/>
"Yet here you are making ominous predictions, still trying to deceive us?"<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, Young Miss, don't listen to him - he's just putting on a show!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zuo smiled slightly: "It seems Little Ju has misunderstood me. The situation is not in your sect master's hands at all. Just watch - our help is almost here."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Ning Zuo's confident expression and strategic demeanor, Lin Shanshan's heart skipped a beat as she asked: "Who is it?"<br/>
<br/>
Outside Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, Zhu Xuanji stroked his forehead and sighed: "Oh my, they really did activate the mountain-protecting formation. Such a huge display - could it be as Ning Zuo's message said?"</div>
