<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Sun Lingtong continuously flickered, using talismans to seal the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator and the Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Then, with a light leap, he arrived in front of Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He lifted Han Ming's head, his eyes gleaming with spiritual light, "Tell me, how did they find you? You were clearly imprisoned in the underground iron cell, how did you send out a distress signal?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Due to practicing the Immortal Zombie Transformation Technique, Han Ming could still cling to life for a while even with her head detached.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Her face was full of panic, "Don't kill me, I am a disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect. If you kill me, you will be marked with a Soul Imprint, and the Soul Devouring Sect will not spare you!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sun Lingtong sneered, his killing intent evident, "We are already mortal enemies, do you think I fear a mere Soul Imprint?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Han Ming screamed, "No, don't kill me. I'll tell you everything."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"But you cannot kill me! I have value, I can help you enhance the foundation of your soul!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Speak!" Sun Lingtong felt inexplicably irritated, he shouted impatiently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"I can tell you." Suddenly, a voice came from behind Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">In an instant, without thinking, he attempted to use the Void Traversing Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">But his body remained in place, motionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">"Why can I see my body from a distance?" The strange angle made Sun Lingtong extremely horrified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Realizing what had happened, he was shocked to find that his soul had been extracted from his body, held by the throat by a mysterious cultivator, suspended in mid-air!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Sun Lingtong turned his head and saw a tall, thin man with black hair, smiling at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The man was dressed in black robes, his hair disheveled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">He had no pupils, his eye sockets filled entirely with whites.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Sun Lingtong shivered, recalling some information from his memory, and blurted out the man's identity, "Blind Judge Qi Bai?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The black-robed man, Qi Bai, smiled faintly, his breath chilling, "You know me? That saves me some explanation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Inner disciple Han Ming greets the true disciple!" Han Ming was extremely excited, she hadn't expected reinforcements to arrive so quickly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">She had thought she was facing death, but unexpectedly found a way out!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sun Lingtong's body hung its head low, standing still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">His soul, held by Qi Bai, had become a prisoner, "Qi Bai, you are a dignified Golden Core Cultivator, a true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect. You, you had your eyes on Fire Persimmon Immortal City for a long time, which is why you appeared in time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Qi Bai smiled again, "You are very smart, that's good, I like talking to smart people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"That's right."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"Our Soul Devouring Sect has been secretly monitoring Fire Persimmon Mountain for a long time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Fire Persimmon Mountain was once a cursed land, plagued by countless volcanic eruptions that buried innumerable living beings. The eruptions brought forth spiritual energy, earth flames, and other heavenly treasures, as well as incredibly fertile soil, gradually attracting living beings to settle here. Then, on a certain day, the volcano would erupt again, turning the place into a slaughterhouse where billions of lives perished."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Do you think this is a meticulously planned murder by the heavens and earth against all living beings?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Qi Bai paused for a moment and continued, "From ancient times to the present, how many lives have perished in Fire Persimmon Mountain? Even if their souls were scattered, the remaining soul buds have accumulated, forming an immeasurable soul repository. Why do the Crimson Flame Beasts in Fire Persimmon Mountain appear endlessly? It's because the souls are refined by the earth flames, transforming into new seeds that bloom into life again in the form of demonic beasts. This should have been the blessed land of our Soul Devouring Sect, the best place for a branch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"Unfortunately, the Three Sects Elder left the Lava Immortal Palace here, and the Southern Bean Dynasty built an Immortal City. Most people focus on the Lava Immortal Palace, but our sect values the immeasurable soul repository hidden deep within Fire Persimmon Mountain even more." As Qi Bai said this, he looked up at the mountain with a mix of greed, curiosity, and desire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Han Ming couldn't help but cry out for help, "Lord Qi Bai, save me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">"Be patient." Qi Bai extended his finger and lightly hooked it, capturing the souls of the three defeated members of the Soul Devouring Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Sun Lingtong, seeing his effortless action, couldn't help but say, "As expected of the Blind Judge, you've truly mastered the Soul Capturing Technique to perfection, grasping the Divine Ability seed at the Golden Core Stage." If it were an ordinary magic technique, Sun Lingtong might still have a slim chance to escape using the Space Piercing Technique under Qi Bai's sneak attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">But the Soul Capturing Technique at the Divine Ability seed level made Sun Lingtong a prisoner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The souls of the three defeated members floated in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator and the Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator, realizing what had happened, were overjoyed and bowed to Qi Bai.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Qi Bai said, "Our sect is a great demonic sect. This time, the three of you joined forces but were defeated by one person. If this spreads, it will tarnish our sect's reputation. If I hadn't intervened in time, your deaths would have been certain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Now, tell me, where did you fail this time? If your explanation is reasonable, I will save your lives. If not, I will stand by and watch. If you die at the hands of others, the sect's laws won't trouble me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"I'll speak, I'll speak!" The Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator was the first to respond, "I was careless and didn't expect this Sun thief to have the ability to steal the power of the Immortal City Grand Formation. I had already examined the formation he set up in his courtyard; it seemed ordinary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"But this was a deliberate disguise. In reality, this small protective formation could connect to the Immortal City Grand Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"That's right. I set up the formation in the courtyard, and as time passed, it gradually activated the small formation, which indirectly triggered the grand formation. The Immortal City Grand Formation's immense power broke my formation from the outside in, causing me severe backlash." "Indeed," Qi Bai nodded, "Return."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">With a light word, the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator's soul returned to his body, and he woke up in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"I'll speak." The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator quickly responded, "We lost due to internal strife. If the three of us had worked together with one heart, we could have captured Sun Lingtong long ago. But because the two of us were dissatisfied with Han Ming's arrogance and stopped cooperating, we gave the enemy a chance to breathe."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Qi Bai nodded, "You didn't see the latter part of the battle and still underestimated Sun Lingtong's strength. However, what you said is also a reason for the defeat. Return." "Thank you, Lord!" The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator was overjoyed, and in the next moment, his soul returned to his body, and he got up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Han Ming, what do you think?" Qi Bai looked at Han Ming's soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"Despicable!!" Han Ming's soul harbored deep resentment, "This Qi Bai is merely using this as an opportunity to suppress me, forcing me to submit to him!" Han Ming saw through Qi Bai's intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">She was a proud person.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">At the same time, she was also pragmatic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">If she hadn't been rescued, she would have submitted to Chui Can Ke.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">After being saved, her first thought was to settle the score with Chui Can Ke!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Luck Field of the Mountain Watching Technique fully ignited Han Ming's vengeful mindset, making her disregard the inherent risks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Now, being interrogated by Qi Bai, she instantly realized she was being used as a pawn, a mere scout to probe the path ahead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Qi Bai intended to use this to coerce her into submission, to be used for his purposes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">"In essence, how is this different from how Chui Can Ke treated me?!" "Let them fight like dogs!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"One is an Immortal Talent, the other a Golden Core Cultivator, ha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Thinking of this, Han Ming feigned compliance: "I lost because I was too eager for revenge, causing my mindset to become unbalanced...."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">"Isn't it because your strength is insufficient?" Qi Bai interrupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Yes." Han Ming gritted her teeth and admitted, then proactively mentioned: as long as Qi Bai helped her avenge her grievances and killed Chui Can Ke, she would be willing to submit to Qi Bai for a hundred years and could sign a Soul Contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Qi Bai smiled, "You are quite clever."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">He indeed valued Han Ming; she possessed Talent, and even though it was only inferior Talent, taking her in as a subordinate still held considerable value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Afterwards, he released Han Wu's soul, reassembled her body, and provided some minor healing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Han Hao finally regained the ability to move freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Qi Bai looked at Sun Lingtong: "Speak, where is Chui Can Ke?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong tried to stall for time: "Didn't you just say you would tell me how Han Ming sought help?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"You still remember." Qi Bai smiled and explained the details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The issue lay with a batch of materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Han Wu had proactively mentioned the Soul Contract to Ning Zhuo, and crafting the Soul Contract required many key materials.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Among these materials were some rare items that were actually monopolized by the Soul Devouring Sect in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">After Han Ming was captured, Ning Zhuo began collecting the key materials for the Soul Contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">This procurement information spread out, immediately alerting and attracting the attention of the hidden forces of the Soul Devouring Sect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Coupled with Han Ming's disappearance, it was easy to deduce that she had been captured alive and urgently needed rescue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Don't forget, Qi Bai had always been secretly monitoring Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"So it was that simple." Sun Lingtong sighed deeply.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Oftentimes, simple and straightforward arrangements are more reliable than Magic Techniques or Magical Tools," Qi Bai said, "Now it's your turn to enlighten me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong shook her head and spread her hands: "We never agreed on that beforehand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"You refuse to cooperate?" Qi Bai felt a slight surprise, "You know me well. I have a title called the Blind Judge, and you are aware of this." Sun Lingtong replied, "Then go ahead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"The pain of Soul Searching is something you may not have experienced. It's beyond what ordinary people can imagine." Qi Bai sneered coldly, "Since you want to try it, I'll satisfy you!" He grasped Sun Lingtong's soul and entered the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He took out a seal, infused it with Spiritual Power, and tossed it into the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The seal floated in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Qi Bai performed a ritual, bowing to the seal, "I respectfully invite the Judge to investigate!" The seal erupted with a vast ghostly aura, quickly condensing into a massive figure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Summoning Technique—Investigative Judge!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The ghostly Judge, fierce and malevolent, sat cross-legged like a temple deity, looking down at Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Judge's eyes emitted lightning, piercing through Sun Lingtong's soul, wantonly scouring every inch of his memory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Sun Lingtong couldn't resist and instantly fell into a dark realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">When his younger self opened his eyes, he saw his master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">His master, full of love and pity, said to him, "Alas, you greedy child. By consuming the Ding Gu Pill, you can only cultivate the Child's Technique." The memory was abruptly pulled, as if an invisible hand forcibly traced back Sun Lingtong's memories.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Lingtong found himself in the Crimson Flame Demon Lava Cave, staring anxiously at a corner of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Master, Master, why haven't you come out yet?" The memory shifted again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The scene changed from Fire Persimmon Mountain to an alley in an Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Sun Lingtong, gravely injured and near death, lay on the ground, ignored by everyone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">A two-year-old child discovered him, cautiously approached, and then used all his strength to drag Sun Lingtong into his home.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The memory flashed again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Sun Lingtong was lying on a bed, weakly looking at his savior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">The two-year-old child was holding a bowl, offering it to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"You finally woke up. Drink this quickly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"This is the medicine I made for you; it will help you recover." Sun Lingtong's eyes were vacant, still processing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Little brother, what's your name?" "My name is Ning Zhuo."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Where does your family live? What are your parents' names? Do you still remember?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Sun Lingtong was moved to the core, subconsciously murmuring, "Master... Master..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Two-year-old Ning Zhuo immediately nodded, "Yes, yes, when you were unconscious, you kept calling for your master. Where is your master?" Sun Lingtong's eyes instantly reddened, "My master didn't come out... I need to find him and bring him back!" Saying this, he tried to get up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">But he was too weak, his hands unable to support him, and he fell back onto the bed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Two-year-old Ning Zhuo hurriedly stepped forward to support him, comforting in a childish voice, "Don't worry, don't worry. If you want to find your master, you can ask your family to do it. You should focus on recovering." Sun Lingtong, anxious, said, "My master is my only family in this world! Besides him, I have no other relatives." Two-year-old Ning Zhuo was stunned, deeply empathetic, and felt a strong surge of sympathy from the bottom of his heart!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">He choked up a bit and said, "I... I don't have any family either. Before I was born, my father died in battle. My mother also passed away not long ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Although I still have my uncle, he is very fierce, and I never felt he was my family." At this point, two-year-old Ning Zhuo's eyes quickly reddened, and his lips began to tremble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Sun Lingtong was stunned, feeling uneasy, "Please don't cry..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"Waah!" The next moment, thinking of his sorrow, two-year-old Ning Zhuo burst into tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Sun Lingtong stared, helpless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">He had been saved, but this savior... was a bit special.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
