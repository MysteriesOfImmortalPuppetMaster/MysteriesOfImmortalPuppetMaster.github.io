<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 364: Ning Zhuo vs. Chang Yan</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The next day, Lin Shanshan inquired again. Ning Zhuo informed her that he had already comprehended the first diagram and was currently studying the second one. Lin Shanshan was pleasantly surprised and immediately asked Ning Zhuo to demonstrate the spell he had learned. Ning Zhuo agreed. Upon witnessing the spell, Lin Shanshan was deeply moved. She remarked, "Ning Zhuo, I thought that you would’ve been lucky to comprehend a single diagram in the few days that you had. I had no idea your comprehension was this remarkable. I’ve truly underestimated you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Zhuo modestly responded, knowing that his exceptional progress was largely due to the Spirit Concealment Willow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Thanks to the Spirit Concealment Willow, Sun Lingtong also quickly comprehended all three diagrams, taking an hour less than Ning Zhuo. Sun Lingtong’s aptitude was extraordinary, and Ning Zhuo had recognized this long ago. Sun Lingtong's self-created sword techniques were exceptionally sharp, reflecting his outstanding talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">On the third day, Lin Shanshan asked again, and Ning Zhuo told her that he had successfully comprehended the "Listening to the Waves at Night in the Mountains" diagram. On the fourth day, when Lin Shanshan inquired again, Ning Zhuo confessed that he was stuck on the third diagram, "Peering at the Sky Beneath the Trees," finding its difficulty quite high. Lin Shanshan was amazed but reassured Ning Zhuo, explaining that since this diagram contained the most powerful spell, its difficulty was naturally much higher. She advised him to remain calm and not rush, noting that with the two spells he had already learned, he had more than enough advantage over Chang Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo, however, shook his head. "It's not enough!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Please don’t misunderstand, Miss Lin. I’ve decided to publicly declare that I won’t use the Oil Slick Talisman in my battle with Chang Yan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Puzzled, Lin Shanshan asked if this wasn’t unnecessarily tying his own hands. Ning Zhuo explained, "Although I have the protective talisman, I constantly remind myself not to rely too much on it. Becoming dependent on such external tools would dull my ambition and hinder my personal strength."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Don’t worry, I’m not being overly rigid. This trial on Little Contention Peak Peak is about training myself, not using external items to show off. What’s the point of relying on external powers to intimidate these fellow cultivators?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">After hearing this, Lin Shanshan's respect for Ning Zhuo deepened. "With such a disposition, Ning Zhuo, you’re bound for great achievements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Lin Shanshan sighed, recalling how she had seen many young cultivators at Ning Zhuo's age—boastful, arrogant, with their noses in the air—unlike Ning Zhuo’s humble and steady demeanor. "I look forward even more to your battle with Chang Yan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo smiled. "Win or lose, it doesn’t matter. If I lose to Chang Yan, please don’t think I’ve failed your teachings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"Teachings? Please, you're overpraising me," Lin Shanshan replied humbly. She believed that Ning Zhuo’s progress was mainly due to his own intelligence, talent, and hard work. However, Ning Zhuo felt that sparring with someone like Lin Shanshan, with her solid foundation and mastery of the basics, had been invaluable in helping him improve.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">A few days later, Ning Zhuo and Chang Yan appeared on the dueling grounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Chang Yan, dressed in yellow, stood at six feet tall. His transformation into human form was advanced, with only his amber, snake-like pupils remaining. In the cultivation world, monsters typically sought to transform into human form, as it greatly enhanced their spiritual abilities and cultivation potential. Therefore, the degree of transformation often indicated a monster's strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Chang Yan’s snake eyes reflected Ning Zhuo's figure as he spoke. "Ning Zhuo, I heard you’ve announced that you won’t use any protective talismans in this battle. Is that true?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo nodded, then shook his head. "In an emergency, I’ll naturally use the talisman to protect my life. But relying on a Golden Core talisman in our duel would be dishonorable. It wouldn’t help me hone my combat skills or advance my determination. So, if I end up using the Oil Slick Talisman in this battle or any future fight, I’ll consider myself defeated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The audience was shocked by this declaration. Some praised him: "I didn’t expect someone from a noble clan like Ning Zhuo to have such courage!" Others scoffed: "Talismans are part of one’s strength. Abandoning them is like tying your own hands—how foolish!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Lin Shanshan, hidden in the crowd, sneered at the critics, thinking, "How could any of you understand Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Chang Yan snorted in response to Ning Zhuo's words. "Since you’ve made such a decision, don’t regret it when you lose."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo smiled and gestured. "Please, go ahead."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The battle began. Chang Yan stomped his foot and instantly disappeared underground. His true form was that of a dirt snake, and burrowing through the earth was as natural as breathing to him. Typically, when facing an opponent who uses earth-burrowing techniques, cultivators would take to the air to avoid being ambushed. But Ning Zhuo didn’t do this. Instead, he muttered a spell, formed hand seals, then crouched and slammed his palms onto the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">**Wood Spell — Root and Vine Entanglement.**</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Chang Yan, burrowing swiftly underground, was about to reach Ning Zhuo's feet when a mass of roots and vines burst through the earth, fortifying the ground beneath Ning Zhuo. The roots surged toward Chang Yan, forcing him to evade. Although his earth movement was fast, he narrowly dodged the attack and quickly unleashed another earth spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">**Earthquake!**</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The ground of the dueling arena trembled violently. Invisible shockwaves radiated from the epicenter, targeting both Ning Zhuo and the roots beneath him. Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and unleashed his second prepared spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">**Wood Spell — Pine Wave and Emerald Surge.**</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">This was the spell Ning Zhuo had learned from the "Listening to the Waves at Night in the Mountains" diagram. In an instant, 50% of his magical energy surged forth, amplified by the cycle of the Five Elements. His power, initially fire, transformed into twice as much earth energy. Then, two portions of earth energy became four of metal energy, four metal portions turned into eight of water, and finally, eight water portions transformed into sixteen portions of wood energy. His initial magic now expanded to over six times its original amount!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The spell created massive waves of green energy, crashing in all directions. The emerald waves collided with the earthquake’s force, shaking the ground violently and tearing up the earth, creating deep cracks and raised mounds across the dueling field.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The two clashed with spells from afar. Ning Zhuo, only in the early Foundation Establishment stage, relied on his superior techniques and the transformation of the Five Elements to evenly match Chang Yan, who was in the late Foundation Establishment stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">But it wasn’t over yet!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo clapped his palms together in front of his chest and shouted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">**Wood Spell — Forest Domain!**</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Vines shot out from the ground, growing into massive trees that quickly formed an impenetrable forest cage. Within this giant forest, Chang Yan found himself trapped like an insect. Startled, he sensed the immense wood-element energy around him pressing in from all sides.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"He actually knows this spell!" Chang Yan exclaimed in shock. In this wood-formed prison, using earth spells would only strengthen his opponent. He had no choice but to resort to his magic weapons, using their sharpness to slash at the vines and cut down the trees. But no matter how many he destroyed, more trees grew back instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">If the dueling field had been larger, Ning Zhuo could have expanded the entire forest further. Chang Yan, as a lone demon cultivator without the backing of a major force, had only subpar magic weapons. These tools had little effect, unable to even get him close to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Chang Yan's expertise lay in earth spells, but Ning Zhuo had taken control of the battlefield from the start, leaving Chang Yan with no chance to turn the tide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"Damn it! If only I had acted first and used earth spells for a quick attack, it wouldn’t be this bad now!" Chang Yan held on a bit longer but finally, unable to continue, he admitted defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Thank you for the match," Ning Zhuo said politely as he leaped down from the treetops and saluted Chang Yan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Chang Yan's face twitched, but he forced himself to congratulate Ning Zhuo with a stiff smile before leaving the arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“We won!” Lin Shanshan clenched her fist in excitement. Although she already knew Ning Zhuo had mastered the three wood-element spells, witnessing his victory firsthand still felt almost unbelievable. The final spell, **Forest Domain**was especially difficult to master, yet Ning Zhuo had pulled it off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"Such talent!" Lin Shanshan marveled, "His understanding of wood spells is almost on par with our senior brother’s mastery of swordsmanship."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The onlookers were also buzzing with amazement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"I’ve never seen anyone actually use the **Forest Domain** before."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"That spell is incredible, but Ning Zhuo’s magic reserves are even more astonishing. He sustained it for so long without weakening."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"It was a clever strategy. By taking the initiative early on, he left Chang Yan with no room to counterattack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91"> Chang Yan, already disadvantaged by wood spells, lost his chance to seize the initiative."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The audience dissected the battle, with many noting how quickly it had ended. Most had expected a drawn-out fight, but Ning Zhuo's powerful wood spells brought it to a swift conclusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">"Ning Zhuo won Chang Yan’s cave, but this is far from over. Ning Zhuo is strong enough to contend for a spot in the top ten caves!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">As the crowd speculated about Ning Zhuo’s next challenge, he left the arena, walking alongside Lin Shanshan on a shaded path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Miss Lin, I’d like to ask for your help with something," Ning Zhuo said suddenly during their conversation. "It might be a bit difficult for you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
