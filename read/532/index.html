<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">At this moment, the Fire Crown Divine Fir was extremely aggrieved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">It had originally had victory in it’s grasp, but was successfully beaten in a chicken theft by Sun Lingtong, and it’s promising situation was directly ruined.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The reason this could happen in the first place was it’s public incense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">If the Fire Crown Divine Fir had been open and above board -erecting temples and absorbing incense offerings,  before the devotees offered incense -they would have recited its divine name. This way, the incense offerings would have belonged to the Fire Crown Divine Fir alone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">But all along, It had hidden It’s true form, and even the forest keeper Luo Chen, who guarded the Ten Li Burning Forest, was unaware of It’s existence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">It was not until the victory of the Three Generals’ Camp was in sight and Luo Chen’s intention to retreat became very obvious that the Fire Crown Divine Fir had to reveal itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The situation was very clear to it: once the Two Note Nation took control of this place, they would certainly carry out strict inspections, and It would no longer be able to hide.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"My incense!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">"Luo Chen, you must seize my incense back, or else we will all lose!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Luo Chen: “Pfft!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">He spat out fresh blood and immediately became listless, his momentum and fighting spirit plunging to rock bottom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">His face turned extremely pale, wearing the expression of a corpse: “Where is the incense? Who stole it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The Fire Crown Divine Fir: “I don’t know!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Luo Chen: “Pfft!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He spat out another mouthful of fresh blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">With the Fire Crown retracted, the three generals -Liu, Guan, and Zhang -also staggered, and for a moment were unable to launch a killing attack, having to urgently adjust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">At this moment, however, the ordinary soldiers recovered somewhat faster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo, in accordance with the actual situation, mobilized military strength and empowered his own spiritual arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">In an instant, Metal Path spells were cast, and knives, spears, swords, and so on, launched an assault like a torrential storm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Gao Cuo, eager to act, said: “Old Sword, shall we make our move?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Old Sword: “Wait a little longer! You and the Fire Crown Divine Fir and Luo Chen are all allies, with divine mandate in your possession; if you rashly strike against your own, you won’t be able to remain in the current Thousand Peaks Forest.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“Temporarily endure, that is the proper strategy!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Gao Cuo nodded: “Understood. Let the Three Generals’ Camp kill the Fire Crown Divine Fir, and then we can make our move to seize the wood fire.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">His main purpose in coming here had always been this rare fire seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">However, while they were communicating, Ning Zhuo was also communicating with Lin Bufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Sect Leader Lin, next it is up to you to act and seize the wood fire!” Ning Zhuo transmitted his divine sense and communicated with Lin Bufan through the token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ever since the Ning family, the Myriad Medicine Sect, and the Zhu family of the Southern Bean Kingdom had secretly forged an alliance through the Linyang Mirror Wall, these principal members all possessed each other’s tokens, enabling communication within a short distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Lin Bufan, upon realizing that he had been seen through by Ning Zhuo, was not surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">This was because earlier, when he had sought out Ning Zhuo, he had employed the One-Leaf Obscuring Technique, which had been seen through by Sun Lingtong using the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“Alright, I’ll cooperate with you,” Lin Bufan said quite decisively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In the next moment, Ning Zhuo intensified his fierce attack, aiming to create an opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">All three generals possessed Golden Core cultivation and recovered faster than Luo Chen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Zhang Hei was the first to act, directly hurling out the Black Snake Spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Spear technique -Snake Fang Throw!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The Black Snake Spear, with tremendous force, broke through the air and reached Luo Chen in the blink of an eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Luo Chen wanted to dodge, but then Guan Hong immediately acted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Talent -Purple-beard Astonishing Hong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Although it was not of divine ability level, Guan Hong had expended great effort in developing this talent, and its power was sufficient to counterbalance Luo Chen’s drastically declining state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Although it only immobilized him for an instant, it was enough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The Black Snake Spear directly pierced through Luo Chen’s chest, creating a huge hole, about the size of a basin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Luo Chen’s heart, lungs, as well as his spine, ribs, and so on, were all destroyed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">With his physical body dead, Luo Chen let out a lament and quickly retreated with his Nascent Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Liu Er immediately followed, brandishing the Xuanhuang Sword, and charged toward the Nascent Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Traversing the void!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Luo Chen’s Nascent Soul did not hesitate in the slightest; it immediately retreated into the void, directly leaving the battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“No, no, no!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“Luo Chen, you cannot escape!!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The Fire Crown Divine Fir roared in despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Without Luo Chen and without the public incense, even though It was a deity, It was equivalent to a bow without arrows, a cannon without ammunition, a martial artist without strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">It could only be at the mercy of others!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">The Three Generals’ Camp encircled the Fire Crown Divine Fir, bringing upon it the darkest despair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">With all sorts of attacks falling upon the Fir, relying solely on It's innate cultivation, It could still hold on for a little while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Zhuo had already finished communicating with the three generals -Liu, Guan, and Zhang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The assault suddenly grew wildly violent, causing the Fire Crown Divine Fir to teeter on the brink of collapse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">In the next moment, Lin Bufan, who had long been preparing, suddenly acted, cleaving the trunk of the Fire Crown Divine Fir and taking away the wood fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The three generals all roared in astonishment and anger; Guan and Zhang even intended to pursue and kill Lin Bufan, but were simultaneously halted by Liu Er and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“It’s just a trivial fire seed; if we lose it, so be it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Hold this place secure.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“If we can capture the Ten Li Burning Forest, that will be a great achievement. Do not let extraneous matters arise!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“That’s right, lest it be a ruse!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Gao Cuo and Old Sword: ??!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">“No, are you four all useless? With the spoils right in front of us, the fire seed has been snatched away by someone!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“Since it’s been snatched away, why not go after it?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Gao Cuo and Old Sword both felt that there was still some time before they needed to act. They were patiently waiting, but then the three generals launched a fierce simultaneous attack, briefly catching their breath, which allowed Lin Bufan to “seize” a good opportunity and, in front of everyone, snatch away the wood fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Let’s hurry and pursue! If we delay any longer, this fellow will run far away!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Old Sword’s inner cry in Gao Cuo’s heart clearly agitated him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The two stealthily snuck out, relentlessly chasing Lin Bufan who was darting in the high sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Gao Cuo specialized in the Book of Shapeless Shifting Shadows, being extremely skilled in disguising and concealing himself. Lin Bufan, though trailed all the way, did not notice him in the slightest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“This wood fire, worthy of being one of the Samadhi, indeed possesses profound mystery.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Having been the sect leader for many years, it was also the first time that Lin Bufan had encountered such an excellent fire seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">“Samadhi True Fire correspondingly illuminates the three talents of Heaven, Earth, and Man; the wood fire is the fire of kindling, that is, human fire.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“In the Ten Li Burning Forest, using human fire as the fire seed, ostensibly various magical implements were refined, but in reality, it was by gathering multitudinous incense offerings that the Fire Crown Divine Fir was refined.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">“This must have been the layout of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King; indeed, it was profound. Alas, being unable to contend head-on with the vast army of Two Note Country, such a strategy was abandoned halfway.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Lin Bufan, possessing his own vision and perspective, even in merely observing the battle today, could catch a glimpse of some of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King’s plans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">“Once the wood fire is refined by the Fire Crown Divine Fir, that divine fir would undoubtedly be detained first and would not lose its life. Therefore, this fire seed has always belonged to someone. Even though I have snatched it away, I must refine it further before handing it over to Ning Zhuo.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Lin Bufan pondered in secret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">According to the agreement he had just reached on the battlefield with Ning Zhuo through a conspiracy of divine sense,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Lin Bufan helped Ning Zhuo seize the wood fire, and in return, Ning Zhuo would reward Lin Bufan in other aspects of their cooperation afterward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">According to the alliance between the Myriad Medicine Sect and the Ning family, although it was not mentioned in the battlefield conspiracy, Lin Bufan proactively helped Ning Zhuo refine the fire seed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">One order after another was quickly issued by Liu Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Luo Chen was defeated and fled, with only his Nascent Soul surviving.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">The great craftsman Yan Jin was captured, another subordinate -the Flowing Flame Fairy died in battle, and the Great Forest Protection Formation all fell into the hands of the Three Generals’ Camp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Fire Crown Divine Fir was heavily sealed and strictly guarded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Thus, the battle came to an end, with the Three Generals’ Camp emerging as the victors, having paid the price of over three hundred casualties among their soldiers, and they fully took over the Ten Li Burning Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The victorious dispatch was also sent out at the first opportunity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The work had begun!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo slipped into his own camp tent, then entered the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, activating the three main mechanical platform pedestals to quickly replenish the mechanical puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">In this battle, his mechanical army also suffered heavy losses. Had he not replenished them midway, his entire army would have been wiped out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">One mechanical puppet after another was swiftly manufactured.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">By now, Ning Zhuo had become increasingly adept at this, and as a result, both the production and efficiency had seen slight improvements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The degree of improvement was not very great.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The true source of a significant increase in efficiency would have to be the mechanical platform pedestals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"That storage bag should contain other mechanical platform pedestals. Unfortunately, they cannot be opened at the moment," Ning Zhuo thought of Ingenious Princess Shuang Ling’s military supplies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">With troops in hand, his heart was calm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">As the mechanical puppets were replenished in increasing numbers, Ning Zhuo became more and more composed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">During the break, he reviewed this expedition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Nascent Souls can retreat into the void; Nascent Soul cultivators are very difficult to be completely killed. Mu Lan’s case was ultimately an exception."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"In the end, my limits have still not been tested. Enough."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"The Ten Li Burning Forest, the Cloud Shoulder Dragon Worship Terrace, the Gnarled Root Hundred Herbs Cave, the Thousand Vines Talisman Heavenly Corridor, and so on, were resource strongholds built around the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"According to the intelligence, these strongholds were jointly constructed and funded by the Dragon King Temple and the other major forces of the Thousand Peaks Forest. Each one came at a high cost!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"I did not expect that the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King had secretly played this trick, covertly supporting the Fire Crown Divine Fir to become a deity. He not only used the Ten Li Burning Forest to forge a deity, but also utilized the deity to covertly erode this stronghold in return. What a clever plan!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"However, it is precisely because of this that there exists public incense, that this fatal flaw emerged!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">For more than a decade, Ning Zhuo had been pondering the situation and forces in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and his insights on this matter were very profound.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Just like Lin Bufan, he too had gleaned a glimpse of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King’s scheme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Thinking of this, he patted his chest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"I designed the Five-Vital-Organs Temple Divine Spirit Technique, and I did not expect that it could be used here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Now, his Fire Path Heart Temple was filled with an enormous amount of incense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">During the battle, Ning Zhuo had secretly entrusted his own heart to Sun Lingtong, asking him to go out and steal incense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Such incense offerings could only be collected by a deity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Moreover, the Fire Crown Divine Fir belonged to the Fire Path and matched Ning Zhuo’s Fire Path Heart Temple perfectly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">If it were someone else, without the marvelous divine technique of Ning Zhuo by their side, even if they had discovered this major flaw of the Fire Crown Divine Fir, they would not have been able to take advantage of it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"Old Dice, you should also be able to make use of this incense, right?" Ning Zhuo flicked his wrist, shaking off his bracelet, and summoned the Dice Bone Demon God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Dice Bone Demon God immediately half-kneeled on the ground: "This old slave pays respect to his master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Master, your divine sight is infallible; these incense offerings, since they are public and ownerless, are perfectly suited for me to use in restoring myself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"However……"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Ning Zhuo: "However, what?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The Dice Bone Demon God continued: "However, my method and that of refining artifacts differ quite significantly. Although these public incense offerings can be absorbed by me and transformed into divine power, their rate of loss is much higher than that of the Fire Crown Divine Fir."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Ning Zhuo waved his hand and said magnanimously: "No matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The Dice Bone Demon God was immediately moved to tears of gratitude, praising Ning Zhuo’s generosity and benevolence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Ning Zhuo just observed from the side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">It was the first time he had ever seen a deity personally making use of incense offerings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Although he was well-read, his books did not cover this secret matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Ning Zhuo first released the Fire Path Heart Temple, letting it fall into the ship’s cabin, shrinking it to the size of a niche.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Dice Bone Demon God’s sitting posture was quite peculiar; He was not sitting cross-legged, but rather half-squatting, leaning his body forward, with both palms pressed against the floor of the ship’s cabin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The small temple opened its doors, revealing the incense offerings within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">The incense offerings gathered into a whole; overall, it was a flame with an unusual appearance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">At the very outer edge of the flame, there was continuously drifting gray smoke. The flame itself was divided into two layers: the outermost layer was bright red, and the middle layer was a golden amber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The Dice Bone Demon God took a deep breath, drawing the incense into his mouth and nostrils.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">He quickly refined it, transforming it into new divine power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Each surge of divine power was rapidly digested, forming into divine techniques that healed himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Ning Zhuo observed some clues: “Although deities are powerful, they need to consume incense offerings and refine them into their own divine power. With divine power, everything is the foundation for performing many divine techniques.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">“Dice Bone Demon God is severely injured and requires a large amount of divine power for healing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">“His Daoist realm has been seized, and although his devotees are still alive, they have been following me, so the incense offerings they accumulated have not had the chance to be utilized.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">“This is why deities often need to have devotees, need to have doctrines, and reside in a secluded place.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">“Could it be that deities themselves have no means to increase their own divine power?” Ning Zhuo, thinking of this, directly inquired of the Dice Bone Demon God.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">The Dice Bone Demon God answered: “Indeed, there are methods, but compared to absorbing and transforming incense offerings, their efficiency is far too poor.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">For deities, converting incense offerings into divine power was the true path.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Many deities still retained a physical body, such as some demon cultivators. They tried to convert demonic power and spiritual power into divine power, but in terms of efficiency and results, it far lagged behind that of incense offerings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">The Dice Bone Demon God then explained incense offerings to Ning Zhuo: “Master, public incense offerings have only two layers, but most incense offerings -those that are personal -have three layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">“The outermost red dust shell precipitates the boundless desires of the devotees.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">“The middle is the layer of wish power, the power of prayers and supplications.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">“At the very core is the divine nature nucleus, which is often inscribed with the divine name of a certain deity in the form of divine script.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">“Once the incense offering has a divine name, it becomes something that belongs to a master. Other deities would find it very difficult to use it, unless the original master lends it out.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">Finally, the Dice Bone Demon God looked deeply at the Fire Path Heart Temple: “Master, according to this marvelous technique of yours, perhaps you too can absorb incense offerings and convert them into divine power.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">“Oh?” Ning Zhuo immediately became interested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">But the Dice Bone Demon God added: “However, if you choose to follow the path of deities, there are many drawbacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">“Master, your future is already bright; I, your old slave, do not advise you to follow this path.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">Ning Zhuo nodded; he had also realized this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">Not to mention the rest, if he were to cultivate divine power, it would be a case of dual cultivation. The disadvantages of dual cultivation were numerous, and since he was currently cultivating all three dantian simultaneously, it had already greatly hampered his progress; pursuing divine power in addition would be entirely counterproductive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">The Dice Bone Demon God eventually absorbed most of the incense offerings, restoring himself to his original state.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Ning Zhuo continued to cultivate his physical body while waiting for Lin Bufan to return to him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="303">He was quite looking forward to the wood fire.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="305">In the end, after waiting for three days, he did not get Lin Bufan, but instead received an envoy from the military supervisor Zhao Xi, along with a reply.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
