<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo put more strength into it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Whoosh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">One of the indigo diamonds suddenly shot out and struck the copper wall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">There was a thin thread connecting the diamond and the ring. Ning Zhuo fiddled with it and found that although it was extremely thin, it was also incredibly tough.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He then walked over to the wall and carefully observed the diamond that had shot out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He expected the diamond to have pierced the wall like a nail. But in the end, he found that it had actually fused into the wall itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The part that was touching the wall had turned completely into copper, with the previous indigo glow now found only in the spot where it connected to the thin thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">It was as if it had been part of the wall from the very beginning. There was just a tiny bump sticking out where the thread connecting it to the hanging ring was attached.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“Incredible! How did it do that?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Was it talisman runes? A micro-formation? Or is the material of the diamond itself special?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo’s researcher’s heart was touched. He wished he could disassemble the hanging ring on the spot and study it for three days and three nights.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">“What a pity, it’s not the time for that!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo knew that exploration was his top priority for now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Holding the hanging ring, he looked down at his body, but couldn’t find a suitable place to put it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">His puppet body’s hands and feet were skinnier than the ring, and his arms and legs were the same.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo didn’t intend to hold the hanging ring directly in his hand. When going through Room 2, he needed to keep both hands free; it would be very inconvenient if one hand was occupied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">But this problem wasn’t a difficult one. Before long, Ning Zhuo thought of a solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">First, he pulled off his head. Then, he put the hanging ring on top of his neck, and finally attached his head again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Like this, his big head tightly locked the hanging ring in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">After installing the hanging ring, Ning Zhuo pushed the door open and officially entered Room 2.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The door swung shut behind him with a heavy thud. Ning Zhuo pushed it, but it didn’t move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Looking at the familiar hallway, Ning Zhuo didn’t rush to run through. Instead, he practiced with the hanging ring for a while.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">After reaching a certain level of proficiency, he started his attempts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Bang, bang, bang…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo was sent back to the start repeatedly. Unlike last time, his mentality was very stable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">A while later…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Zhuo sprinted to the middle of the hallway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Two giant logs swung toward him one after another. Ning Zhuo had just jumped into the air, leaving him unable to avoid them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">But it didn’t matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"I have a hanging ring!" Ning Zhuo thought to himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The wooden ring stuck under his big head suddenly shot out a diamond, which embedded itself in the ceiling with a crisp noise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">The thread connecting the ring to the diamond was very tough, causing Ning Zhuo’s neck to tilt as he was suspended in the air. The giant logs passed harmlessly below him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Another giant log fell from the ceiling toward him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Zhuo stopped the infusion of magical power, and the thread instantly snapped, breaking the connection between the wooden ring and the diamond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He dropped down to dodge then shot out another diamond into the giant log that passed above his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">When the log retracted, it brought him away with it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Just like that, with Ning Zhuo’s head tilting from time to time like a man at the gallows, he successfully passed Room 2 and arrived at the second door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">“No wonder it’s called the hanging ring. It’s a well-chosen name, perfectly fitting and to the point[^1].” Ning Zhuo sighed internally, stretching out his hands and straightening his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Thanks to the hanging ring, Room 2 had become much easier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Right now, Ning Zhuo was still in good shape. He only had a slightly cracked left leg and a single broken finger on his right hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">This was completely different from his miserable state during his first exploration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“What if I had chosen the hanging ring last time?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo thought about it and slightly shook his head. “It wouldn’t have worked.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Using the hanging ring required consuming spirit power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Had he chosen the hanging ring in his first exploration, Ning Zhuo’s spirit power would have been quickly exhausted, leaving him unable to move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo touched the second door. The message listing the rewards appeared in his mind: Two spirit stones, a mechanical component called the glass throwing knife, and a spell called the Fiery Grasp Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Last time, Ning Zhuo’s soul was already at its limit, so he hadn’t had the chance to look carefully and hastily picked the spell.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Now, he was in good condition and could calmly choose.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“The number of rewarded spirit stones has increased to two.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">“The glass throwing knife should be an offensive mechanical component.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">“The Fiery Grasp Art… seems to be similar to the Icy Embrace Art.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Right now, Ning Zhuo’s spirit stone only had 30% of its power left. He had no choice but to pick the first reward of two spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">After looking back at Room 2, he pushed the door open and entered Room 3.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">A message came – defeat the kung fu puppet, pass through Room 3, and enter the maintenance room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Not Room 4?” Ning Zhuo grew thoughtful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Room 3 was circular, and the edges were dark with the brightest light illuminating the center.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">“It’s like an arena.” Ning Zhuo immediately saw a tall and thin wooden puppet standing in the center of the room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">The puppet was yellow, with black lines on its skin. Inscribed on its chest were two words: Kung Fu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sensing Ning Zhuo, the puppet’s eyes suddenly lit up with yellow light. It stretched out its thumb and rubbed its wooden nose, then slowly bent down and made a halfway bow. Then, it stretched one hand out in front of it and placed the other hand behind its back, taking a stance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">It beckoned with its palm, as if telling Ning Zhuo to attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Interesting.” Ning Zhuo smiled. “I did learn some kung fu in the academy.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He had just obtained two spirit stones, so he wasn’t afraid of running out of power. Moreover, he was determined to gather more information, so he immediately stepped forward and started fighting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">A dozen breaths of time later, Ning Zhuo’s puppet body was almost broken into pieces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“I can’t beat this thing. There’s too big of a gap!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Zhuo suddenly hugged his opponent’s waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The enemy puppet immediately struggled, striking Ning Zhuo’s back and head with its fists and elbows.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Banging sounds rained down like a storm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo frantically urged his spirit power and unleashed his trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Spell —— Icy Embrace Art!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Crack…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Faint cracking sounds echoed out, and the enemy puppet’s body was gradually covered in ice, sealing its movement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">“I wouldn’t be able to pass this level if not for the Icy Embrace Art.” Ning Zhuo tried to destroy the kung fu puppet, but received a warning and was forced to stop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Squatting down, he launched a series of fist strikes on the puppet’s head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The layer of ice was broken, revealing the still-shining yellow eyes on the puppet’s head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo tried removing the eyes, but got the same message – destruction of the kung fu puppet was not allowed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The rewards from reaching the third door still numbered three.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Ten spirit stones, a mechanical component called the little flying box, and a spell called the Wood Grafting Art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">In the previous battle, Ning Zhuo had used up a lot of spirit power to trigger the Icy Embrace Art. Thus, to be safe, he chose the ten spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He pushed the door open and entered the maintenance room.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The so-called maintenance room was very spacious, much larger than the first three rooms. In the very center of the room was a five-sided stone pillar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">On one side of the stone pillar, there were the following words:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Qi Refining List.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">First Place: Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Zhuo was speechless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">The stone pillar rotated with a click, revealing another side:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Test Progress List.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">First Place: Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">There was no one below him. He was the only one on the list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Zhuo tilted his head in confusion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">After a few breaths of time, Ning Zhuo seemed to be struck by lightning. His body and mind trembled violently as he realized the full severity of this issue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">"Oh no!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">“I… I’m going to be exposed!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Notes:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">[^1]: The “hanging” in “hanging ring” refers to that kind of hanging. You know, the execution method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
