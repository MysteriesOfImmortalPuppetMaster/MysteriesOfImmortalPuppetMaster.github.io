<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 556: Ning Zhuo vs Xiang Yue!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo looked up and saw Xiang Yue looking down at him, the latter’s body robust, like a mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
A strong wind suddenly arose!<br/>
<br/>
Facing Ning Zhuo, Xiang Yue was naturally unceremonious, his arm sweeping out casually.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Ning Zhuo felt the world darken, as Xiang Yue’s robust arm descended with overwhelming force, in an unstoppable manner, as if to sweep away everything.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hurriedly activated the mechanical dolls and arranged them right in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
Clatter!<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue swung his arm horizontally, sweeping all the mechanical dolls into countless fragments, demolishing them effortlessly!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo retreated with difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue took a fierce forward step, shaking the nearby ground.<br/>
<br/>
He extended his left hand, spreading his five fingers, and from above to below, covered Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Art - Hand Covering the Sky!<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, Ning Zhuo’s pupils contracted sharply to the size of a needle tip.<br/>
<br/>
It felt as if the sky had darkened, and Xiang Yue’s palm enlarged infinitely in his eyes, leaving him with nowhere to hide, no way to evade, all resistance was futile!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood dumbfounded in place.<br/>
<br/>
“Do not harm my military advisor!!!” At the critical moment, Zhang Hei roared, disregarding life and death, and rushed to Ning Zhuo’s side.<br/>
<br/>
His voice thundered like exploding thunder, roaring in Ning Zhuo’s ear, waking him from his stupor.<br/>
<br/>
“Is this what it feels like to face Xiang Yue head-on?!”<br/>
<br/>
“What kind of pressure is this!”<br/>
<br/>
This was something that bystanders could not possibly feel.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt suffocated for a moment, his entire being was intimidated, and Zhang Hei’s roar seemed to awaken him from a nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
If it were not for this, he feared he would meet with misfortune!<br/>
<br/>
Boom.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei raised the Black Snake Spear, executing military tactics, and forcibly resisted Xiang Yue’s martial art, Hand Covering the Sky.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue snatched the Black Snake Spear, and in the process swung his arm horizontally, striking Zhang Hei at the waist, directly sweeping him away.<br/>
<br/>
Not only had Zhang Hei lost his weapon, but while in midair, he sprayed blood uncontrollably. The ribs on one side were completely shattered, and even his lumbar vertebrae suffered large cracks.<br/>
<br/>
Bang.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei was flung onto the ground in various directions, leaving behind a trail of blood. As tough as he was, for a moment he could not stand up.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er rushed to his side, and immediately used talismans to treat him.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue held the Black Snake Spear with both hands, and in the next moment, his arms exerted force, muscles bulging like blocks, and with his immense power, he actually bent the Black Snake Spear, folding it in half.<br/>
<br/>
His own weapon severely damaged, Zhang Hei was again counterattacked, experiencing pain in body and mind, and spitting out a small mouthful of blood.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue casually discarded the Black Snake Spear and once again charged towards Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
He executed martial arts with enormous strides, immediately shortening the distance between him and Ning Zhuo once again.<br/>
<br/>
Talent - Purple-bearded Astonishing Phoenix!<br/>
<br/>
Guan Hong’s red beard, as red as blood, now emitted a purple hue, restraining Xiang Yue, halting him for an instant.<br/>
<br/>
Only then did Ning Zhuo truly create distance, achieving temporary safety.<br/>
<br/>
After creating distance, he felt like a fish that had come ashore and fallen into water, experiencing a sense of renewed freedom.<br/>
<br/>
“Military Advisor, be careful! Do not get too close to Xiang Yue. He has been maintaining the Uninterrupted Stance!” Guan Hong transmitted his mental message.<br/>
<br/>
The several exchanges that just appeared to be long were in fact close combat with extremely high frequency, with every second counting; at this point, Guan Hong finally had the opportunity to communicate with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Art - Uninterrupted Stance!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred, and he immediately understood.<br/>
<br/>
Once this martial art was executed, it allowed the cultivator’s every move to carry a powerful aura, exerting tremendous pressure on the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang, the three generals, were okay, after all, they were of the Golden Core stage.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo’s combat power was of the Golden Core stage, in essence he was still a Foundation Establishment cultivator, thus there existed a spiritual gap.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, his performance was rather embarrassing.<br/>
<br/>
“The Elephant King had previously executed the martial art of Breaking the Army Stance, and now is using the Uninterrupted Stance. <br/>
<br/>
In that case, he belongs to the ‘Stance’ school of martial arts,” Sun Lingtong reminded Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, and with a thought, he sent Yuan Dasheng and Nightblade Shadow to attack.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Guan Hong also took the opportunity to wield the repaired Blood Dragon Blade and charged towards Xiang Yue.<br/>
<br/>
The two Golden Core mechanical war dolls, in coordination with Guan Hong, encircled Xiang Yue.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue remained unmoved, only attacking without defending, letting all sorts of assaults fall upon him.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Arts - Immovable Stance!<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue’s defense was extraordinarily astonishing! Even with the Blood Dragon Blade’s swordsmanship combined with military tactics, it could only create some knife slashes on him.<br/>
<br/>
After Nightblade Shadow’s Ghostly Execution Claw jabbed a few times, they all broke, only piercing Xiang Yue’s skin.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue swung horizontally and struck forcefully, a shoulder collision, directly knocking down the heavily armored Blood Ape Dasheng. The heavily armored body of Yuan Dasheng, as tall as a three-story building, suffered severe deformation.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue stepped down with one foot.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Art - Foot Splitting the Earth!<br/>
<br/>
Boom.<br/>
<br/>
He stomped heavily, directly crushing Yuan Dasheng’s chest, causing this mechanical war doll to be scrapped on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Almost at the same time, every hair on Ning Zhuo’s body stood on end, and his spiritual energy surged sharply.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo!” Sun Lingtong whispered, his eyes filled with worry.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo exhaled a mouthful of foul air; in just a moment earlier his whole body had broken into a sweat, and now sweat was steaming, with vapor surrounding him, seeping out through the gaps in his Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor.<br/>
<br/>
“I’m fine! Boss, rest assured.” Ning Zhuo quickly scanned his entire body with his divine sense, and after finding no issues, he became very invigorated.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that this time, he had counted Yuan Dasheng and Nightblade Shadow within the scope of the Military Tactics of the Hero's Return Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng was different from ordinary mechanical dolls and mechanical Golden Swallows; its own combat power was considerable. Only in the face of Xiang Yue, it was suppressed and it's potential went unrealized.<br/>
<br/>
With Yuan Dasheng destroyed, Ning Zhuo’s combat power immediately soared by a large margin!<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue then threw two more punches, repelling Nightblade Shadow and Guan Hong.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo did not dare to approach lightly, and only used the Five Elements Spell and other ranged attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er assisted Zhang Hei, and after seeing that he had gained the ability to protect himself and could heal independently, he immediately withdrew to join the battle.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Hei took some potent medicine in succession, forcibly healing as much as he could, and then, unable to delay any longer, reentered the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
After several days, Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning joined forces once more to engage in fierce combat.<br/>
<br/>
Their tacit understanding had long been developed; when coordinating together, not only were they intimately connected, but their actions flowed like clouds and water.<br/>
<br/>
But their enemy this time was truly too powerful!<br/>
<br/>
The contemporary Elephant King - Xiang Yue.<br/>
<br/>
His original form was that of a pale brute elephant, with an extraordinarily robust racial ferocity, and with divine abilities by his side, his martial arts mastery was magnificently formidable.<br/>
<br/>
Although the four of Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning were numerous, they were completely at a disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, someone would be blasted away, spitting blood incessantly, and after emergency healing, they hurriedly rejoined the battle.<br/>
<br/>
The main body of the Three Generals’ Battalion had shrunk to the rear, defending with an iron bucket formation. They focused on providing military support to the three generals, and did not dare to approach the combat group at all.<br/>
<br/>
Crack!<br/>
<br/>
The Blood Dragon Blade in Guan Hong’s hand, due to constantly blocking Xiang Yue’s fists and kicks, eventually gave out, disintegrating once again, leaving only the hilt clutched in Guan Hong’s hand.<br/>
<br/>
Liu Er’s Xuan Huang Sword was also severely deformed, making it obvious that this sword could not hold out for much longer.<br/>
<br/>
“This is bad, if it goes on like this, the three generals will all fall into the awkward situation of being unarmed,” Ning Zhuo worried incessantly.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, Xiang Yue seized the opportunity of battle and grabbed Nightblade Shadow’s right calf.<br/>
<br/>
His other hand immediately stretched out, directly grabbing Nightblade Shadow’s left arm.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue shouted sharply and unleashed a terrifying force, actually tearing the Ghostly Shadow Blade – Night Tiger – into two pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Although Nightblade Shadow possessed the trump card, the Hundred Blade Hidden Edge, this move would trigger a blade array storm that made no distinction between friend and foe, and therefore could not be unleashed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo could only watch helplessly as Nightblade Shadow was destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
His heart raced, and his whole body broke into sweat once more; if he had not been wearing mechanical heavy armor, his hair would have stood on end at this moment.<br/>
<br/>
His spiritual energy surged once more!<br/>
<br/>
Even Liu, Guan, and Zhang, in the midst of fierce combat, cast uncertain glances.<br/>
<br/>
Martial Arts - One Punch Splitting the Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Xiang Yue extended his arm, his right fist striking straight.<br/>
<br/>
Bang.<br/>
<br/>
The air exploded, and his fist shone with the color of steel as it harshly collided with the front of Ning Zhuo’s chest.<br/>
<br/>
With a muffled sound, Ning Zhuo retreated three steps in succession.<br/>
<br/>
Since the exchange began, it was the first time that Xiang Yue’s expression changed slightly: “Hmm?”<br/>
<br/>
Liu, Guan, and Zhang stared with wide eyes: “??!”<br/>
<br/>
“!!?” Ning Zhuo himself was extremely shocked.<br/>
<br/>
He did not expect that he was not blasted away, but only retreated three big steps, and managed to steady his body.<br/>
<br/>
“Wait a minute.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Elephant King has been maintaining the Uninterrupted Stance, but when I just came into close contact with him, I was not intimidated at all.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo suddenly realized that after continuously damaging Nightblade Shadow, Yuan Dasheng, and a large number of mechanical dolls, his combat power had risen to the level where he could directly contend with Xiang Yue.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the roaming dragons, Sun Lingtong shouted: “Little Zhuo, you can fight!”<br/>
<br/>
“You can still continue fighting!!” Similar thoughts surged in the hearts of Liu, Guan, and Zhang.<br/>
<br/>
The first to notice this scene was Lin Bufan, who was hidden at the edge of the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo can actually withstand one hit from Xiang Yue.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan’s face was full of incredulity; he suddenly turned his head and looked towards Zhu Xuanji beside him.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, he suddenly understood why, since the battle began, Zhu Xuanji had not been concerned at all about Ning Zhuo’s safety, without any tension whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
“Chief Constable Zhu truly understood Ning Zhuo, knowing that this kid could not be judged by conventional reasoning!” Lin Bufan thought to himself.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was truly not surprised: “Ning Zhuo is the child destined to face calamity, chosen by the three Sect Masters. Such a performance is to be expected.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out a light shout, charged forward, and once again engaged in a duel with Xiang Yue.<br/>
<br/>
With his proactive engagement, the battle situation of this fighting group underwent a revolutionary change.<br/>
<br/>
It was no longer that Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning were passively controlled, but rather a near stalemate!<br/>
<br/>
With Ning Zhuo as the main force to resist Xiang Yue’s pressure, Liu, Guan, and Zhang decisively rallied around Ning Zhuo as the core, continuously flanking him with attacks, or helping to share the onslaught, as well as casting healing spells.<br/>
<br/>
After gathering up the main remnants of Yuan Dasheng and Nightblade Shadow, Ning Zhuo immediately entered a state of complete focus, wholeheartedly engaging in combat with Xiang Yue!<br/>
<br/>
It was his first time ever engaging in direct confrontation with such a strong opponent.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, he had never imagined that he would have such a combat experience.<br/>
<br/>
The pressure that Xiang Yue imposed on Ning Zhuo was still extremely enormous, even though Ning Zhuo’s combat power had already risen to that level.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage was that Xiang Yue’s moves were straightforward, simple, and transparent.<br/>
<br/>
For Xiang Yue, relying on his terrifying physical condition, Nascent Soul-level cultivation, as well as his martial arts and divine abilities, it was already enough to handle almost every challenge in life.<br/>
<br/>
This was undoubtedly quite favorable for Ning Zhuo, whose close-combat skills were lacking.<br/>
<br/>
In a sense, the enormous body of Xiang Yue, who often remained motionless, standing in place, or rampaging about, was the best punching bag for Ning Zhuo.</div>
