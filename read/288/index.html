<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 288: Five Elements Soldier</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The platform was divided into three areas. Two areas were designated for the creation of mechanical constructs, each belonging to a competitor. The central area was for the mechanical battle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">In front of Ning Zhuo was a long table, upon which lay numerous materials. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo quickly scanned these materials and found that they were all of the Qi Refining Stage, low-grade yet familiar to him. They included fist-sized gold, fire essence, ancient wood with spirit patterns, large droplets of frost flower condensation, and charcoal-baked clay. Lastly, there was a single mid-grade spirit stone.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Are there any tools for making mechanical constructs?" Ning Zhuo wondered. He hadn't seen any. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Without tools, crafting mechanical constructs by hand would be ten times more difficult, if not more. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">However, Ning Zhuo noticed that the table was covered with numerous formation patterns, reminiscent of the surgical tables in the Medical Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Perhaps this is set up like those surgical tables, with many mechanical tools stored within," Ning Zhuo thought, wanting to verify this hypothesis. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">However, he found himself restrained by an invisible force and unable to move. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The force only vanished once the start of the palace examination round was announced, allowing Ning Zhuo to move freely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo first looked directly ahead, where his opponent should be. It was an indistinct blur. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Ning Zhuo took a few steps forward to the table. He reached out and touched the surface. After channeling his mana into it, he was indeed able to retrieve many mechanical tools, including a welding torch and tiger-head pliers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">With his hypothesis confirmed, Ning Zhuo instinctively glanced again at the opposite side, only to still see a blur. He decided to ignore it and focused on examining the materials provided for the examination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The fist-sized gold pieces were numerous. There were at least thirty, each resembling a clenched fist. The name "fist-sized gold" came from this resemblance. Ning Zhuo knew well: this was a hard metallic ore with high strength and durability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">"I can use it to construct the skeleton of the mechanical puppet." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">After inspecting the fist-sized gold, he found the quality to be average, the most common type in the market.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Zhuo continued his inspection. The second item was fire essence. This was one of the specialties of Fire Persimmon Immortal City and very familiar to Ning Zhuo, allowing him to quickly check it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The ancient wood with spirit patterns was a large section of wood that Ning Zhuo lifted and placed in front of him for observation. Even though it was sawed off, it still emitted a faint vitality. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The cross-section of the wood was covered with spirit patterns. Any plant that absorbed spiritual energy for a long period of time would develop these patterns. The longer the duration, the more numerous and dense the patterns. Additionally, the more spirit patterns there were, the more efficient the absorption of spiritual energy became.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"This section of ancient wood must have been a spirit plant in its lifetime." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo focused on the distribution and direction of the spirit patterns while examining this material. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"It can be used to store spirit stones and construct a path for spiritual power transmission. Since there's only one spirit stone, it must also retain a part for the creation of a spirit-gathering formation disk!" </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Zhuo continued his inspection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The large droplet of frost flower condensation was as big as a basin. The droplet resembled a large blue bun, round and plump. On its surface were large frost flowers, comparable to an adult's hand. As Ning Zhuo's hand approached, the frost flowers on the droplet's surface quickly melted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"It can be used to make weapon components or cooling auxiliary parts," Ning Zhuo thought of two main application directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Next was the charcoal-baked clay. This clay was black-gray in color. It would undergo significant changes with temperature. When hot, it became a hard solid. When cold, it was sticky and could be easily molded. Additionally, it had outstanding fire resistance. Sometimes, it could be used as coal, providing a burning base material to accumulate heat for mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Finally, there was the single mid-grade spirit stone. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"The quality is ordinary." </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"A single spirit stone isn't enough for prolonged combat. Therefore, a spirit-gathering formation in the mechanical puppet is necessary. This spirit stone can at most serve as a starter stone."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">During the material inspection, Ning Zhuo had already conceived many ideas. Without resting, he seized every moment to officially begin crafting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The first step was to construct the skeleton. Ning Zhuo processed the charcoal-baked clay. He first lowered the temperature to make the clay easy to shape. With his skillful hands, he molded a pile of clay into a deep vessel, standing on the table like a small well dug out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo took the welding torch to melt the fist-sized gold. The gold quickly turned into a pool of golden liquid under the scorching flames. The flowing gold was stored in the small well made of charcoal-baked clay. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo then performed the Gold Lifting Technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">This technique, originating from a trial checkpoint, allowed cultivators to freely extract metals according to their will. In its normal state, the solid fist-sized gold was difficult to purify into gold, with high difficulty and slow progress. But in its liquid state, it was much more efficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"How many times should it be purified for the best result?" Ning Zhuo faced this question. In theory, the more, the better. But in reality, he had to consider the time. Once the time limit was up, he couldn't continue making the construct. Too many purifications would affect the final product. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The question of how many purifications was essentially about having an overall control of the entire crafting process. If he could accurately plan the time for each step, then it would be perfect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">This problem didn't trouble Ning Zhuo. He had a clear plan deep in his heart, and according to this plan, purifying three times at this stage was most suitable. Such a small detail already demonstrated whether a Mechanism Arts cultivator was skilled. These details, when aggregated, had a huge impact on the final product.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo quickly completed this step and moved on to the next. He shaped the golden liquid into the form of a skeleton. Notably, these skeletons were hollow. After completing this step, Ning Zhuo began processing the ancient wood with spirit patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Since there was only one spirit stone, Ning Zhuo had to first use the ancient wood to cut out a formation disk and inscribe a spirit-gathering formation. After completing this step, Ning Zhuo followed the spirit patterns to cut the ancient wood, inserting cylindrical thin wooden strips into the golden skeleton to serve as the core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo used the trial checkpoint's technique, allowing a three-inch cylindrical wooden strip to grow up to five inches. Any longer would be excessive, causing the entire strip to wither and die.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">After completing this step, Ning Zhuo rested for a dozen breaths. Skilled mechanical cultivators often had such good habits — not simply working tirelessly but balancing work and rest. For the next step, Ning Zhuo had to process the fire essence and needed to ensure that his own state was optimal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Processing the fire essence began. He was extremely familiar with this material. Ning Zhuo crafted the fire essence into firecrackers, a mechanical component he was very familiar with. His fire explosion monkey constructs were commonly equipped with these firecrackers as a regular attack method.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">When facing the large droplet of frost flower condensation, Ning Zhuo fully demonstrated his formation skills! </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He set up at least three formations within the frost flower condensation, quickly and steadily. In the formations' eyes, Ning Zhuo filled several ice talismans he made on the spot. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Eventually, this large droplet could change shape at Ning Zhuo's will.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo hung it on the skeleton. Then, he reshaped the charcoal-baked clay, crafting it into a body that fully covered the skeleton. </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">With the remaining time, he returned to mass-produce firecrackers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Finalizing the mechanical puppet, Ning Zhuo named it "The Five Elements Soldier". </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Its attack method primarily relied on mechanical firecrackers, while its defense was handled by the frost flower condensation, which could rush out at critical moments to form armor or a shield.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
