<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Zhu Xuanji's brows furrowed, not relaxing at all. He had just defeated Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, and Yang Chanyu in a one-against-three battle, yet he felt no joy. All along, he had been careful to conceal his true combat strength. The Golden Mountain Stance and Jade Pillar Body, these two divine abilities, were known to very few. This time, because it involved the Lava Immortal Palace and the relics of a Void Refining expert, he was willing to reveal a portion of his strength in public.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Ning Jiufan battled Zheng Shuangjun, Meng Chong, and the Meng family's Golden Core true disciple. Ning Jiufan was defeated and eliminated, Zheng Shuangjun was defeated and eliminated!" This simple message contained complex information. Zhu Xuanji pondered for a moment and understood the truth: "The Zheng family has betrayed the alliance I built with the three families." He had been mentally prepared for this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">He could even guess the reason behind the Zheng family's betrayal and their secret allegiance to the Meng familyâ€”The Great Purity Palace was like a sword hanging over the Zheng family, ready to fall at any moment. The Zheng family was already facing the crisis of annihilation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Under such immense pressure, the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family remained ambiguous, never issuing a clear directive to protect the Zheng family. Naturally, the Zheng family sought self-preservation, desperately searching for a way out. Meng Kui must have made some promises, making the Zheng family feel like they had grasped a lifeline, leading them to secretly side with the Meng family and betray the alliance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">As for the alliance agreement Zhu Xuanji had signed with them, it was naturally dissolved by the Meng family's intervention. Where there is poison, there is an antidote. Where there is an alliance, there are means to dissolve it. Zhu Xuanji silently assessed the situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"Zhou Nongying, Ning Jiufan, Purple Dawn Pavilion's Golden Core true disciple, Zheng Shuangjun, Yang Chanyu, Book Master, and Ning Zhuo have all been eliminated." "Now, in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, only I, Zheng Danlian, Meng family's Meng Chong and Golden Core body cultivator, as well as Song Fuli and Sun Lingtong, remain." "The greatest threat to me should be Zheng Danlian! The Night Rain Demon Weapon in his hand cannot be judged by common sense." "Besides that, it's the alliance of these people."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Once they realize my strength is too high, they will quickly unite against me." In fact, this was one of the reasons Zhu Xuanji had always concealed his true combat strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Who can I ally with now?" "Song Fuli?" Zhu Xuanji, born into the royal family, had a keen sense of timing and was skilled in forming alliances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">In fact, when he first arrived at Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he had no one to rely on but himself. Zhu Xuanji first used the strong reason of investigating a case to openly borrow manpower and resources from the City Lord's Mansion. Even Meng Kui initially harbored hopes and expectations for the royal family and Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Later, Zhu Xuanji leveraged his identity, adapted to the situation, and formed a three-family alliance with the Zhou family, Zheng family, and Ning family. He not only utilized the power of local forces but also avoided being forced into a situation where he had to fight multiple people, thereby preventing the premature exposure of his true combat strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Although the Zheng family betrayed him, it wasn't Zhu Xuanji's fault. The blame lay with the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family for not issuing timely directives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">"In fact, the royal family's delay in issuing directives over such a long period already indicates their stance!" Zhu Xuanji's progress to this point was not solely due to his identity and innate talent; he constantly employed his own strategies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Zhu Xuanji thought for a moment but did not decide to ally with Song Fuli. In his view, the timing of Song Fuli and his cloud merchants' appearance seemed somewhat coincidental.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He could ally with Song Fuli, but couldn't the City Lord do the same? If it came down to a bidding war, Zhu Xuanji was certain he couldn't outbid Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">If both sides were vying for Song Fuli, the probability of him ending up on the losing side was high. Given this, Zhu Xuanji, who had recently been backstabbed by Ning Zhuo, preferred to keep his distance from Song Fuli.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Of course, the main reason for all these decisions was Zhu Xuanji's confidence. He was confident that he could single-handedly withstand the combined forces of everyone else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">The only thing that worried him was not the alliance but the dispersal of everyone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"Zhu Xuanji battled the Entry Standard, Yang Chanyu, and Ning Zhuo. Yang Chanyu was defeated and eliminated, Ning Zhuo conceded and was eliminated?" Similar to Zhu Xuanji's situation, Meng Chong and the Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator were also subject to others' battle reports.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">"How did Ning Zhuo deal with Zhu Xuanji?" Meng Chong was surprised, then exclaimed, "Zhu Xuanji, the divine constable, is impressive! Suppressed to the Foundation Establishment stage, he fought so many people. Can't Sun Lingtong use that mechanical ape in his hand?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator sneered, "It's not just Ning Zhuo's entanglement with the Void Sect, but also the Ning family's desire to meddle in the Lava Immortal Palace! The barbarians of the Northern Wind Kingdom have always been so ambitious." Meng Chong shrugged indifferently, "If it were me, I'd do the same. Why not fight with all my might for the spoils of war?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Golden Core body cultivator wore a contemplative expression, speaking solemnly, "If Sun Lingtong could use the mechanical ape in his hand, Zhu Xuanji's true combat strength would be terrifying." "The Void Sect should still have another Foundation Establishment-level mechanical puppet. It wears a bamboo hat and can command ghosts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The City Lord's Mansion had, of course, gathered intelligence on the three-family alliance battle. Even without this, Ning Zhuo had repeatedly arranged for the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng and Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai to disguise themselves as part of the trial checkpoints, intercepting trial disciples many times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Therefore, the City Lord's Mansion had long anticipated the Netherworld Envoy Qi Bai as a trump card.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Don't forget, with the weakening of restrictions, we can all use our own items. Although Ning Zhuo is only at the mid-stage of Qi Refining, similar to you, Young Master, he is confirmed to have a Golden Core-level mechanical ape with him." "Even if the mechanical ape is suppressed to the Foundation Establishment level, it remains a significant threat." "Add to that the Golden Core true disciple Yang Chanyu from the Void Sect..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Zhu Xuanji actually defeated these three people; his strength is truly terrifying! He hides it well in daily life."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Meng Chong casually placed his hands behind his head, "Why speculate so much? Let's just have a direct fight with Zhu Xuanji and everything will be clear!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator felt exhausted and quickly waved his hand, "War is perilous; avoiding battle is naturally best. In the art of war, it is said: 'The best strategy is to attack the enemy's plans, next is to attack alliances, then to attack armies, and the worst is to attack cities.' We should strive to avoid conflict and secure victory in the most stable manner."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">"Not fight Zhu Xuanji?!" Meng Chong's eyes widened, genuinely looking forward to this battle, only to hear those around him say not to fight?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Meng Chong immediately said, "It's such a rare opportunity. Zhu Xuanji is suppressed to the Foundation Establishment stage, and I can rely on my innate talent to fight him. If we really fight, how exhilarating would that be?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Golden Core body cultivator shook his head repeatedly, "No, no, Young Master, you seem to have forgotten. To seize the position of the Immortal Palace's Palace Master, we must find the correct path in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities, and the first to enter the main hall and sit on the throne will become the Palace Master of the Lava Immortal Palace."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"What you need to do is this, not engage in a reckless battle with Zhu Xuanji." "If we must fight, it will be me joining forces with Zheng Danlian to intercept Zhu Xuanji, buying you time."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Meng Chong's eyes lit up, "It's precisely because it's uncertain that fighting is more interesting. This might be a rare opportunity for our Meng family to compete with the Zhu royal family! I want to see why the Zhu family can overshadow our Meng family and act as the royal family of a kingdom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Too exhausting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator sighed inwardly, seeing that he couldn't persuade Meng Chong, he had to bring up Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">"Young Master, please restrain yourself."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"Our mission this time is arduous, and these arrangements are not from my hand but are one of the strategies personally calculated by your grandfather." "Will you listen to Lord Meng Kui's words?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">This time, it was Meng Chong's turn to sigh, "Sigh! Of course, I have to listen to my grandfather's words." His face was full of regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Meng family's Golden Core body cultivator finally breathed a sigh of relief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit also breathed a huge sigh of relief. It had been closely watching Meng Chong, and seeing the latter's reckless desire to challenge Zhu Xuanji, it wished it could smack his head a few times!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Do you have a brain in your head?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Zhu Xuanji, with three divine abilities! Such an opponent, can you, a mid-stage Qi Refining young cultivator, handle it?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was keenly aware of the battles and was very certain that Zhu Xuanji was the strongest presence in this trial. The only thing that could potentially threaten him directly was that Night Rain Demon Weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Everyone has almost left."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Next, the small opportunity will shuffle the positions of the Secret Pavilion again." "Under my guidance, Meng Chong might be able to exit the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities and be the first to enter the main hall!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Crackling...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shrank into its shell, deep in thought. Around it, dozens of fiery whips continuously lashed at it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">With the weakening of restrictions, it could cheat by secretly informing Meng Chong which way to go. For example, whether to take the left door or the front door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">It still couldn't reveal any information about other cultivators. It would still suffer severe punishment for cheating! In more serious cases, a fiery guillotine would form to behead it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"Ning Zhuo is already out of the picture."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"After the small opportunity, Zhu Xuanji and Meng Chong will be separated, unable to stop Meng Chong from breaking out of the Secret Pavilion." Never before had the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit felt so close to success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"As long as Meng Chong can become the Palace Master, everything I've done will be worth it!" It silently encouraged itself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The light circle spat out Sun Lingtong. As soon as he emerged, he heard a beast's roar in front of him, and a Scarlet Flame Beast lunged at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Sun Lingtong's heart skipped a beat, just as he was about to raise his dagger, the Scarlet Flame Beast's head was severed, and scorching blood gushed out from its neck like a fountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong quickly retreated, avoiding the blood splattering on him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"Yang Chanyu!" Sun Lingtong saw his fellow disciple who had intervened to deal with the Scarlet Flame Beast.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Yang Chanyu didn't look well; her face was as pale as gold paper, and her breath was weak.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
