<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo focused his attention on the butterfly wings behind Rudie Niang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Among the entire framework of the mechanical construct, her wings were the most striking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">At first glance, Ning Zhuo was captivated by these wings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">However, he prioritized probing the main body of the mechanical puppet to its current limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This is the correct sequence for studying a mechanical construct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Understanding the main structure and functions first allows for more accurate testing of other mechanical components.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Rudie Niang's butterfly wings were extraordinarily splendid! Ning Zhuo shifted his angle slightly and could always see the seven-colored rainbow light refracted from the wings, which was incredibly magnificent and exquisite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">After a detailed examination, he was surprised to discover that what appeared to be a single pair of wings was actually seven pairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">These seven pairs of wings were so tightly layered that they seemed like one.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo could imagine that when Rudie Niang fully activated, seven pairs of wings would flutter behind her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Each layer of wings was extremely delicate, with a primary color of red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, or purple, corresponding perfectly to the seven colors of the rainbow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The construction of the wings was so intricate that Ning Zhuo was in awe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">It was the most exquisite mechanical construct he had ever seen!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The wings were composed of countless fine threads forming the foundational structure, supplemented by condensed spiritual energy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Ning Zhuo was not unfamiliar with these threads—he had just found them in Rudie Niang's hands and feet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The technique of solidifying spiritual energy into form was extremely precious, reminiscent of high-grade spirit-gathering formations that could condense ambient spiritual energy into liquid or even spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">However, such high-grade spirit-gathering formations were usually enormous, covering entire mountain peaks or even spreading across half a mountain range.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Thus, the technique of solidifying spiritual energy into form on the wings was terrifying! "Who on earth designed this mechanical puppet?" "To create such functionality on such thin wings?!" "It's terrifying."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">An outsider sees the excitement, but an insider sees the intricacies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">After careful study, Ning Zhuo broke into a cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Rudie Niang's material was not extraordinary, merely of Foundation Establishment grade.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Yet, the cultivation technique was so terrifyingly advanced that it made Ning Zhuo feel a sense of fear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The wings were both sturdy and flexible, and their combined weight was comparable to a sheet of rice paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Ning Zhuo speculated that because the wings were formed by solidified spiritual energy, they likely had a strong self-repairing ability. "It feels like a master of mechanical arts, on a whim, decided to show off and created this Rudie Niang." "Is Song Fuli planning to auction her as the final item at the auction?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo kept speculating in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The style of Rudie Niang's mechanical construction was exquisite, luxurious, and extravagant to the extreme.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">In contrast, the Golden Core-level mechanical body Ning Zhuo crafted for Yuan Dasheng was the opposite—relying on sheer volume and low craftsmanship to achieve results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Continuing his research, Ning Zhuo was shocked to find that each layer of the wings had at least one formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The formations were arranged in a variant style, with extremely high-end techniques, turning the craftsmanship into art.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">It was breathtakingly beautiful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Ning Zhuo exhausted his mind, using various mechanical tools to assist himself, and finally understood the function of the outermost wing formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">His eyes flashed with insight as he grasped the key, exclaiming softly, "I understand, I understand." "The silver crown on her head, the silver patterns under her skin, all complement these wings."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"When the wings are activated, the formation will also be triggered. The outermost wing formation will instantly set up a formation around, altering the space." "At that time, the spherical space centered on Rudie Niang will be cut into countless small pieces by various types of mana. From the outside, it will look like countless tiny, colorful glass shards, stacked together, both beautiful and deadly!" "Activating the formation requires a lot of mana, so the master of mechanical arts deliberately added 'blood' to this mechanical puppet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">"This special spiritual milk can carry a tremendous amount of mana, essentially acting as a constantly transforming mana pool." "Rudie Niang's skin is made of a composite material with high cloud cotton as the main component, allowing it to continuously absorb natural spiritual energy from the outside world." "This spiritual energy is converted and stored in the spiritual milk blood, to be used when the formation is activated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Listening to Ning Zhuo's thorough analysis, Fairy Chanyu couldn't help but raise her eyebrows slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">She suddenly realized that this young man before her was indeed skilled, deducing Rudie Niang's offensive methods after just a bit of probing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Inside the cloud whale, Fairy Chanyu had personally experienced the formation scene Ning Zhuo just speculated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">At that time, she couldn't see the details.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Fortunately, Sun Lingtong stopped it in time, winning with words, otherwise...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Listening to Ning Zhuo now, she realized that being trapped in such a powerful formation would have been costly, even if she could break free. "In a short time, this is all I can detect." Ning Zhuo sighed regretfully, wiping the sweat from his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He said to Sun Lingtong, "Brother Sun, why don't you give it a try?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Sun Lingtong shrugged, "Forget it, in terms of mechanical expertise, both Fairy Chanyu and I are not as good as you." Fairy Chanyu heard this and slightly raised her eyebrows, wanting to refute, but recalling Ning Zhuo's performance just now, she closed her mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">She had to admit that in mechanical arts, this young Qi Refining Stage cultivator indeed had a knack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Sun Lingtong asked Ning Zhuo, his tone cautious, "Should we awaken her now?" Ning Zhuo frowned slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">To be honest, after this examination, he was somewhat apprehensive about Rudie Niang's combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Despite her being made of Foundation Establishment-grade materials, such terrifying cultivation techniques could allow her to exert power comparable to a Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Cultivation is, after all, the study and utilization of the truths of the world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Once Rudie Niang awakened, she could be a double-edged sword beside Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">But ultimately, Ning Zhuo nodded slowly and said to Sun Lingtong, "Awaken her."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">After deep contemplation, Ning Zhuo realized he had little choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Once the palace examination began, the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace would undoubtedly be a bloody storm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">His opponents would be numerous Golden Cores, and even Nascent Soul-level like Meng Kui.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">By that time, his cultivation would at most reach the Foundation Establishment Stage, and based on the timeline, it would only be the early Foundation Establishment Stage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Therefore, he must seize every opportunity to secure high-end combat power for his side! Rudie Niang's quasi-Golden Core combat power was something Ning Zhuo had to strive for.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">For this, he needed to take a gamble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">And here, in the medical pavilion of the Lava Immortal Palace, was the most suitable environment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">With Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu by his side, it was the safest time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Take a gamble and awaken Rudie Niang! The method to awaken Rudie Niang was simple: recite the secret incantation from before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sun Lingtong recited it once, quite fluently and with clear enunciation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo listened to the chant, glanced at Sun Lingtong, and his eyes flickered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sun Lingtong also looked at Ning Zhuo and glared at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Their small interaction ended quickly, but Fairy Chanyu, standing nearby, keenly caught it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"What's going on?" She was moved, instantly realizing that the relationship between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong might not be as simple as collaborators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">After Sun Lingtong finished singing, he gently patted Rudie Niang's shoulder and arm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">He softly called, "Rudie Niang, Rudie Niang, wake up."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Rudie Niang slowly opened her eyes, her clear, water-like gaze sweeping around before fixing on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Her voice remained gentle, with a slight tremor, "Where is this? Are you the mechanical cultivator who repaired me?" Ning Zhuo nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong said, "Rudie Niang, for the next period, follow this mechanical cultivator. He can cure your ailments, but you need to cooperate fully."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Rudie Niang behaved very obediently, nodding gently without any suspicion. "Can I stand up?" she asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Rudie Niang then floated up, her wings behind her gently flapping, allowing her to hover in mid-air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">She kept looking at Ning Zhuo, her large eyes suddenly welling up with tears, which then fell like large beads.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Such an extremely lifelike display surprised the three cultivators present.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Rudie Niang reached out, lowered her head slightly, and gently wiped her tears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Then she continued to stare at Ning Zhuo, her gaze unwavering, "Healer, is my condition serious? Can it still be cured?" Ning Zhuo secretly praised her, "She's worried about her 'illness,' such intelligence far surpasses Yuan Dasheng!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Zhuo nodded and reassured her, "The problem isn't severe, but the treatment is quite complicated and will take a long time. You need to be patient." "During this process, I need your full cooperation. For example, conducting real combat to test your body. Any command I give, you must strictly follow, understand?" "Yes, Little Butterfly understands." Rudie Niang nodded obediently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">As Sun Lingtong had conveyed, Rudie Niang was simple-minded and quite easy to deceive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Calculating the time, it was about right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Ning Zhuo began tidying up the severe treatment room, putting everything back in place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">The materials Sun Lingtong had given him, along with Rudie Niang, were temporarily stored here, not intended to be taken out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sun Lingtong communicated with Ning Zhuo, "What do you plan to do about Ning Xiaohui?" "She's been striving for the position at the Historical Records Pavilion." "Your entry into the Immortal Palace seems to have spurred her." "She's practically working herself to death, resting only one or two hours a day, striving for achievements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"If she succeeds, then even our secret meeting this time might be recorded by the Historical Records Pavilion." Ning Zhuo sighed, "Ning Xiaohui is a big problem, and I'm currently looking for an opportunity." "From my observations over the past few days, the Golden Core ancestors place great importance on the reformation team." "No matter the situation, they always keep at least two people active near the reformation team."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"I believe that Ning Xiaohui, entrusted with such an important task, is certainly being protected. And the level of protection for her is much higher than for us." "Eliminating her is very risky; we need to find the right opportunity. At the same time, we need to find a way to deal with the subsequent investigation." "Currently, Zhu Xuanji seems to have discovered something, and his attention on me is quite unusual." "If anything happens to Ning Xiaohui, I fear I'll be the first one he investigates thoroughly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"I have some confidence in disguising myself, but I'm most afraid of being imprisoned and temporarily losing my freedom!" This situation would be fatal for Ning Zhuo! Sun Lingtong nodded, agreeing with Ning Zhuo's assessment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Fairy Chanyu added, "According to your previous plan, you intended to stir up the cloud merchants to create an opportunity for yourselves."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"But strangely, so many days have passed, and logically, the cloud merchants should have discovered the fake goods we left behind. Yet, there's been no movement from them!" After raiding the auction warehouse, Sun Lingtong and Fairy Chanyu had used their methods to create corresponding fake goods and placed them back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">They retraced their steps, replacing the empty spots on the shelves with fake items, creating the illusion that the goods were still there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">They deliberately designed these fake items to disappear automatically after a few days, revealing a huge flaw.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">According to the plan, the cloud merchants should have erupted days ago.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Yet, until now, there's been nothing but silence from that side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">It's very peculiar!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
