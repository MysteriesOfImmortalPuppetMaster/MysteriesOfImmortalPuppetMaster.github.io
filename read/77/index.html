<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 77: It’s Actually an Immortal Talent</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">After searching for an entire day and night, the many Golden Core cultivators still hadn't dug out the black shadow demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Faced with this fact, the four great factions of Fire Persimmon Immortal City were all left in disgrace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The lockdown of the immortal city had yet to lift, but even so, rumors swirled and undercurrents surged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Zhu Xuanji approached Fei Si to obtain some fragments of the rioting mechanical monkeys that had attacked Yuan Er.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Since the black shadow demonic cultivator hadn’t appeared, these mechanical fragments were the only clue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zhu Xuanji fiddled with the fragments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">He had also acquired the blueprint for the explosive fire monkey, memorizing it after taking a few glances.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Half a cup of tea’s worth of time later, Zhu Xuanji had assembled the fragments in his hands into three mechanical monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">These explosive fire monkeys were all heavily damaged and barely standing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Zhu Xuanji took out some control threads, infused magical power, and began operating the explosive fire monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">If Fei Si were to see this, he would surely be shocked and think, “So Zhu Xuanji has this kind of skill, too.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Indeed, Zhu Xuanji had a certain degree of ability in the mechanical arts. This was one of the reasons he had been chosen to come investigate this place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Moments later, Zhu Xuanji put away all the control threads and sighed, having found nothing of value.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">“Let's review again.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Zhu Xuanji closed his eyes and recalled the process of his investigation. First was the mechanical monkey, then the thousand jin of fire essence, and finally the black shadow demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Using the mechanical monkey to bomb the palace was clearly a measure against the Root Tracking Origin Tracing Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">“The thousand jin of fire essence was obtained without leaving traces in the market. If the culprit is one of the four great forces, doing so would be easy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“The black shadow demonic cultivator’s disappearance most likely points to an inside agent who secretly let them go.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">All clues pointed toward this: one of the three great clans of Fire Persimmon Immortal City was the likely mastermind behind the bombing of the immortal palace and the black shadow demonic cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“But if the black shadow demonic cultivator had already escaped in advance, why cause the mechanical monkeys to riot during the Fire Persimmon Festival and implicate the Monkey Head Gang?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">“Wouldn’t that be completely unnecessary?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Zhu Xuanji's thoughts went even deeper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">“Maybe they wanted to use this as a disguise and create the illusion that the black shadow demonic cultivator was still at the scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“They also most likely eliminated the old ape because its performance was too outstanding. Dealing with it in public served to weaken the authority of the City Lord Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">“Lastly, they clearly intend to confuse me and slow down my investigation.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Bang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Zhu Xuanji clenched his fist and slammed it against the jade table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">He sensed the enemy's provocation. These broken mechanical monkeys seemed to be mocking his incompetence, as if saying, “Go ahead and investigate, I’ve even left you some clues!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">But Zhu Xuanji had already learned his lesson. He knew that since his enemy did this, following this line of clues would be pointless. He would only be wasting time and effort.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">“If the mechanical monkeys are a provocation, then was it really the old ape that was the problem?” This thought had occurred to Zhu Xuanji, which was why he turned back halfway on the day of the Fire Persimmon Festival and went so far as to use a top-grade medicinal liquid to test whether the old ape's mind had been affected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The results showed that it had not.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">After much painful deliberation, he slowly opened his eyes and thought, “The most suspicious thing is still that explosion!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Deep in the night, Zhu Xuanji concealed his presence and returned to the Monkey Head Gang’s headquarters. Using a spell, he put Yuan Er into a deep, death-like sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Then, he took out the top-grade medicinal liquid and carefully dripped a single drop onto Yuan Er, but saw no effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Zhu Xuanji sighed in frustration. “What was I even thinking? The odds of Yuan Er’s mind being influenced are far too low!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Hmph, and this little wretch even wasted a drop of my top-grade medicinal liquid.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Zhu Xuanji looked at the sleeping Yuan Er with a sour expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">As he turned to leave, he flicked his sleeve. A gust of air struck Yuan Er’s cheek, causing a crisp slap to echo out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Zhu Xuanji quietly left the Monkey Head Gang’s headquarters. Walking beneath a sky full of stars, he headed once more to the peak of Fire Persimmon Mountain to meet the City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">“City Lord Meng Kui, I want to review all the records and thoroughly investigate every person who has ever entered or exited the Lava Immortal Palace over the years!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Zhuo returned home and rested for a while, patiently waiting until midnight before donning the Iron Will Gray Armor and once again disguising himself as Hanging-Hair Traveler.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He teleported to the underground prison and met with Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">As soon as the cell door opened, he saw Han Ming squatting on the ground, scratching at her head in a terribly unsightly posture.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Han Ming was startled and quickly stood up. In a panic, she waved her hands at Ning Zhuo and said fearfully, “Sir, please don’t give me any more monkey souls. My soul needs time to digest and purify them!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">“My soul has already become deformed and taken on many monkey traits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">“My behavior has already started changing unconsciously!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo nodded. He knew the principle of not draining the pond to catch fish, so he gently said, “You’ve worked hard recently. For now, you just need to absorb this ape and then I’ll let you rest for a while.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">All the wild monkeys Ning Zhuo had been buying up went directly to Han Ming for absorption.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Thanks to this, Ning Zhuo’s soul foundation had increased more than eightyfold since he first met Han Ming.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">At the same time, he clearly saw the rapid deterioration of Han Ming’s condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Thud.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Yuan Dasheng’s corpse was pulled from a storage pouch and thrown to the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Han Ming was startled, and her hair stood on end. She could tell at first glance that this old ape was no ordinary being.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Devour its soul and you can take a break,” Ning Zhuo said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">When handling the corpse, Ning Zhuo had intentionally worn down Yuan Dasheng’s soul and sealed it within the body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Yuan Dasheng had not cultivated any soul-related techniques, so it could only be at Ning Zhuo’s mercy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">But even so, there were still risks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo's best option was to let Han Ming devour it, then drain power from Han Ming afterward, thus making the most of this loot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“Thank you, Sir, for your consideration!” Han Ming swallowed hard and began to perform the Soul Devouring Incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">But in the next instant, a flash of golden light erupted from Yuan Dasheng's corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Pfft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Han Ming suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood, her eyes rolled back, and she fainted on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo was startled. While controlling several small puppets to administer emergency aid, he carefully examined Yuan Dasheng’s corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Han Ming quickly regained consciousness and cried out in lingering fear, “Righteous Bone Golden Hardness! This… is a super-grade innate talent!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Super-grade innate talent? That old ape had an immortal talent? Are you sure you aren’t mistaken?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Han Ming nodded, staring at the old ape’s corpse with certainty. She declared, “Absolutely not mistaken! I’ve studied the sect’s classics thoroughly, and I can confirm that this is Righteous Bone Golden Hardness. The bearer is usually innately loyal and unwavering, with an indomitable spirit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">“Their bones are incredibly hard, comparable to diamond, and their physical body is likewise solid and resilient. When the soul clings to such bones, it becomes unshakable and unaffected by external forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“In my current state, I can’t absorb this soul. Even at my peak I might not succeed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">At this moment, Han Ming also recognized the old ape’s identity and sighed emotionally. “To think that the old ape of Monkey Head Gang, Yuan Yi’s monkey pet, actually had an immortal talent!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Then, Han Ming suddenly froze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">She quickly looked up at Ning Zhuo, her eyes gleaming with sharp light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
