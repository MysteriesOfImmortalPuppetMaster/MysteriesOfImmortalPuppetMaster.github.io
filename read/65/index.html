<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 65: The Fire Persimmon Festival</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Every time the Fire Persimmon Festival arrived, Fire Persimmon Immortal City would become a ghost town. The city residents would leave the immortal city and head into the wilderness along the mountainside and foothills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">At that time, Fire Persimmon Forest would be partially opened to the public.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Both mortals and cultivators would participate in the harvest of fire persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">It was a grand celebration for the entire city. Since the year it was founded by the very first City Lord, the festival had never once been suspended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">This year‚Äôs Fire Persimmon Festival was quite different from those in the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Some months ago, Chi Dun‚Äôs pursuit of the black shadow demonic cultivator had shaken the entire city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Even those residents who didn‚Äôt witness it personally had heard from others how the black shadow demonic cultivator had been driven into Fire Persimmon Forest and sealed within the layers of formations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Before this year‚Äôs Fire Persimmon Festival even began, Fei Si had already taken charge of the city‚Äôs defense, placing the entire city under martial law.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">On the day of Fire Persimmon Festival, the City Lord sat high atop Fire Persimmon Mountain and personally activated the immortal city‚Äôs grand formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Countless green formation patterns appeared in the air, throughout the city, and on the ground, crisscrossing in majestic lines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">And that was only the portion visible to the naked eye; the majority of the formation existed deep in the body of Fire Persimmon Mountain, continuously drawing in earth energy and lava and channeling it into every corner of Fire Persimmon Immortal City to power various alchemy rooms, artifact crafting rooms, mechanical workshops, and other facilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The place that consumed the most lava and earth energy was none other than Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The fire persimmon trees absorbed the lava and earth energy and turned it into fire persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Fire persimmons could serve as fuel like fire essence, could be eaten, could be used for alchemy or artifact crafting‚Ä¶ there were countless uses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">When the city was first built, Fire Persimmon Forest was just a small patch of trees. Now, it had spread across almost the entire mountain base, wrapping the foot of Fire Persimmon Mountain in a magnificent fiery red ring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Under the watchful gaze of countless city residents, large numbers of Foundation Establishment stage cultivators headed out of the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">These cultivators were mostly from the City Lord Mansion and the three major clans. A few came from trusted factions like the Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Each Foundation Establishment cultivator brought with them several mechanical monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Yuan Dasheng followed beside Yuan Er. Its massive and burly figure stood out among the cultivators leaving the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move out too.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo, Chen Cha, and other mechanical cultivators also secretly left the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">These cultivators were there for on-the-spot repairs; this was one of Fei Si‚Äôs measures to prevent accidents.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">After exiting the city, they didn‚Äôt go directly down into Fire Persimmon Forest, but instead entered a well-hidden and well-protected formation on the mountainside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The formation also displayed the scene within Fire Persimmon Forest, making it easier for the mechanical cultivators to monitor the mechanical monkeys in real time and identify any issues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">On the mountainside, Zhu Xuanji concealed his presence and quietly gazed at Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Chi Dun did the same, hiding who knows where.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The Golden Core cultivators of the three major clans also remained out of sight, secretly deployed by the City Lord Mansion and stationed around Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A net to capture the black shadow demonic cultivator had already been deployed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">‚ÄúBegin.‚Äù Fei Si, the only Golden Core cultivator appearing out in the open, oversaw the entire operation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">With a single command, the many Foundation Establishment cultivators charged into Fire Persimmon Forest with their mechanical monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">In the past few days, the Foundation Establishment cultivators of the three major clans had been rigorously practicing mechanical arts and honing their skills at controlling mechanical monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Generally speaking, a single Foundation Establishment cultivator could control at least three mechanical monkeys to pick fire persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Seeing the countless mechanical monkeys leaping into the flaming red persimmon forest, Yuan Er grew slightly anxious and gave a final rallying cry: ‚ÄúBrothers, it‚Äôs all up to you now.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">‚ÄúGive it everything you‚Äôve got, and show everyone that our Monkey Head Gang is the best at harvesting fire persimmons!‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Fire Persimmon Forest was divided by formations into countless layers according to the age of the fire persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">At first, only the areas with fire persimmons under ten years old were opened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The mechanical monkeys constantly harvested persimmons. Every time they picked one, it would be absorbed into the storage formation embedded in their chests.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Looking from above, it could be seen that the fire persimmons were vanishing rapidly, leaving only the fiery red leaves clinging to the branches.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Once the mechanical monkeys reached max capacity, they were remotely recalled by the Foundation Establishment cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">They returned to a massive circular formation and spit out the stored fire persimmons, piling them on the ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Once a pile reached one zhang in height, the formation activated and teleported the fire persimmons directly into the City Lord Mansion‚Äôs granary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">After all the fire persimmon under ten years old were harvested, Fei Si opened the section with those over ten years old.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Once those were gathered, it was time for the twenty-year fire persimmons, then the thirty-year‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The age kept increasing, until it reached one hundred years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Boom!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">With a loud sound, a fire persimmon exploded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Almost instantly, it triggered a chain reaction among the surrounding fire persimmons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Terrifying flames swiftly engulfed over a dozen explosive fire monkeys. As for the Foundation Establishment controllers, they were far enough away and suffered no casualties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">In that moment, countless gazes turned toward the scene of the explosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Fei Si frowned and immediately ordered an investigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">A Foundation Establishment cultivator from Zhou Clan was quickly brought forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Fei Si‚Äôs face was expressionless. ‚ÄúYou were the one who mishandled the mechanical monkey?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The Zhou Clan Foundation Establishment cultivator‚Äôs face was pale as he nodded weakly. He wanted to defend himself, but he knew clearly that with the grand formation active, everything was being recorded from all angles. Any lies would be exposed immediately, and he would have to suffer even more severe consequences.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Fei Si‚Äôs brows furrowed slightly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be paying for all the destroyed fire persimmons later. You have half a cup of tea‚Äôs time to calm your mind, then resume your duties.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">‚ÄúYes.‚Äù The Zhou Clan cultivator accepted the order and stepped back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Boom.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After a short while, a mechanical monkey suddenly malfunctioned. While retrieving a fire persimmon, it bumped against another and triggered an explosion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Fei Si reviewed the footage and confirmed it was a fault in the mechanical monkey itself. He immediately traced the monkey‚Äôs serial number back to its manufacturing workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">It was the Flying Disk Workshop.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Fei Si promptly ordered his men to notify Chen Cha and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">A messenger was sent, carrying a reprimand from Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Inside the formation where the mechanical cultivators were stationed, a replay of the moment before the explosion was being shown. The focus of the footage was the malfunctioning mechanical monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">After watching the footage, Chen Cha quickly came to a conclusion. ‚ÄúThat mechanical monkey had been in use for too long. Its structure melted and degraded, which is what caused the malfunction.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Chen Cha turned to look at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">This mechanical monkey was one of the low-quality ones produced from Ning Zhuo‚Äôs revised blueprint.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo mused, ‚ÄúThe temperature in the hundred-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest seems a bit higher than in previous years. Have the Foundation Establishment cultivators pause for now. Crush some Clear Dew Pills and mix them with water, then pour the solution over the mechanical monkeys. Be sure to soak them thoroughly, to the point that water collects on the surface.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">After giving these instructions, Ning Zhuo resumed repairing mechanical monkeys.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ever since the festival started, damaged and malfunctioning mechanical monkeys had been continually sent over for repairs before being rushed back into the field.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">As time passed, more and more mechanical monkeys were breaking down, causing Ning Zhuo and the others to get busier and busier. Eventually, they started struggling to keep up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Sweating profusely, Chen Cha took the chance to remind Ning Zhuo, ‚ÄúLittle Zhuo, do you see now? This is what cutting corners gets you.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Ning Zhuo sighed. ‚ÄúOld Chen, isn‚Äôt this failure rate exactly what I was aiming for?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">‚ÄúBesides, many of these mechanical monkeys were damaged due to operator error. That‚Äôs not my fault.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">The hardship was only temporary. Soon, the number of mechanical monkeys being sent for repairs began to decrease.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">This was because the teams had finished harvesting the hundred-year fire persimmon and were now entering the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Thousand-year-old fire persimmons were as big as washbasins, born from the boundless earth energy and lava drawn out by the grand formation. Each one was extremely valuable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">The Foundation Establishment cultivators all became cautious, each putting all their focus into operating a single mechanical monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">If any of these fire persimmons exploded and triggered a chain reaction, it was enough to wipe out all of a Foundation Establishment cultivator‚Äôs savings!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Since each person was only operating one mechanical monkey, it was only natural that the number of monkeys sent in for repairs decreased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
