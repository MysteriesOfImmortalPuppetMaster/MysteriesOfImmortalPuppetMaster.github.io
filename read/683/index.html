<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The Teleportation Stone Chamber within Jade Cleansing Hall was small.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The floor, walls, and ceiling were covered in intricate formation patterns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Sun Lingtong stepped out of the Formation and approached the only door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Instead of immediately pushing it open, he cautiously activated his Theft Path Methods to probe the world beyond.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">After employing five different detection techniques, he finally confirmed the door was safe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">He took a deep breath and transmitted a message to Ning Zhuo via divine sense: "Little Zhuo, I'm opening the door now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">A Life Hanging by a Thread connection had always linked Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Zhuo nodded inwardly and replied, "I'm ready."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The large-headed youth sat in his Cave Abode at Vine-Clasping Cliff, his mind fully focused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Jade Cleansing Hall had been his mother's Cave Abode in life, and Ning Zhuo naturally wished to explore it himself. However, reason dictated a more sensible arrangement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Sun Lingtong's higher cultivation level and mastery of numerous Theft Path Methods made him the ideal candidate for this perilous exploration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">During the battle in Forgetful River Prefecture, Sun Lingtong had even infiltrated deep behind enemy lines, reaching the capital city of a nation. After wreaking havoc, he had made a daring escape.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">His achievements had a profound impact on the Altar Battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Clang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Although he relied on Zeng Jide, a senior fellow sect member, if Ning Zhuo were in Sun Lingtong's position, he knew he could never match Sun Lingtong's performance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong was suited for frontline exploration, while Ning Zhuo excelled at providing backup.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">No one was better suited for this role!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo had mastered the Divine Technique: Life Hanging by a Thread. Combined with his Spirit Communication Realm, rescuing Sun Lingtong would be as simple as a thought. Back in White Paper Immortal City, not even the Dao Field could prevent Ning Zhuo from saving Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Of course, within the Jade Cleansing Hall, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were separated by formations and magic restrictions. Whether this external rescue method would still work remained uncertain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">But this arrangement was the greatest insurance they could devise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Exploring the Jade Cleansing Hall was risky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">In her message on the Jade Slip, Buddhist Doctor Meng Yaoyin revealed no further details. Her condition had reached its limit, forcing her to prioritize the most critical information for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">She only warned him that the Jade Cleansing Hall was heavily guarded and lacked bloodline recognition mechanisms, urging him to proceed with extreme caution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After all, when she left the Myriad Manifestations Sect, she had no idea she would give birth to a son.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Sun Lingtong pushed open the door and entered a secret chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">In the center of the chamber sat a formation plate the size of a millstone, slowly rotating on the floor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The plate was carved from a single piece of Lake-Sinking Jade Marrow and inlaid with three hundred and sixty Water-Patterned Steel Beads. The beads were interconnected by a network of fine lines, through which faint traces of flowing water could be seen.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Extending from the plate's base were over a hundred formation patterns, varying in thickness and resembling crystalline veins of water or the roots of a living creature burrowing into the surrounding walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">A sharp glint flashed in Sun Lingtong's eyes. "This is the Formation Nexus Chamber that controls the entire Jade Cleansing Hall Cave Abode!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Zhuo exclaimed joyfully, "In that case, as long as we control this place, we can bypass all the defenses within the Jade Cleansing Hall! No wonder Mother didn't explain much in the Jade Slip."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Sun Lingtong remained silent, a sense of unease stirring within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He had always taken such feelings of unease very seriously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">With his extensive experience in theft, Sun Lingtong knew that whenever he felt something was off during a heist, it meant he had sensed some ominous detail without fully understanding it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Instead of rushing into action, Sun Lingtong carefully observed the chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">He activated his Innate Spirit Eye, focusing his gaze for a moment, and broke out in a cold sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"These Water-Patterned Steel Beads are actually condensed Water-Attribute Yin Lightning. Once triggered, the formation patterns will seal the entire room, locking down the Void."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"At that point, anyone who has breached the formation will meet a gruesome end. No, the entire Jade Cleansing Hall will be instantly annihilated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong wiped the sweat from his brow, sighing, "Aunt placed the teleportation array in the Formation Nexus Chamber. How could she not have taken precautions?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"That's exactly what felt off to me!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">"If it were me, having set up a secret passage connecting to the outside world, I would have anticipated enemies using it to teleport into the Jade Cleansing Hall."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"This formation plate has identity recognition capabilities. Until I crack this layer and achieve proper disguise, I absolutely cannot touch it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lingtong made his decision.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">His gaze swept the room. "Next, I need to choose one of these six doors."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The Formation Nexus Chamber housed the formation plate for the entire Cave Abode. A small, clearly added-on room contained only the teleportation array.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Apart from these, there were six doors distributed across the four walls.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Maintaining his detection spell at all times, Sun Lingtong began to move cautiously through the Formation Nexus Chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Every two or three steps, Sun Lingtong would pause, activate a round of Theft Path Methods to scan the formation patterns around him, then pull out various talismans and release them in quick succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Even Ning Zhuo, watching his movements, felt dizzy from the speed and complexity of his techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo couldn't help but hold his breath, his body and mind tense with anticipation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">He knew Sun Lingtong well. He understood that Sun Lingtong was now using his full strength. In their decade-long friendship, he had never seen him exert himself like this more than five times.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Sun Lingtong pressed on with all his might, moving in fits and starts, sometimes backtracking or taking detours. It took him the time it would take to drink half a cup of tea to finally reach a door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Yet the straight-line distance between his starting point and the door was no more than twenty steps.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">After informing Ning Zhuo and receiving confirmation, Sun Lingtong pushed open the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">A flood of light poured in, causing Sun Lingtong's pupils to contract.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Before him lay a curved corridor supported by twelve ice-crystal jade pillars. An invisible force held back the surrounding lake water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Outside the corridor, the Jade Lake's fish and aquatic plants were visible in perfect detail. A school of fish darted overhead, their tails stirring ripples that seemed about to spill into the corridor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo stood frozen, stunned by this unexpected sight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sun Lingtong's heart pounded. He transmitted a message with his divine sense: "This is an Array Void Construction Realm!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo, reminded of this, was equally shocked. "Y-yes, it seems so."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">The Array Void Construction Realm was an advanced formation technique, far beyond the capabilities of cultivators with only a superficial understanding of the Formation Dao.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Ning Zhuo had already encountered a similar level of difficulty with the Formless Pivot technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">During the Black Cloud Battlefield incident, Ning Zhuo had located the formation's pivot but was unable to destroy it - precisely because of the Formless Pivot technique!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Sun Lingtong, whose mastery of the Formation Dao surpassed Ning Zhuo's, was the first to recognize it. Staring at the corridor before them, his eyes gleamed with awe as he exclaimed, "This is the first time I've ever witnessed this formation technique firsthand!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">"Creating internal space within a formation is already rare. But the Array Void Construction Realm allows you to dismantle, reshape, and reconstruct that internal space."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"From the outside, the Jade Cleansing Hall Cave Abode appears to be merely a palace at the bottom of the lake."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"But from the inside, the palace has been reconfigured and integrated with the cave abode's formation, creating a wondrous state where architecture and formation are seamlessly fused!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"Little Zhuo, what level of mastery did your mother truly achieve in the Formation Dao?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo's mouth went dry. "I don't know either, Elder Brother. You know my situation. You've read all the classic texts my mother left behind."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"Wait, how are you so sure this was set up by my mother and not just part of the Jade Cleansing Hall's original design?" Ning Zhuo asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Sun Lingtong shook his head, his conviction unwavering. "The Jade Cleansing Hall's status is comparable to the Boulder Cave Abode - both are among the top cave abodes on their respective peaks."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"But you've already been to the Boulder Cave Abode. What was its formation like?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Even Xie Tang's Nine Palaces Formation, in terms of grade and complexity, is far inferior to the Grand Formation here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"This must be Aunt's work!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo blinked, his eyes slightly reddened. He sighed. "Ah, if only Mother had left me some classic texts on the Formation Dao, my mastery might have rivaled Shen Xi's by now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Sun Lingtong shook his head. "This was likely your mother's deliberate choice. Leaving advanced texts behind might have attracted trouble. After all, you were only two years old at the time. Your mother wouldn't have fully trusted an outsider like me either."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong stood motionless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">He dared not move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">This corridor was clearly not designed for sightseeing. Beneath the beautiful underwater scenery lay traps and lethal mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">This was undoubtedly another layer of anti-theft measures.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Sun Lingtong observed for the time it takes to burn an incense stick, his brow furrowed in concentration, before finally attempting to proceed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">He tiptoed forward, taking an incredibly cautious step. As his front foot landed on the stone tile, ripples of water surged across the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Sun Lingtong took several more steps, his path zigzagging wildly. The ripples multiplied, creating a qualitative change.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Several water arrows materialized from thin air and shot toward him simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Forced to evade, Sun Lingtong retreated hastily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">This only triggered more defenses. A stream of water lashed out from behind, coiling around his waist and binding him tightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Lingtong tried to retaliate, but the water carried the power of a restriction, preventing him from reacting in time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Life Hanging by a Thread!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Spirit Communication Mirror!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">In that critical moment, Ning Zhuo acted swiftly to rescue him, pulling Sun Lingtong away from the danger and into their Cave Abode at Vine-Clasping Cliff.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Sun Lingtong, still shaken, exclaimed, "That formation is terrifying! Little Zhuo, if you hadn't intervened, I would have been seriously injured."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo replied, "Boss, you took the hit for me."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Sun Lingtong waved his hand dismissively. "No, I should be thanking you for giving me this chance for theft and adventure. It's absolutely exhilarating, ha ha ha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong laughed heartily, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"You know what? The tougher the challenge ahead, the more my competitive spirit burns. Little Zhuo, let's decipher the formation in this corridor together."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo nodded emphatically.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The brothers first compiled the intelligence they had gathered, then discussed the formation within the corridor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">During their discussion, Ning Zhuo brought out the classic texts left behind by his mother, inviting Sun Lingtong to study them together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Although the texts covered basic principles and focused more on Mechanism Art, they still offered subtle clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">After all, these were the works of Ning Zhuo's mother. Through them, they could discern the author's temperament, thought patterns, and habits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"This is difficult, far too difficult," Sun Lingtong sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Despite their efforts, they had gained little insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo: "We'll need to probe it a few more times to fully understand the corridor's formation layout."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Sun Lingtong's expression turned grave. "I don't think we have many attempts left. Aunt wouldn't have designed it this way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Based on the current formation patterns, triggering it a few more times could seal the entire corridor."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">"At least that's what we can expect."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">"What I'm more worried about is that it might activate the central formation plate, triggering the Jade Cleansing Hall's self-destruction!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment. "If that's the case, we'll need to deepen our understanding of the Formation Dao."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Sun Lingtong shook his head. "That's unreliable. Mastering the Hundred Crafts of Cultivation isn't something you can achieve overnight. Miraculous encounters like your breakthrough in the Five Elements Realm are exceedingly rare."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ning Zhuo sighed. "Well, let's try it first and see what happens."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">His foundation in the Formation Dao was solid, and Sun Lingtong's skills were even more advanced. Yet, working together, the brothers felt their own inadequacy before the Formation laid by Meng Yaoyin.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Despite possessing the formidable Formation Gap Shuttle, Sun Lingtong couldn't find an opportunity to use it - he couldn't detect any flaws or gaps in the Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Using the Earth Evasion Technique to burrow into the mountain, Sun Lingtong guided the Formation Gap Shuttle through the Thousand Vine Cloud-Drinking Formation and entered the Teleportation Stone Chamber.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Activating the teleportation array, he once again entered the Jade Cleansing Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Passing through the Formation Nexus Chamber, he chose the same door as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Pushing it open, he and Ning Zhuo faced the same dilemma as before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">The corridor hadn't fully returned to calm; ripples of water still echoed across the brick floor. This hadn't been the case previously, confirming Sun Lingtong's ominous suspicion - they didn't have many attempts left!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Just as Sun Lingtong was about to continue testing the formation, a thunderous explosion suddenly erupted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"What's happening?!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed, startled, as he looked up at the sky.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">He was currently at the bottom of Jade Lake, where he witnessed the water violently churning into surging currents. The tremors weren't confined to the lake; the entire Cloud Demon Peak was shaking.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">Ning Zhuo tensed, nearly activating his Divine Art to pull Sun Lingtong back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Shaking! He realized with surprise that Vine-Clasping Cliff, where he stood, was also trembling.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"What's going on?" Sun Lingtong was the first to regain his composure, certain that the disturbance wasn't caused by his actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ning Zhuo immediately dispatched Old Chef to investigate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Old Chef was new to the area and lacked expertise in intelligence gathering. Aware of this limitation, Ning Zhuo sent a second message via flying letter to contact Yu Heye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Shortly after, Yu Heye's flying letter arrived first.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Yu Heye reported that he had also been startled by the tremors. He informed Ning Zhuo that a young cultivator named Niu Cheng was attempting to locate Xie Tang's Array Dao Magical Treasure, triggering the Nine Palaces Formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The Nine Palaces referred to the nine mountain peaks, including Vine-Clasping Cliff and Cloud Demon Peak. Consequently, all nine peaks trembled simultaneously.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">At the end of his letter, Yu Heye shared his deduction: Niu Cheng, possessing innate talent capable of causing such a massive disturbance, was likely about to succeed. If Ning Zhuo desired the Array Dao Magical Treasure, Yu Heye pledged to exert every effort to assist him, repaying Ning Zhuo's life-saving debt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Ning Zhuo wrote back to reassure Yu Heye, advising him to disregard the matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">However, Old Chef had yet to return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Without any guards by his side, Ning Zhuo hesitated to fully immerse himself in exploring the Jade Cleansing Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Meng Yehu and Yuan Dasheng were still under repair, and the process remained complicated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">He had originally relied on Old Chef, but the man had been dispatched to gather intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">As for Qing Chi, Ning Zhuo couldn't depend on a girl suffering from amnesia.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">By nature cautious, Ning Zhuo immediately sent a flying message recalling Old Chef. He also contacted Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Sun Lingtong sat cross-legged on the tiled floor, his eyes gleaming with insight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">"Little Zhuo, don't rush! I've already deciphered the secrets of the corridor's Formation."</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
