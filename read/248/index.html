<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Such a response immediately gave Sun Lingtong a direct understanding of her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly, "You're quite right. Well done!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"We need to inspect all the warehouse goods now. If there are any defective items, we'll collect them for further repairs. Can you make way?" The automaton, Rudie Niang, shook her head slightly, "You two are quite strange. Even if you're one of us, do you need to stay hidden all the time?" "I've been here for many years and have never encountered inspectors like you two." "Are you trying to deceive me?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Lingtong chuckled, "How could that be? Children don't deceive children. If you don't believe me, let's make a pinky promise!" Yang Chanyu: ??</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Rudie Niang tilted her head, looked at him carefully, and then... extended her pinky finger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Yang Chanyu: ?!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The two made a pinky promise, and Sun Lingtong assured her of his genuine identity.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Rudie Niang agreed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Then, she let the two of them in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Yang Chanyu fell silent. She wasn't familiar with these intelligent mechanical constructs, but Sun Lingtong, having interacted with the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, knew the nature of such mechanisms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Though they possessed intelligence, it was limited, and they adhered strictly to certain principles.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This warehouse was quite cramped, distinctly different from the previous ones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">After scanning the area, Sun Lingtong transmitted a message to Yang Chanyu, his expression excited, "Yes, this is exactly what we're looking for!" Sun Lingtong took the lead, walking to the shelves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He reached out, took a can of tea leaves, and without opening the lid, simply sniffed around the canister, feeling an extreme sense of tranquility, as if walking among clouds, with a feeling of transcending the mundane.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">"This is premium Cloud Tea, a real treasure. Just a whiff brings such a wonderful sensation." "No wonder some people can comprehend the laws of the Cloud Dao after drinking it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong coughed and said to Rudie Niang, "Oh dear, the tea's aroma seems off. We'll take it out to air it, maybe it'll improve." Rudie Niang nodded, following closely beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Yang Chanyu carefully eyed the Myriad Cloud Seeds on the shelf.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">"To be specially placed here, displayed separately, these varieties are quite extraordinary." With anticipation and curiosity, Yang Chanyu collected all the Myriad Cloud Seeds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Seeing Rudie Niang staring at her with wide eyes, she coughed and said the Myriad Cloud Seeds seemed a bit yellowed and needed checking for illness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Rudie Niang responded with an "oh" and nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Yang Chanyu felt a pang of guilt seeing how easily Rudie Niang was deceived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Sun Lingtong opened a small jade bottle on his own.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He removed the stopper and peered inside with his large eyes, seeing three dew-like droplets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">"Virtuous Water, the supreme treasure of water. Finally found it!" He was extremely excited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ever since hearing Ning Zhuo's plan, Sun Lingtong had wanted to steal the Virtuous Water for him, and now he had finally achieved his goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">The two of them stole almost everything from the warehouse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The automaton followed them the entire time, dumbfoundedly asking, "Do all these goods have problems? I can't see anything wrong." Sun Lingtong's eyes darted as he turned to her, saying, "It's not just these goods that have problems, you have issues too. Come with us." "Huh?" Rudie Niang was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong, quick-witted, had many guesses about Rudie Niang's identity during the theft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Though Rudie Niang had intelligence, she was easily deceived and had no means to verify his and Yang Chanyu's identities. Thus, Sun Lingtong speculated she was actually one of the goods here, meant to be sold at an auction!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Sun Lingtong said, "Did you forget? We're the inspectors, right?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Isn't it normal for us to see your issues?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Rudie Niang pinched the hem of her dress, lowered her head, and asked nervously, "Then, may I ask, what issues do I have?" Sun Lingtong retorted, "If you can't even see the problems with these goods, isn't there something wrong with your eyes?" Rudie Niang was taken aback, touching her eyes before saying, "You make a good point." Yang Chanyu: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">She quietly watched Sun Lingtong perform, completely fooling the automaton.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">From the outside, Rudie Niang was extremely beautiful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">She had a human-like form, petite, about three feet tall, delicate and graceful, like a budding young girl.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Her face was as beautiful as a painting, her eyes clear, and her gaze gentle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">On her head was a butterfly-shaped silver crown, adorned with fine pearls and jade, light and ethereal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Behind her, a pair of wings extended, like a colorful butterfly, with thick black edges, giving a sense of resilience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">In the sunlight, the butterfly wings shimmered with iridescent colors, gently flapping, creating ripples in the air.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">She wore a plain silk long dress, with a jade belt around her waist.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">In her hand was a small jade bottle, intricately carved with floral patterns, with a milky fragrance emanating from the mouth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Rudie Niang's appearance was excellent, even Yang Chanyu, a woman, felt her heart skip a beat upon seeing her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Sun Lingtong had long set his eyes on this Wisdom Spirit Level automaton, thinking his little brother would surely love it!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Moreover, deceiving such a mechanism was a novel experience in his thieving career, providing him with amusement and excitement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">So, he continued, "Rudie Niang, quickly go into sleep mode. I'll put you in my bracelet and take you out for proper repairs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Rudie Niang stared blankly at Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu, her voice soft and sweet, "Are you really going to take me away?" Sun Lingtong widened his eyes, full of innocence, "Of course. It's our duty, and you're lucky to have met us." "Don't worry! We'll definitely fix your eyes once we take you out." Rudie Niang nodded, "I'm really grateful to you. You're a good person!" Sun Lingtong chuckled, glancing at Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Yang Chanyu rolled her eyes at his smug expression, speechless but impressed by Sun Lingtong's methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">But the next moment, Rudie Niang's expression suddenly changed, becoming extremely serious. Her eyes emitted a blue divine light, and her voice turned cold.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">"If you want to take me away, then please recite the secret code!" Sun Lingtong's eyes widened slightly, not expecting this turn of events, feeling quite shocked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Rudie Niang's gaze locked onto him, continuing, "Since you want to take me away and claim to be inspectors, you must know the secret code." "Now, please say it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Hahaha..." Yang Chanyu couldn't help but laugh at Sun Lingtong's predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Rudie Niang urged him, "Go ahead, say it now. Otherwise, you're a big liar, a bad person, and bad people must be punished!" As she spoke, the butterfly wings behind Rudie Niang shimmered slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The seven-colored radiance quickly spread, enveloping the entire warehouse space, transforming it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">In an instant, Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu found themselves surrounded by countless colorful glass shards.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">The edges of these shards glowed with seven colors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">"What kind of technique is this?!" Yang Chanyu's expression changed, secretly alarmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">She had been "deceived" by Rudie Niang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yang Chanyu had secretly probed Rudie Niang earlier, finding her main materials to be of the Foundation Establishment level, so she hadn't paid much attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">But now, she suddenly unleashed a quasi-Golden Core level spell, and it was cast instantly, with no prior signs of brewing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">This greatly surprised Yang Chanyu, making her extremely wary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Things have gotten a bit tricky!" Yang Chanyu observed again, making new discoveries.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The butterfly wings behind Rudie Niang were quite extraordinary, with layers of formations on the surface, previously unnoticeable. Now that they were activated, the formations were visible to the naked eye, astonishing Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">What kind of excellent mechanical technique could combine a bunch of Foundation Establishment level materials to unleash quasi-Golden Core level power?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Yang Chanyu glanced at Sun Lingtong, signaling him with her eyes, secretly agreeing to attack Rudie Niang together.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Sun Lingtong, however, gestured to Yang Chanyu to hold off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">His face was slightly pale, knowing he had overplayed his hand.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">They couldn't start a fight inside the Cloud Whale. If they alarmed the Cloud Whale, their situation would be dire, as the Cloud Whale was a Nascent Soul level lifeform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Sun Lingtong's heart pounded, cold sweat forming on his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">He licked his dry lips, continuing his performance, "The secret code, huh? Of course, I know it. Don't worry."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">"But the problem is, which code do you want?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Rudie Niang looked puzzled, "What do you mean? I only have one secret code." Sun Lingtong shrugged, spreading his hands, "For you, of course, there's only one secret code." "But not for us."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"We know too many secret codes, as we're inspectors. When encountering situations like yours, we have to use secret codes." "It's precisely because we know too many that we've kind of forgotten which secret code you need." Rudie Niang was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun Lingtong continued, "So can you tell me some details about the secret code? I need a reminder." Yang Chanyu: ...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Rudie Niang's expression changed, pondering, "What you said does make sense." "Then I'll tell you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"The secret code is, Cloud Fly, Cloud... Wait, wait!" "By directly telling you these code contents, aren't I just revealing the code to you?" She finally realized, glaring at Sun Lingtong with wide eyes, puffing her cheeks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Her aura kept rising, clearly about to make a move.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Sun Lingtong quickly waved his hand, "Wait, don't rush to act! I just asked for a reminder, not for you to directly tell me the secret code." Rudie Niang interrupted, "But you clearly just..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun Lingtong also interrupted her, "What I said earlier might not have been clear, and you misunderstood." "But none of that matters, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Look, I'm just a child. Isn't it normal for me to speak unclearly?" "You just need to give me some hints, that's all." "I didn't ask you to reveal the entire secret code." Rudie Niang tilted her head, gazing at Sun Lingtong, scrutinizing him up and down.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Sun Lingtong stared back with big, innocent eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">She was moved again, thinking such a child couldn't be deceitful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">But after pondering for a long time, she finally said, "Hmm... I still have some doubts about you, but I'm willing to give you one last chance." "The hint I'll give you is that the secret code is a nursery rhyme."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">Sun Lingtong exclaimed, "A nursery rhyme..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Looks like it's still not working. Let's not waste time, Sun Lingtong, let's act together!" Yang Chanyu secretly transmitted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong's eyes suddenly brightened, gesturing to Yang Chanyu to hold off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"I've got it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Thank you for the hint. I know what your secret code is." "Just listen to me sing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The next moment, Sun Lingtong cleared his throat and began to sing softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Cloud, Cloud Fly</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Crossing mountains and green peaks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Streams babble around big trees,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Sunlight bathes the green grass mounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">.....</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Clouds fly, winds chase, flying over rivers and starlight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The vast sky and distant earth are splendid,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Clouds roll and clouds unfold, let the wind blow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Clouds fly, hearts weary, flying over rainbows and rosy clouds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The sky's glow gradually fades,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The moon's shadow quietly reflects the dark night.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Clouds fly, dreams return, flying over longing and sorrow.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Mother dreams of holding you home,</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Returning to the hometown for peaceful sleep.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Rudie Niang's expression softened, bowing deeply to Sun Lingtong, "I apologize for doubting you. Please take me out." "No problem, no problem," Sun Lingtong smiled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">The next moment, Rudie Niang closed her eyes and truly went into sleep mode.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Sun Lingtong decisively placed her into his storage bracelet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Now, Yang Chanyu looked at him with newfound respect!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Before this journey, she had assumed she would be the main force. Unexpectedly, Sun Lingtong's performance repeatedly surprised her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Yang Chanyu, filled with curiosity, directly asked, "How did you know that nursery rhyme?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Sun Lingtong chuckled, "It's the most widely spread nursery rhyme in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, often used by mothers as a lullaby."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Yang Chanyu pressed, "How do you know it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles. Many things can't be learned just from books." Sun Lingtong chuckled, his gaze momentarily distant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">......</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">A two or three-year-old Ning Zhuo huddled under the covers, crying softly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Sun Lingtong approached the bed, curiously asking why he was crying and not sleeping.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Little Ning Zhuo peeked his head out from under the covers, "I, I miss my mother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Sun Lingtong felt a headache coming on. He wanted to say something comforting but stammered, unable to articulate it well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The more Little Ning Zhuo spoke, the sadder he became, tears streaming down, "I, I can't sleep. Whenever I can't sleep, my mother sings to me. Can you sing to me?" Sun Lingtong's mouth twitched, thinking, "I'm a dignified demonic cultivator, how could I... uh." He was defeated by Little Ning Zhuo's eager, longing eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"Alright, alright. What song should I sing? I don't know any..." "It's okay, I can teach you. Cloud Fly, Cloud Fly..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Sun Lingtong sighed deeply, "Alright, I'll sing it once. You better sleep quickly, understand?" Little Ning Zhuo nodded weakly from under the covers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Sun Lingtong sat by the bed, his hands naturally resting, slightly leaning, suppressing a sense of embarrassment, and sang softly, "Cloud Fly, Cloud..." "Sunlight bathes the green grass mounds..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Little Ning Zhuo suddenly interrupted, "You sang it wrong, it's grass mounds, not grass hangs." "Oh, oh. I'll start over... What was the beginning again?" After many stops and corrections, he finally finished singing, albeit clumsily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Sun Lingtong was drenched in sweat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Why aren't you asleep yet?" He looked at Little Ning Zhuo's bright, spirited eyes, feeling uneasy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Little Ning Zhuo frowned, troubled, "When my mother sings, it's not like this. Her singing is smooth, her voice light and gentle. You singing like this makes it even harder for me to sleep." Sun Lingtong: "Then I'll sing it again."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">........</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Inside the Cloud Whale.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Yang Chanyu's voice pulled Sun Lingtong's mind back to reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">She wasn't easily fooled, curiously saying, "Reading ten thousand books, traveling ten thousand miles, that's indeed a good principle." "But aren't you a bit too familiar with this nursery rhyme?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">"Even if you heard it from someone, you couldn't possibly remember it so accurately and fluently, right?" "It feels like you've sung it many times..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Sun Lingtong's mouth twitched, "How could that be?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">"Let's not talk about this."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">"We've got what we came for, let's proceed to the next step!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Several days later.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Atop Fire Persimmon Mountain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Ning Zhuo and others gathered there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Zhu Xuanji and others stood guard nearby.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">The group cast spells to conceal their presence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="281">Then, Meng Kui personally attacked, slaughtering the beasts besieging the Lava Immortal Palace, drawing them away to create a gap in the formation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">"Now's the time!" Zhu Xuanji and others led Ning Zhuo's group, successfully approaching the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="285">Once within a certain distance, the palace emitted beams of treasure light, drawing everyone inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="287">The treasure light's defense was formidable, rendering the beasts' attacks futile even if they noticed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="289">"Entering the Immortal Palace... finally inside!" Ning Zhuo's plan succeeded. Zhu Xuanji and the others' actions were within his expectations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="291">"Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo, he's finally here." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was overjoyed. During this time, Ning Xiaohui's progress was remarkable, her contributions nearing the success standard, almost ready to join the Historical Records Pavilion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="293">"Little Zhuo is here, I need to find an opportunity to secretly give him the Virtuous Water." Sun Lingtong, with Yang Chanyu's help, had infiltrated the Immortal Palace a day earlier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="295">It must be said, the Void Sect's stealth techniques were indeed unparalleled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="297">The commotion of Ning Zhuo and others entering the palace drew the attention of the cultivators already stationed there.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="299">Ning Xiaohui led the Ning family cultivators to greet them proactively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="301">Her eyes flickered, her emotions complex, "Even if you've entered the Immortal Palace, you can't match my achievements! Here, I'm the leader, and you're all the followers!" She scanned the crowd, her gaze lingering on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
