<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 75: Cause and Effect</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">“You go on ahead, I’ll head back for a moment.” Zhu Xuanji turned back midway.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Fei Si quickly said, “I’ll go with you, let’s go!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The Zhou Clan old ancestor naturally refused to fall behind and followed closely. “Divine Investigator Zhu, did you discover something?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Zhu Xuanji merely shook his head.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Before long, the three returned the Flying Disk Workshop. Several cultivators from the workshop were busy repairing the roof.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Zhu Xuanji waved his hand, and the roof was lifted off once again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The three Golden Cores slowly descended.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“Ah, three Sirs!” Ning Zhuo and Chen Cha bowed once more.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Zhu Xuanji ignored the duo and walked directly to Yuan Dasheng’s corpse, then pulled out a medicine bottle from his robe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">The moment he uncorked it, a fragrant medicinal aroma spread out, causing a collective jolt in everyone’s hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Fei Si cried out, “Top-grade medicinal liquid?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Top-grade medicine was extremely rare. Each one required a perfect harmonization of timing, location, and human effort to be successfully refined, and couldn’t be easily reproduced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Zhu Xuanji looked deadly serious. To verify his thoughts, he had no qualms in using up such a treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">All eyes were on him as he carefully poured out a single drop of medicinal liquid.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The liquid fell onto Yuan Dasheng’s corpse and immediately seeped in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Zhu Xuanji and the others waited for a while, but no changes appeared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Zhu Xuanji let out a sigh. “The old ape did not have its mind influenced by an external force recently. That explosion in Fire Persimmon Forest really was due to its own mistake.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Fei Si’s expression fell, as if to say, that’s all?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Zhou Clan old ancestor simply nodded slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Zhu Xuanji didn’t even glance at the others before turning and flying off.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Fei Si and the Zhou Clan old ancestor followed behind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After the three Golden Cores left, Ning Zhuo and Chen Cha resumed their work on Yuan Dasheng’s corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Chen Cha noticed Ning Zhuo’s slow movements, pale face, and feeble breath, and couldn’t help but express some concern. “Little Zhuo, these past few days you’ve had to hurriedly produce mechanism monkeys, participate in the Fire Persimmon Festival, follow Fei Si’s orders, and force Yuan Er to hand over Yuan Dasheng. In the end, you also faced the pressure of three Golden Core masters twice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">“You’ve worked too hard. Go home and get some rest. I’ll take care of this.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Zhuo forced a bitter smile and waved his hand, wiping the fine sweat from his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Let me catch my breath first.” He stopped what he was doing, found a stool, and sat down to rest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">A strong sense of lingering fear surged up inside him, and cold sweat again beaded on his forehead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">The situation just now had been extremely dangerous!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">“That was too close…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Right after he extracted the blood from Yuan Dasheng’s body, the three Golden Cores had arrived and investigated the corpse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Later, they returned again. If Ning Zhuo had truly used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal to influence Yuan Dasheng, he would’ve met a terrible end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Looking back a few days prior…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">For the sake of surviving this life-and-death crisis, Ning Zhuo was racking his brain and exhausting every possible idea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Yuan Dasheng was too powerful!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">It was also guarded by the Monkey Head Gang.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Fighting directly would be the worst option.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">“If I want to kill with a borrowed knife, I’ll have to expose Yuan Dasheng to another faction…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Putting aside the problem of manipulating others into fighting the Monkey Head Gang, doing so might lead to somebody discovering Yuan Dasheng’s true value. If that happened, Ning Zhuo would have really shot himself in the foot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">And the biggest issue was Zhu Xuanji, who wielded the Root Tracking Origin Tracing Incantation!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">If Ning Zhuo used Buddha Heart Demon Seal to directly influence Yuan Dasheng, Zhu Xuanji would only need to trace the corpse to find the one most closely linked — Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">That would be equivalent to turning himself in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">“How can I save myself?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo pondered bitterly, wracking his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">He plunged into the abyss of deep thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">A strong sense of loneliness enveloped him, making him feel as though he’d been abandoned by the entire world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">No one knew his true situation. He had no one to confide in, no one to rely on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Cold and cruel destiny had placed a powerful foe like Yuan Dasheng before him, forcing him into a deadly trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ultimately, he had no choice but to fight alone!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">While devising a countermeasure, intense emotions inevitably rose up within him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Helplessness, powerlessness, disappointment, despair, thirst for survival, anger, hatred, unwillingness to betray his mother’s final wishes, an urge to rebel against fate…</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo had to constantly guard against these emotions, eliminate them, and do his best to think calmly and objectively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He had to find possibility within impossibility!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">And he had to succeed in one strike, with utmost thoroughness. Any flaw in the plan would inevitably burn him later on and lead to his downfall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“I still haven’t figured out several key pieces of intel.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“For example, how did Yuan Dasheng obtain the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique? What level has it cultivated to?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Wait a minute… Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">In the midst of his thoughts, Ning Zhuo paused, then his eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Yes, the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Once activated, this demonic technique could draw out blood energy and condense it into blood sinews.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">When targeting the self, it could enhance mobility and improve defensive strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">When targeting others, it could use the cultivator’s own blood energy to pollute the blood energy of the target. Once there were enough blood sinews inside and around the target’s body, the target’s movements could be restricted or even controlled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">At that moment, Ning Zhuo felt as if he saw a ray of light shining out of endless darkness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">“I can use blood energy to infiltrate and influence Yuan Dasheng.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“Of course, it can’t be my blood energy. If foreign blood energy infiltrated, Yuan Dasheng would definitely sense it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“But I can use its own blood energy!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo obviously couldn’t draw blood from Yuan Dasheng itself. However, the latter had plenty of monkey descendants!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Even though these monkey descendants also have their respective mothers’ blood, if I collect enough of them, I can use alchemical methods to refine and extract the blood energy closest to Yuan Dasheng’s own.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">As Ning Zhuo thought of this, he encountered another question — would Yuan Dasheng be able to detect this blood energy of the same origin?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Could it be so perceptive?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo thought deeply and concluded that the possibility was low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Yuan Dasheng cultivates two techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"One is the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique. I don’t know where it got it, but it’s cultivated to at least the fourth level of Essence Refining.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"The other is the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation, obtained from the Technique Transmission Bell. It’s cultivated to the peak of the third level of Qi Refining, allowing Yuan Dasheng’s soul to enter the immortal palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Apart from these, it couldn’t have cultivated any other technique."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">To enter the immortal palace during the Qi Refining stage, a cultivator wasn’t allowed to practice any cultivation technique aside from the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Incantation, Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation, and Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">They had to reach the peak of the third level of Qi Refining with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation in order to trigger the soul entry mechanism.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">If Yuan Dasheng knew another technique, it could only be the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Incantation. Naturally, that would mean that it had Spirit Refining cultivation, and thus would be displayed on the ranking list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">But right now, the only name on the Spirit Refining ranking was Ning Zhuo’s alias.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“If it doesn’t have a Spirit Refining technique, relying on five elements magical power and the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique alone won’t grant it such keen perception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“According to my information, Yuan Dasheng isn’t skilled at wielding magic artifacts and prefers to make full use of its physical power in close combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Since that’s the case, this should be a fair bet."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Ning Zhuo had no other choice. He could only bet that Yuan Dasheng wouldn’t notice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
