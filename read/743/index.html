<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Zhuo's arrival at a branch of the Universal Commerce Hall immediately drew attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Who's that young man?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"That must be Ning Zhuo. One of the top newcomers to emerge from this year's Flying Cloud Assembly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Many cultivators cast curious glances, whispering among themselves or communicating through divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Zhuo approached the counter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The cultivator on duty behind the counter felt his heart race. He quickly stepped forward, greeting him warmly: "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, are you looking to buy or sell something? If you wish to make a discreet purchase, we can communicate through divine sense. I assure you, I'll keep your secrets safe!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "Thank you, but that won't be necessary. I'm here to purchase some Confucian cultivator spells."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">He chose to communicate verbally rather than through divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Seeing Ning Zhuo's lack of arrogance despite his genius, the on-duty cultivator felt a sense of familiarity and nodded eagerly. "I know you've won first place in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial for Confucian cultivators twice in a row. What kind of Confucian spells are you looking for? I'll find them for you right away. Or perhaps you have something specific in mind?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"What ideas do you have? I can offer some humble suggestions."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"That would be wonderful! Thank you!" Ning Zhuo's smile widened. "I'm still quite unfamiliar with Confucian cultivation. On this trip, I'd like to purchase some spells that can help me impart knowledge to others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">The on-duty cultivator flinched slightly, surprised by Ning Zhuo's request.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Ning Zhuo was participating in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial, so shouldn't he be focused on learning himself, rather than studying methods for teaching others?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">He's a top-tier genius, the cultivator thought. Naturally, his thinking is beyond the comprehension of ordinary people like us.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">With that, the cultivator immediately accessed the records and quickly recommended several spells to Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This was the golden age of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Dozens of Confucian cultivation spells were available. After careful consideration, Ning Zhuo selected eight:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Standing in the Snow at the Master's Gate, Discipline Ruler Technique, Broad Enlightenment Technique, Collective Enlightenment Technique, Strict Teacher's Rigorous Training, Incentive Whip of Merit, Successor of the Mantle and Bowl Passing on the Sacred Flame</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Ning Zhuo's current foundation in Confucian cultivation was insufficient to cast the Standing in the Snow at the Master's Gate spell directly. However, he could use a related array to assist in its execution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">The Formation, now complete, would aid in the success of the Confucian Technique. If successful, the target cultivator would instantly grasp the imparted knowledge, crossing the threshold and entering the inner sanctum of understanding.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The Discipline Ruler Technique required the use of a specific Magic Artifact - a Discipline Ruler. By striking with the Ruler, the cultivator could impart useful knowledge to the student.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Collective Enlightenment Technique was a Confucian ritual. The cultivator would receive tuition fees from students through portraits of Confucian sages, then bestow upon them a particular wisdom or skill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"I'll take all of these," Ning Zhuo said, producing Spirit Stones and paying on the spot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Having inherited Qing Huangzi's legacy, he had acquired a substantial cache of Spirit Stones for daily expenses, finally escaping the awkward situation of relying solely on his Ghost Path Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Farewell," Ning Zhuo said, calmly departing the Trading Hall under the watchful eyes of the attending cultivator and other patrons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">---</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="52">Ban Jie sat by the window on the second floor of a tavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="54">A Flying Message landed before her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="56">"Ning Zhuo's visit to the Universal Commerce Hall was merely to purchase some Confucian Techniques?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="58">Ban Jie examined the information more closely, her brow furrowing slightly. "Why are these all methods for imparting knowledge to others? What... what is the purpose of this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="60">As the Ban Clan's emergency envoy, Ban Jie found this intelligence puzzling and incomprehensible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="62">"Never mind that for now. Where is Ning Zhuo?" Ban Jie stroked the jade pendant at her waist, contacting her subordinates.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="64">Her subordinates, who had been monitoring Ning Zhuo's movements, immediately responded. The intelligence, relayed through multiple layers of communication, quickly reached Ban Jie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="66">Thus, Ban Jie successfully intercepted Ning Zhuo midway through his journey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="68">"Fellow Daoist Ning, please wait," Ban Jie called out, blocking the path. "I am Ban Jie, a cultivator of the Ban Clan."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="70">Ban Jie took the initiative to perform the Rites, introducing herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="72">She deliberately spoke loudly, knowing that a bustling market was being held on a nearby mountain peak to the southeast. The crowd surged, shoulder to shoulder, their voices rising in a clamor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="74">Sensing Ban Jie's commotion, many cultivators immediately turned their attention to the scene.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="76">"Look! It's Ning Zhuo!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="78">"Ban Jie? The Ban Clan has sent someone? And they're confronting Ning Zhuo? Are they going to teach this outsider a lesson?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="80">"Let's go! This is going to be good!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="82">"There have been rumors that Ban Ji, driven by jealousy and envy, secretly hired Demonic Cultivators to harass Ning Zhuo. Now, the Ban Clan has even sent someone here."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="84">Many cultivators grew excited, some casting detection spells while others simply summoned floating clouds and left their mountain peaks, heading toward the location of Ning Zhuo and Ban Jie.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="86">Ning Zhuo sized up Ban Jie, noting her Hundred-Refined Heaven inner armor, a robe of autumn-fragrant cloud-patterned silk, and a four-layered amber-threaded veil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="88">Her eyebrows were thin and sharp as blades, and at her temples, two Profound Copper eyebrow studs rotated imperceptibly, like tiny gears.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="90">A glint of sharp insight flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes, and he immediately grew wary. He quickly scanned the crowd of cultivators gathering to watch the spectacle, then snorted coldly. "Ban Jie? What brings you here?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="92">Ban Jie's face revealed a perfectly calibrated expression of sorrow and sincerity. "During the recent turmoil, my brother Ban Ji was framed! The claim that he hired Demonic Cultivators is nothing but a vile scheme by petty villains seeking to incite conflict between the Ban and Ning Clans. Their motives are despicable! The Ban Clan is a noble and reputable family; we would never stoop to such tactics. Unless this misunderstanding is resolved, both our clans will suffer, and the Righteous Path will be disgraced!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="94">At this point, Ban Jie surveyed the entire assembly before fixing his gaze on Ning Zhuo. "Today, Ban Jie presents herself here, carrying the goodwill of my clan elders, to offer these humble gifts as a token of sincerity. I sincerely hope to resolve our misunderstanding with Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo and transform enmity into harmony."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="96">"Fellow Daoist, your insights into mechanisms and the profound mysteries of the Five Elements are truly exceptional. With a heart like the Qin and courage like a sword, your noble spirit shines like jade, making you a model for our generation and naturally inspiring admiration and a desire for friendship."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="98">"It is far better to resolve conflicts than to perpetuate them, to turn swords into jade and strife into peace - a tale of beauty. Perhaps one day, united in purpose and virtue, we might even walk the path of the Great Dao together. Such a vision is not mere fantasy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="100">Upon hearing these words, the cultivators from the National Observatory exchanged glances and communicated through divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="102">"The Ban Clan is actually taking the initiative to resolve their misunderstanding with Ning Zhuo?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="104">"Ning Zhuo may appear solitary, but his clan's influence extends beyond the Flying Cloud Kingdom. The Ban Clan's move is quite shrewd."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="106">"I always knew the Ban Clan's principles wouldn't allow them to associate with Demonic Cultivators. It turns out this was all a cunning scheme by others!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="108">Ning Zhuo frowned, about to speak, but Ban Jie, keenly observing his expression, decisively interrupted him. With a swift tap on the storage pouch at his waist, he released the gifts he had brought for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="110">Gifts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="112">Instantly, a radiant treasure light erupted, its brilliance swirling and drawing in spiritual energy and Qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="114">A dozen precious artifacts were lifted by an invisible force, suspended between Ban Jie and Ning Zhuo, their mere sight causing onlookers' hearts to tremble.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="116">The cultivators gasped in unison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="118">"Am I seeing things? That bottle seems to contain Nine Heavens Profound Ice Essence! The Ban Clan is giving away three drops of such an extremely cold treasure!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="120">"An Earthfire Lotus Seed? This spiritual plant is incredibly rare. Legend says that if cultivated properly, it can extinguish Fire Seeds!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="122">"Look at that massive Void Array Spirit Stone! It's a top-tier material for constructing teleportation arrays or forging spatial magic treasures!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="124">Even Ning Zhuo couldn't help but be drawn in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="126">His gaze fell upon a treasure tower among the gifts. The exquisite, translucent nine-tiered pagoda rotated silently. Its surface was covered in a dense network of profound magnetic threads and miniature gears, subtly aligning with the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, its precision leaving him mesmerized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="128">Ban Jie introduced it at the opportune moment: "This is the Profound Magnetic Thousand-Mechanism Nine-Twist Treasure Tower. The treasures hidden within are often exceptionally rare and precious - otherwise, such elaborate storage methods wouldn't be necessary."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="130">She pointed to a piece of jade: "This is Ten-Thousand-Year Azure Void Divine Wind Jade."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="132">Her finger moved to a crystalline spirit egg: "This is an Azure Window Egg. Hatching it will yield an excellent mount."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="134">Finally, she presented an ancient beast-hide scroll: "This contains the Heavenly Evolution Myriad Transformations Beast Spirit Contract. Once mastered, it allows you to forge contracts with any demonic beast, binding them to your service. Even if the beast dies in battle, there's a chance it will become a Beast Spirit, continuing to serve you."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="136">Ning Zhuo's brow furrowed deeper, while the surrounding cultivators grew increasingly agitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="138">"Heavens! The Ban Clan is truly going all out! This is no mere token gift!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="140">"Nine Heavens Profound Ice Bone! Earthfire Lotus Seed! Void Stone! My Dao Heart... I've never seen such treasures in my life!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="142">"The Ban Clan's generosity is astounding! They're willing to pay such a price to prove their innocence. But Ning Zhuo himself is indeed worthy of such attention."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="144">Ban Jie fixed her gaze on Ning Zhuo, scrutinizing every slight change in expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="146">Ning Zhuo, she murmured inwardly, such extraordinary gifts are within your reach. Just one word, and they're all yours. I refuse to believe you're unmoved!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="148">"If you accept these gifts, the Ban Clan will finally have the righteous standing we've sought!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="150">"By accepting these benefits, the ancestral shrine's Clan Pivot Chain will be activated, allowing them to target your Qi once more!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="152">How could Ning Zhuo possibly accept these treasures from the Ban Clan without paying a terrible price? A price that would remain almost imperceptible to outsiders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="154">"Heh," Ning Zhuo chuckled softly, his eyes flashing with cold starlight. His gaze, sharp as a blade, fell upon Ban Jie's face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="156">"Fellow Daoist Ban Jie, the Ban Clan... truly offers a grand gift of sincerity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="158">"This Nine Heavens Profound Ice has nothing to do with my Five Elements Circulation. It's not needed for balancing the Five Elements. Storing it would require vast quantities of Pure Yang and Wood-attribute Heavenly Materials and Earthly Treasures to construct a special sealing formation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="160">"The Earthfire Lotus Seed naturally grows deep underground, within magma. Cultivating it would demand massive investments of Fire Element resources and a protracted, time-consuming process."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="162">"The larger the Void Array Spirit Stone, the more difficult it is to use. Any disruption to its internal stability during array formation will trigger a self-detonation, collapsing space and plunging me into the Void - leaving me with no place to rest my bones!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="164">"And this Profound Magnetic Thousand-Mechanism Nine-Twist Treasure Tower? How much time and effort would it take to unravel its mysteries and claim the treasures within?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="166">"As for the Heavenly Evolution Myriad Transformations Beast Spirit Contract, judging by its ancient appearance, it's likely an archaic method. Do you expect me to spend years studying it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="168">"How long?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="170">"Did you go to the trouble of sending me a Qingwan Egg specifically to motivate me to cultivate this ancient technique?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="172">Ning Zhuo's insightful remark silenced the assembled cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="174">Exposed, Ban Jie remained unfazed, shaking her head repeatedly. "Fellow Daoist Ning, you've misunderstood the Ban Clan deeply. You've fallen for the lies of malicious individuals."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="176">"These gifts were carefully selected from our clan's treasury. Even if you don't use them yourself, selling them to the Universal Commerce Hall would bring you a substantial profit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="178">"The Ten-Thousand-Year Azure Void Divine Wind Jade within nourishes the Divine Soul and clears the mind, making it an invaluable treasure for comprehending Wind Movement and Space. It's inherently beneficial and harmless. Why would you twist its purpose?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="180">Only Ban Jie knew the full truth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="182">These gifts were indeed "carefully selected," each carrying hidden flaws. While Ning Zhuo's assessment contained minor inaccuracies, his overall assessment was largely correct.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="184">The Ten-Thousand-Year Azure Void Divine Wind Jade also had a flaw. Its Wind Movement principles were so potent that cultivators who attempted to comprehend them risked becoming completely immersed, allowing the principles to invade their bodies and minds. Unable to fully digest and master the jade's essence, their foundations would be corrupted - a fate worse than having their cultivation scattered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="186">Ning Zhuo snorted coldly, his gaze piercing Ban Jie like lightning. "Hypocritical and utterly deceitful!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="188">"Ban Ji hired Demonic Cultivators to assassinate me. I have ample evidence, but I refuse to be distracted by such matters at present."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="190">"Once the Flying Cloud Assembly concludes, I will reveal everything publicly and confront the Ban Clan directly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="192">"You tried to obstruct me halfway, attempting to bribe me with lavish gifts to distract me and lead me astray, leaving me no time for other matters!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="194">"This scheme is truly insidious."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="196">Ning Zhuo raised his voice, his gaze sweeping across the crowd. He declared, "As the Confucian sage said, 'To receive without giving in return is contrary to the Rites!'"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="198">"The Ban Clan has repeatedly harmed me. Do you take me for an ignorant child?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="200">"This is utterly outrageous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="202">"I, Ning Zhuo, hereby vow to retaliate against Ban Ji with all my might. I will not rest until I've beaten him to tears, reduced him to begging for his mother, and sent him fleeing like a cornered wolf!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="204">"I ask all present to bear witness to this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="206">Ning Zhuo knew there were likely Ban Clan plants in the crowd, but most were probably bystanders.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="208">The cultivators stared at him, their eyes wide with astonishment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="210">"I never expected Ning Zhuo to be so resolute!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="212">"He's being reckless. He's not just challenging Ban Ji, but the entire Ban Clan. What backing does he possibly have?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="214">"Speaking of which, could Ban Jie's gifts have been offered with malicious intent?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="216">After finishing his speech, Ning Zhuo shot Ban Jie a cold glance and soared away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="218">Ban Jie suppressed her fury and called out repeatedly, but Ning Zhuo ignored her, watching helplessly as the young man strode away, his sleeves billowing behind him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="220">A twitch finally flickered at the corner of Ban Jie's eye.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="222">"This brat actually remained unmoved by such lavish gifts!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="224">"I even reminded him he could sell it for money, but he still refused!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="226">Stubborn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="228">Ban Jie's first clash with Ning Zhuo ended in defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="230">"But I have more tricks up my sleeve. Hmph, just you wait, Ning Zhuo!" Ban Jie glared at Ning Zhuo's retreating figure, her heart seething with murderous intent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="232">--------</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">Star Point Peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Council Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">Yan Linglong stood beside Situ Xing and spoke softly, �Leader Situ, as the saying goes, to repel the external, one must first bring peace within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">�It is a great blessing that we have produced two top talents in succession.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">�But Ning Zhuo has not taken a seat among the ranks, and today everyone is talking about it. Could it be that he looks down on us?�</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">�You sit in the first chair, followed by Lin Jinglong and Shen Xi. Yet Ning Zhuo doesn�t even have a single chair. He took the stone tablet, his name spread far and wide, and he has never even met you in person.�</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">�If this situation continues, I�m afraid everyone will start to feel a bit uneasy.�</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Situ Xing frowned deeply, gazing out the window in thought. �Indeed,� he said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">�The seating of chairs is our rule, yet Ning Zhuo ignores it. Every moment he stays outside our order, he erodes that rule.�</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">�What do you think should be done?�</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Yan Linglong smiled faintly. Knowing Situ Xing�s temperament well, she deliberately replied, �It�s quite simple. Leader Situ might send him a letter � speak kindly and persuade him gently, and arrange for Ning Zhuo to take the second chair.�</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Situ Xing�s frown deepened further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Sensing the timing was right, Yan Linglong excused herself under the pretext of cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Back in her own cave residence, secluded and alone, she sent out a flying message to Ban Jie:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">�What you asked of me, I have done. Between Situ Xing and Ning Zhuo, there will soon be a battle!�</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
