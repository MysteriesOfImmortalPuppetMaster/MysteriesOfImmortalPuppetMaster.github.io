<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 418: The Celestial City of Green Forest.</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">After correcting the map, Sun Lingtong discovered that when they previously used void teleportation to escape, they had already left the Ten Thousand Peaks Forest area and arrived in the Two-Note Country.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Checking their status, the fire essence reserves had reached a critical level. The remaining amount could only power one more void teleportation, and even then, the teleportation time would be short, not allowing them to travel far.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">With such low fire essence reserves, if they returned to their previous state, they might still be within the Ten Thousand Peaks Forest's range and be sensed by the Blood Shadow Cave Master, who could then pursue them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">They needed to find a way to remove the Blood Shadow Cave Master's tracking methods. The Ten Thousand Li Dragon itself had suffered from the Demon Heart Cave Master's attack and needed repairs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">More importantly though, there was Sun Lingtong's current injury condition.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sun Lingtong's previous strategy was correct - to heal the injury, they needed to know the specific details and gain a clearer understanding of the Stone Elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Although their infiltration of the Six Cave Sect's mountain Sect unexpectedly revealed important intelligence about the mechanical carriage, they hadn't gained much additional information about the Stone Elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">As for why the Demon Heart Cave Master discovered them, Ning Zhuo later guessed it was likely because he had planted the Life Hanging by a Thread on the hooded black-robed cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Zhuo had indeed gained many advantages through this divine ability. These advantages could easily create the illusion that the divine ability was invincible.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Now, after the incidents with Ling He Jiu and the Demon Heart Cave Master, Ning Zhuo had gradually come to understand the true strength of the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">"Although this divine ability came from the Three Sect Master, if it were truly invincible, the South Bean Nation's territory would be much larger than it is now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Following Ning Zhuo's suggested destination, the Ten Thousand Li Dragon set off again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Although they didn't use void teleportation, the Ten Thousand Li Dragon's normal flight speed was still considerable.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After about half a day, the two approached their destination - the Celestial City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">As human activity gradually increased, about thirty li from the celestial city, Ning Zhuo was the first to fly out of the mechanical dragon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Sun Lingtong remained in the dragon head cabin, as he needed to constantly channel his spiritual power and try other methods to slow down the speed of the petrification.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">There weren't just humans, but also many bare-chested demon cultivators and rugged barbarians.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo still wore the Ten Thousand Li Dragon wrapped around his waist like a belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He walked forward on foot, crossing mountains and rivers with light movements.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Along the way, he encountered increasingly more cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">The demon cultivators generally wore minimal clothing - when they were beasts, they had always lived naked in nature. Even after becoming demon cultivators and gaining intelligence, most retained this habit.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Demon cultivators preferred loose, flowing clothing like robes and dresses, and many particularly favored cloaks and capes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Their clothes often had rich, colorful decorations including beast fur, gems, and flora, reflecting their closeness to nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The barbarians' attire was mostly beast hide, iron armor, or crudely woven grass and vines, sometimes even just scales.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Barbarians preferred deep red, earth yellow, emerald green, and black-grey colors.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">They generally believed red represented blood, earth yellow symbolized the ground, emerald green was for the mountains and forests, and black-grey was the state of all things after being burned to ash.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">This showed their reverence for battle, bloodline, bravery, and connection between individuals and nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Their clothing was much tighter than demon cultivators', suitable for combat. Trouser legs were bound with leather straps, and female barbarian clothing was even more simple and form-fitting, with a primitive beauty.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Ning Zhuo noticed they often carried axes, hammers, and bore spears and bows. The stronger their power and higher their status, the more decorations they wore. These decorations were mostly animal teeth, bones, and furs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Their necklaces, bracers and other accessories were all massive in size, as if bigger meant more glory and power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">These cultivators, like Ning Zhuo, were all headed to the Celestial City of Green Forest. Some hurried along silently, while others traveled in groups, chatting and laughing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo gazed at the Celestial City of Green Forest, which looked like an undulating river. The city's terrain was uneven, built among hills with buildings distributed to suit the landscape, creating a staggered effect.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Ning Zhuo could see the winding streets and clusters of buildings in the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Several military camps had been built beside the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">On the east side was one camp, heavily guarded with red flags flying and fierce qi rolling about, clearly practicing fire-attribute spells. The west camp's gates were wide open, with crowds of people flowing in and out, demon cultivators and barbarians mixed together, waves of clamor spreading outward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">More military camps could be vaguely seen in the distance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ten li from the city, restrictions took effect prohibiting cultivators from flying. To enter the city, they had to walk on solid ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Usually, it wasn't like this. But now was a special period, with Two-Note Country's army constantly gathering. The vanguard was already stationed at the foot of Ten Thousand Peaks Forest. Behind them were several important towns, and behind those was the Celestial City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">As the first celestial city closest to the Ten Thousand Peaks Forest battlefield, it would bear important rear area responsibilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Therefore, under military control, they had begun restricting air travel to strictly prevent spying and sneak attacks from above.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Ning Zhuo followed the flow of people to the city gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The city guard manned the gate, requiring fifty low-grade spirit stones from each person entering the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"If you're looking to join the army, you needn't enter the city! The military camps outside are all recruiting talent! Among them, the White Jade Camp offers the highest pay, twice that of the lowest-paying Red Flower Camp!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The city guard would shout this out from time to time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Sure enough, many cultivators entering the city heard the guard's reminder and left the queue, turning to head toward the military camps instead.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo paid the entry fee and officially stepped into the Celestial City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The city was full of lush vegetation, with colorful flowers and strange plants everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The city's houses curved and extended, distributed unevenly - though not orderly, it had its own charm. Ning Zhuo couldn't help but take a deep breath. The air he breathed was moist and warm, mixed with the fragrance of flowers and plants. Clearly, the climate here was very pleasant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Gradually moving away from the city gate, Ning Zhuo didn't head to the city center but instead ducked into narrow, winding side streets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Both sides of the streets were lined with ancient wooden buildings shaded by green trees. Various shops, teahouses, and restaurants - these buildings were almost all made of wood, with bamboo being particularly common. The roofs and walls were covered with woven grass or vines.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Zhuo quickly found a place selling intelligence reports.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Shortly after, he left the dark alley with several jade slips and went to a restaurant to check the purchased intelligence while eating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The intelligence was roughly divided into three parts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">One part concerned Ten Thousand Peaks Forest, one was about Two-Note Country's expedition army, and the last was about the Celestial City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">In the Ten Thousand Peaks Forest intelligence, the first thing Ning Zhuo saw was the Dragon Whisker King. This was Ten Thousand Peaks Forest's most powerful deity, with its true form being a dragon whisker ginseng. In Ten Thousand Peaks Forest, it possessed Soul Formation level combat power. It was openly the strongest enemy that the dynasty's expedition army would face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Beyond that were the Six Cave Sect, White Elephant Herd, Moon Clan, Ancient Vine Tribe, Hundred Poisons Tribe... these powerful organizations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">In the expedition army, Ning Zhuo saw information about the vanguard, the entire army's marshal, and the four generals currently stationed near the Celestial City of Green Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">They were Lu Chi, Xu Dali, Shuang Jing, and Mu Lan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Among them, Lu Chi commanded the Fire Cloud Army - the camp Ning Zhuo had seen earlier where fire clouds burned as they practiced fire-attribute spells.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Xu Dali was a barbarian-demon hybrid who commanded the Barbarian Demon Army. This army lived up to its name, composed entirely of barbarians and demon cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Shuang Jing commanded the White Jade Army, currently stationed on the west side of the Celestial City of Green Forest. Ning Zhuo had entered through the east gate and hadn't seen it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">But he had heard the city guard encouraging outside cultivators to join the White Jade Army, as this army offered the highest pay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">In contrast was General Mu Lan's Red Flower Army, which according to intelligence was the smallest in scale and offered the lowest pay.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">There was another commander named Sun Gan, currently leading the elite Golden Halberd Army from the capital, due to arrive in a few days.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">The Golden Halberd Army was one of the imperial armies, and Sun Gan was one of the imperial army commanders. Though small in number, this army was particularly powerful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">The Two-Note Country ruler sending this army showed his determination to conquer Ten Thousand Peaks Forest!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">The intelligence about the Celestial City of Green Forest quickly helped Ning Zhuo understand this celestial city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The tallest building in the city was the Thousand Green Wooden Pagoda, a treasure incorporating thousands of types of wood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">There were two temples, the Tree God Temple and Beast King Temple.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">These two deities had received support from Two-Note Country over a hundred years ago. They were once minor gods, but now their faith had spread throughout Ten Thousand Peaks Forest.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">When the Two-Note Country ruler declared war on Ten Thousand Peaks Forest, these two major deities were allies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This showed that the Two-Note Country ruler had begun planning over a hundred years ago - this attack on Ten Thousand Peaks Forest was not a sudden decision but long premeditated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">"Found it! In the intelligence about the Stone Elder, it's rumored he began cultivation as a ten-thousand-year earth spirit, obtained a lucky encounter, and merged with a fragment of treasure-dividing rock. Thus he mastered a divine ability called Stone Casting Treasure."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"This divine ability could turn all things to stone, then use time to refine them, gradually transforming the stone into precious materials. These materials were mostly metals, jade, spirit ores, and such."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">At this point, Ning Zhuo had achieved his goal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Since Two-Note Country was launching a major expedition against Ten Thousand Peaks Forest, they must have done much research and gathered much intelligence about it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Now, since Sun and Ning temporarily couldn't approach Ten Thousand Peaks Forest, they would start by seeking information about the Stone Elder from its enemies.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Sun Lingtong frowned deeply: "Stone Casting Treasure? So it's a divine ability, no wonder I couldn't dispel it, and it's becoming harder to resist, because even spiritual power can be petrified."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Divine abilities are above spells, but wasn't the Stone Elder dead? Why can the divine ability still work?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Ning Zhuo shook his head: "The Stone Elder probably is dead. Whether from the Six Cave Sect or the Celestial City of Green Forest's intelligence, they all say this Stone Elder was at the Nascent Soul level."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">"He was probably in seclusion, attempting to break through to Soul Formation level, but failed and died."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"The divine ability he mastered is still working for unknown reasons. But I think the divine ability isn't actively taking effect, so its power isn't great."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Otherwise, with our small frames, we couldn't have lasted until now."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly: "Little Zhuo, you're right!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Sun Lingtong worried: "So, now that we know it's a divine ability at work, how do we solve it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Zhuo sighed: "This indeed exceeds our ability limit, we can only seek help from others. Intelligence says there's an extremely skilled physician in the Celestial City of Green Forest, named Iron Crutch Imperial Physician, who was once the Two-Note Country ruler's personal physician. We might as well seek his diagnosis first."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"Ah..." Sun Lingtong also had no better ideas, and could only say: "Being able to become an imperial physician is indeed impressive. Let's go see him then."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">So Ning Zhuo quickly finished his meal and packed another portion to take away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He delivered the food to the Ten Thousand Li Dragon for Sun Lingtong to eat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo constantly weaved through the alleys, crossing half of the Celestial City of Green Forest according to the intelligence, finally arriving at the Iron Yi Medical Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">The clinic's frontage wasn't large, and the entrance was deserted, not at all like the scene of a famous doctor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Ning Zhuo became somewhat doubtful, walking to the clinic entrance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">A small boy sat on a small stool inside the main door, and seeing Ning Zhuo, waved: "You're an outsider coming to seek treatment, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Yes." Ning Zhuo nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">"Can't see patients anymore, my master has decided to join the army. The clinic stopped operating yesterday, I'm the only one stationed here to inform people like you." The small boy delivered bad news.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">So Ning Zhuo asked further: "May I ask where Master Zhang is now?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Oh, he's in the military camp outside the city. But if you want to find him for treatment, it won't work. You must have heard of my master's personality, he's very stubborn."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Many people have already tried to find him in the military camp, none succeeded."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"In my opinion, if you need medical treatment, you might as well try finding other physicians."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Ning Zhuo nodded, thanked the small boy, and before leaving grabbed a handful of spirit stones to give him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"This is troublesome." Sun Lingtong said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">He had also read the intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">In the Celestial City of Green Forest, the strongest physician was definitely Zhang Zhongyi. Besides him, others were ordinary in ability, with little possibility of treating divine abilities.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">He left through the west gate of the Celestial City of Green Forest and saw two military camps almost side by side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"Let's go to the military camp to find him." Ning Zhuo still hadn't given up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The White Jade Army camp was magnificent and grand, with white jade stone walls encircling the tents. The chevaux de frise were tall, not ordinary wooden stakes but carved from white jade, covered in numerous talismans, with an aura as steady as mountains.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Watchtowers soared high, emitting strong light even in daytime, scanning the surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">On golden flagpoles flew the White Jade Army flags. The flags used brilliant white jade as the base, embroidered with silver-threaded dragon patterns, the dragon's eyes flickering as if ready to spread its wings and fly at any moment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">The camp gate was even more extravagant, made of two heavy white jade door panels, each inlaid with many high-grade spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">A group of cavalry galloped within the camp. Their movements were uniform, each warhorse equipped with exquisite white jade saddles, the seats inlaid with star-like brilliant gems, giving a noble impression.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
