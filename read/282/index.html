<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 282: The Palace Examination</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The ranking list for the palace examination was quickly leaked.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui, Zhu Xuanji, and others had no time to stop it, nor could they prevent it.<br/>
<br/>
The leak originated from the itinerant cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Once such explosive news spread, it immediately sparked widespread discussion within the Lava Immortal Palace and Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Even with the threat of the beast tide, countless people's attention was drawn to this news!<br/>
<br/>
"After the palace examination, the master of the Lava Immortal Palace will be decided, right?"<br/>
<br/>
"Once the Lava Immortal Palace has a master, it can unleash its full power and easily eradicate the beast tide, right?"<br/>
<br/>
"Speaking of which, the three sects are truly benevolent. This palace they set up is going to save Fire Persimmon Mountain again. The number of times the Lava Immortal Palace has done this over the years is countless!" Fei Si gritted his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
He stared at the entry criteria in the intelligence report, feeling a blatant mockery.<br/>
<br/>
"Void Sect, Sun Lingtong!" He silently remembered this grudge.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si prided himself on his strategy, and such a naked humiliation was rare for him.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, each such experience left a deep impression on him, even etched into his bones.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he noticed Ning Zhuo's ranking, which was ahead of Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
This made Fei Si's lips curl slightly: "This ambitious brat, he's really in the spotlight this time. You better be careful."<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si clearly had more empathy for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren threw the intelligence report to the ground, growling in frustration: "Bah! That cunning little brat actually made it into the final palace examination list. Why didn't I think of eliminating this scourge back then?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaoren had followed his father's plan, offering improved captives, and gained his freedom from the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
On the surface, he had been expelled from the Ning family, becoming a wandering cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Following the Ning family patriarch's guidance, Ning Xiaoren also entered the Lava Immortal Palace, trying hard to get close to Ning Zhuo and earn his forgiveness.<br/>
<br/>
But he failed; Ning Zhuo didn't even spare him a glance.<br/>
<br/>
This made Ning Xiaoren feel a deep humiliation, and his hatred for Ning Zhuo grew stronger.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Family Territory.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was so angry she wanted to tear the intelligence report to shreds.<br/>
<br/>
Her face twisted as she screamed, "Xiaohui, where is my Xiaohui? What is Ning Zhuo? How is he worthy of being on the ranking list? If he's there, Xiaohui must be ahead of him."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Xiaohui's grandmother pressed the report to her face, her eyes just a fingernail's distance from the paper.<br/>
<br/>
She searched hard, reading word by word, but found nothing.<br/>
<br/>
In her fury, she tore the report to pieces, hissing like a venomous snake: "Fake, fake, this report is fake! Hahaha!"<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace, Main Hall.<br/>
<br/>
The dragon turtle fire spirit was even weaker.<br/>
<br/>
Due to secretly interfering with the normal functioning of the Lava Immortal Palace, using the beast tide to destroy a core mechanical construct within the palace, it suffered another fire blade decapitation.<br/>
<br/>
After being severely injured a second time, the dragon turtle fire spirit's current state was less than fifty percent of its peak.<br/>
<br/>
Among the entire palace examination ranking list, it only paid attention to three people.<br/>
<br/>
One was Zhu Xuanji, after all, he was first, from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, and knew many secrets of the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Another was Meng Chong. The dragon turtle fire spirit always hoped he would inherit the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The last one was Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"How did Ning Zhuo sense the upcoming palace examination?"<br/>
<br/>
The dragon turtle fire spirit had too many matters to attend to, especially now, as the beast tide required more of its attention.<br/>
<br/>
So, recently, it had neglected Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
However, it had personally witnessed Ning Zhuo boldly offering the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.<br/>
<br/>
Such decisiveness and determination made the dragon turtle fire spirit feel a chill throughout its body.<br/>
<br/>
Facing this little monster, it grew increasingly fearful.<br/>
<br/>
"He must not be allowed to obtain the position of palace master."<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, if I can't escape, how will I live in the future?!"<br/>
<br/>
People began to speculate on who the ultimate victor of the palace examination would be. Who would laugh last and finally seize the Lava Immortal Palace?<br/>
<br/>
Most agreed that Zhu Xuanji was the first choice. He was ranked first, represented the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, and was renowned nationwide with exceptional strength.<br/>
<br/>
The public generally believed that the city lord's side was too weak. Just from the ranking list, only Meng Chong and some other Qi Refining juniors were present. But the true insiders knew that the Meng family's main force was in the second tier, eyeing the top three with ambition and ready to strike.<br/>
<br/>
The heated discussions had just begun when the first elimination occurred.<br/>
<br/>
To be precise, on the afternoon the list was announced, a corpse was discovered.<br/>
<br/>
It was an assassination.<br/>
<br/>
The heart of the corpse was destroyed, and the soul had vanished without a trace.<br/>
<br/>
This immediately reminded people of Zheng Jian, who had died in the same manner.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the blame was placed on Yang Chanyu!<br/>
<br/>
"Someone is impersonating me, starting to eliminate competitors. Hmph!" Being framed made Yang Chanyu feel quite displeased.<br/>
<br/>
But she didn't act, instead hiding deeper with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
They were in a dangerous situation now; once they showed themselves, they would surely be besieged.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Yang Chanyu was the focal point of concentrated attacks. But with the "entry criteria" revealed, Sun Lingtong attracted even more hatred than Yang Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the public believed that the top name in the palace examination would become the master of the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Many cultivators were envious. Even those not on the list harbored the hope that by eliminating those on the list, they might obtain it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Such an opportunity might come only once in a lifetime. So many were willing to take the risk and gamble!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had long gambled, staking his future on the righteous path, his name, his life, and even the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.<br/>
<br/>
"With the palace examination out, it's hard for me to find an opportunity to establish my foundation in a short time." Ning Zhuo sighed.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as he knew the list, he ran to Ning Jiufan's side.<br/>
<br/>
"Ancestor, it's terrifying. I'm also on the list, and I'm so scared, scared of being eliminated." Ning Zhuo made no effort to hide his desire for protection.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan scolded him for lacking backbone but still took him along.<br/>
<br/>
Not only Ning Zhuo, but Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and several others who were also on the list were brought by Ning Jiufan for protection.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, Zhu Xuanji gathered everyone in one place.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo noticed that not only Ning Jiufan, but the golden core ancestors of the Zhou and Zheng families also took their Qi Refining juniors with them for real-time protection.<br/>
<br/>
After all, they only had Qi Refining cultivation, too weak to protect themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, it was Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu from the Void Sect who might have acted maliciously. Now that the palace examination list was out, even righteous path cultivators could become murderers!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji considered this and once again gathered everyone, unifying the front, agreeing to cooperate as much as possible rather than engaging in internal strife early on.<br/>
<br/>
His proposal was immediately recognized and supported by the golden core cultivators of the three families.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji also instructed them: If possible, try to collect fragments and pieces of the golden furnace.<br/>
<br/>
He never let go of this crucial clue.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, the golden furnace was nearly inaccessible, a heavily guarded area of the Immortal Palace. Even trial disciples found it so.<br/>
<br/>
But now, with the scarlet flame beast tide covering the outer circle of the Immortal Palace, the assault on the inner area was constant.<br/>
<br/>
If the beast tide reached the golden furnace area, the defenses of the Lava Immortal Palace would inevitably relax, allowing cultivators to approach.<br/>
<br/>
"These broken bricks of the golden furnace have tracing back to the roots value." This was Zhu Xuanji's original statement.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was present, listening, and patiently admired how difficult this divine constable was. Even at the palace examination stage, he was still thinking about clues.<br/>
<br/>
"He might be hoping to use these clues to find Yang Chanyu and Boss Sun."<br/>
<br/>
"If that happens in the future, I'll have to use the Five Elements Cannon Tower to cleanse the area." Ning Zhuo reminded himself.<br/>
<br/>
The palace examination came faster than anyone expected.<br/>
<br/>
A teleportation circle and a piece of information appeared simultaneously—<br/>
<br/>
The first round of elimination begins.<br/>
<br/>
Candidates, please step into the light diagram, latecomers will be considered forfeiting.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone stepped into the light diagram without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, they found themselves in a vast plaza.<br/>
<br/>
In the plaza, tables and meditation mats were arranged.<br/>
<br/>
On each table were stacks of jade slips.<br/>
<br/>
Each cultivator was assigned to a table.<br/>
<br/>
They looked at each other, then at the table in front of them. Some impatient ones immediately sat cross-legged on the mats.<br/>
<br/>
New information was conveyed, and everyone knew: This was the first round of the examination, using a question-and-answer format to obtain scores.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the specific scores, the ranking list would be adjusted.<br/>
<br/>
The last ten on the list would be eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who attacked others, plotted, or attempted to cheat would be eliminated!<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, everyone became tense.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was especially so.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he was currently ranked last.<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, can you do it?" Yang Chanyu shouted at Sun Lingtong, "You're the last one." Her shout immediately drew everyone's attention.<br/>
<br/>
"Indeed!" In an instant, everyone confirmed their suspicions.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong glared at Sun Lingtong, this childlike demonic cultivator was playing with him!<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was filled with concern for Ning Zhuo, never looking in his direction, but laughing carelessly, expressing abundant confidence.<br/>
<br/>
The palace examination officially began.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's heart rate slightly accelerated as he quickly picked up a jade slip and placed it on his forehead to examine it.<br/>
<br/>
There were many questions, and he needed to imprint his answers on the jade slip with his divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyebrows twitched, his mood soaring.<br/>
<br/>
Question one: "Mirror unites yin and yang, observing inside and out." How does the "Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique" use the mirror to perceive, uniting yin and yang, to discern the truth of things? Please explain the path of spirit communication through the mirror, combining yin-yang transformations.<br/>
<br/>
Question two: "When the muscles are dyed, the bones are also firm." How does the "Demonic Blood Vein Technique" use the method of dyeing muscles and bones with blood to make them stand together, doubling strength? Please discuss its effect on cultivators, combining the relationship between muscles and bones.<br/>
<br/>
Question three: The Five Elements Transformation Disk contains one path of five elements mana each. What are the ways for a cultivator to, after neutralizing three paths of fire element spells, leave two paths of water and wood element mana each?<br/>
<br/>
Everyone: "The Demonic Blood Vein Technique is indeed one of the three sects' top methods, but the content of the fifth level of Qi Refining doesn't involve the level of dyeing muscles and bones with blood at all!" "And what is the Five Elements Transformation Disk?"<br/>
<br/>
"The 'Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique' is also one of the three sects' top methods! But I've never seen it!" "I'm doomed, doomed!"<br/>
<br/>
"Don't panic, stay calm. If I don't know, others won't either!" "Yes, yes, if everyone doesn't know, the final ranking won't change much. It won't!"</div>
