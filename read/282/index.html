<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 282: The Palace Examination</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The ranking list for the palace examination was quickly leaked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Meng Kui, Zhu Xuanji, and others had no time to stop it, nor could they prevent it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">The leak originated from the itinerant cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Once such explosive news spread, it immediately sparked widespread discussion within the Lava Immortal Palace and Fire Persimmon Immortal City.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Even with the threat of the beast tide, countless people's attention was drawn to this news!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">"After the palace examination, the master of the Lava Immortal Palace will be decided, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">"Once the Lava Immortal Palace has a master, it can unleash its full power and easily eradicate the beast tide, right?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">"Speaking of which, the three sects are truly benevolent. This palace they set up is going to save Fire Persimmon Mountain again. The number of times the Lava Immortal Palace has done this over the years is countless!" Fei Si gritted his teeth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He stared at the entry criteria in the intelligence report, feeling a blatant mockery.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"Void Sect, Sun Lingtong!" He silently remembered this grudge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Fei Si prided himself on his strategy, and such a naked humiliation was rare for him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Therefore, each such experience left a deep impression on him, even etched into his bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Then, he noticed Ning Zhuo's ranking, which was ahead of Meng Chong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">This made Fei Si's lips curl slightly: "This ambitious brat, he's really in the spotlight this time. You better be careful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Fei Si clearly had more empathy for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Ning Xiaoren threw the intelligence report to the ground, growling in frustration: "Bah! That cunning little brat actually made it into the final palace examination list. Why didn't I think of eliminating this scourge back then?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Ning Xiaoren had followed his father's plan, offering improved captives, and gained his freedom from the dungeon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">On the surface, he had been expelled from the Ning family, becoming a wandering cultivator.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Following the Ning family patriarch's guidance, Ning Xiaoren also entered the Lava Immortal Palace, trying hard to get close to Ning Zhuo and earn his forgiveness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">But he failed; Ning Zhuo didn't even spare him a glance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">This made Ning Xiaoren feel a deep humiliation, and his hatred for Ning Zhuo grew stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Family Territory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was so angry she wanted to tear the intelligence report to shreds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Her face twisted as she screamed, "Xiaohui, where is my Xiaohui? What is Ning Zhuo? How is he worthy of being on the ranking list? If he's there, Xiaohui must be ahead of him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Ning Xiaohui's grandmother pressed the report to her face, her eyes just a fingernail's distance from the paper.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">She searched hard, reading word by word, but found nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">In her fury, she tore the report to pieces, hissing like a venomous snake: "Fake, fake, this report is fake! Hahaha!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Lava Immortal Palace, Main Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The dragon turtle fire spirit was even weaker.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Due to secretly interfering with the normal functioning of the Lava Immortal Palace, using the beast tide to destroy a core mechanical construct within the palace, it suffered another fire blade decapitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">After being severely injured a second time, the dragon turtle fire spirit's current state was less than fifty percent of its peak.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Among the entire palace examination ranking list, it only paid attention to three people.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">One was Zhu Xuanji, after all, he was first, from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, and knew many secrets of the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Another was Meng Chong. The dragon turtle fire spirit always hoped he would inherit the Lava Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The last one was Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"How did Ning Zhuo sense the upcoming palace examination?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The dragon turtle fire spirit had too many matters to attend to, especially now, as the beast tide required more of its attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">So, recently, it had neglected Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">However, it had personally witnessed Ning Zhuo boldly offering the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Such decisiveness and determination made the dragon turtle fire spirit feel a chill throughout its body.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Facing this little monster, it grew increasingly fearful.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"He must not be allowed to obtain the position of palace master."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">"Otherwise, if I can't escape, how will I live in the future?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">People began to speculate on who the ultimate victor of the palace examination would be. Who would laugh last and finally seize the Lava Immortal Palace?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Most agreed that Zhu Xuanji was the first choice. He was ranked first, represented the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, and was renowned nationwide with exceptional strength.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">The public generally believed that the city lord's side was too weak. Just from the ranking list, only Meng Chong and some other Qi Refining juniors were present. But the true insiders knew that the Meng family's main force was in the second tier, eyeing the top three with ambition and ready to strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The heated discussions had just begun when the first elimination occurred.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">To be precise, on the afternoon the list was announced, a corpse was discovered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">It was an assassination.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">The heart of the corpse was destroyed, and the soul had vanished without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">This immediately reminded people of Zheng Jian, who had died in the same manner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Thus, the blame was placed on Yang Chanyu!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">"Someone is impersonating me, starting to eliminate competitors. Hmph!" Being framed made Yang Chanyu feel quite displeased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">But she didn't act, instead hiding deeper with Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">They were in a dangerous situation now; once they showed themselves, they would surely be besieged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Previously, Yang Chanyu was the focal point of concentrated attacks. But with the "entry criteria" revealed, Sun Lingtong attracted even more hatred than Yang Chanyu.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Now, the public believed that the top name in the palace examination would become the master of the Immortal Palace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Many cultivators were envious. Even those not on the list harbored the hope that by eliminating those on the list, they might obtain it themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Such an opportunity might come only once in a lifetime. So many were willing to take the risk and gamble!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Ning Zhuo had long gambled, staking his future on the righteous path, his name, his life, and even the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"With the palace examination out, it's hard for me to find an opportunity to establish my foundation in a short time." Ning Zhuo sighed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">As soon as he knew the list, he ran to Ning Jiufan's side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"Ancestor, it's terrifying. I'm also on the list, and I'm so scared, scared of being eliminated." Ning Zhuo made no effort to hide his desire for protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Jiufan scolded him for lacking backbone but still took him along.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Not only Ning Zhuo, but Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and several others who were also on the list were brought by Ning Jiufan for protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Soon after, Zhu Xuanji gathered everyone in one place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo noticed that not only Ning Jiufan, but the golden core ancestors of the Zhou and Zheng families also took their Qi Refining juniors with them for real-time protection.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">After all, they only had Qi Refining cultivation, too weak to protect themselves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Previously, it was Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu from the Void Sect who might have acted maliciously. Now that the palace examination list was out, even righteous path cultivators could become murderers!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Zhu Xuanji considered this and once again gathered everyone, unifying the front, agreeing to cooperate as much as possible rather than engaging in internal strife early on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">His proposal was immediately recognized and supported by the golden core cultivators of the three families.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Zhu Xuanji also instructed them: If possible, try to collect fragments and pieces of the golden furnace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">He never let go of this crucial clue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Previously, the golden furnace was nearly inaccessible, a heavily guarded area of the Immortal Palace. Even trial disciples found it so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">But now, with the scarlet flame beast tide covering the outer circle of the Immortal Palace, the assault on the inner area was constant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">If the beast tide reached the golden furnace area, the defenses of the Lava Immortal Palace would inevitably relax, allowing cultivators to approach.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"These broken bricks of the golden furnace have tracing back to the roots value." This was Zhu Xuanji's original statement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Zhuo was present, listening, and patiently admired how difficult this divine constable was. Even at the palace examination stage, he was still thinking about clues.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"He might be hoping to use these clues to find Yang Chanyu and Boss Sun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"If that happens in the future, I'll have to use the Five Elements Cannon Tower to cleanse the area." Ning Zhuo reminded himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">The palace examination came faster than anyone expected.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">A teleportation circle and a piece of information appeared simultaneouslyâ€”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The first round of elimination begins.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Candidates, please step into the light diagram, latecomers will be considered forfeiting.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Everyone stepped into the light diagram without hesitation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The next moment, they found themselves in a vast plaza.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">In the plaza, tables and meditation mats were arranged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">On each table were stacks of jade slips.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Each cultivator was assigned to a table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">They looked at each other, then at the table in front of them. Some impatient ones immediately sat cross-legged on the mats.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">New information was conveyed, and everyone knew: This was the first round of the examination, using a question-and-answer format to obtain scores.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Based on the specific scores, the ranking list would be adjusted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The last ten on the list would be eliminated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Anyone who attacked others, plotted, or attempted to cheat would be eliminated!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">In an instant, everyone became tense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Ning Zhuo was especially so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">After all, he was currently ranked last.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"Hey, can you do it?" Yang Chanyu shouted at Sun Lingtong, "You're the last one." Her shout immediately drew everyone's attention.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Indeed!" In an instant, everyone confirmed their suspicions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Meng Chong glared at Sun Lingtong, this childlike demonic cultivator was playing with him!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Sun Lingtong was filled with concern for Ning Zhuo, never looking in his direction, but laughing carelessly, expressing abundant confidence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The palace examination officially began.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Ning Zhuo's heart rate slightly accelerated as he quickly picked up a jade slip and placed it on his forehead to examine it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">There were many questions, and he needed to imprint his answers on the jade slip with his divine sense.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Ning Zhuo's eyebrows twitched, his mood soaring.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Question one: "Mirror unites yin and yang, observing inside and out." How does the "Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique" use the mirror to perceive, uniting yin and yang, to discern the truth of things? Please explain the path of spirit communication through the mirror, combining yin-yang transformations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Question two: "When the muscles are dyed, the bones are also firm." How does the "Demonic Blood Vein Technique" use the method of dyeing muscles and bones with blood to make them stand together, doubling strength? Please discuss its effect on cultivators, combining the relationship between muscles and bones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Question three: The Five Elements Transformation Disk contains one path of five elements mana each. What are the ways for a cultivator to, after neutralizing three paths of fire element spells, leave two paths of water and wood element mana each?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Everyone: "The Demonic Blood Vein Technique is indeed one of the three sects' top methods, but the content of the fifth level of Qi Refining doesn't involve the level of dyeing muscles and bones with blood at all!" "And what is the Five Elements Transformation Disk?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"The 'Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique' is also one of the three sects' top methods! But I've never seen it!" "I'm doomed, doomed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"Don't panic, stay calm. If I don't know, others won't either!" "Yes, yes, if everyone doesn't know, the final ranking won't change much. It won't!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
