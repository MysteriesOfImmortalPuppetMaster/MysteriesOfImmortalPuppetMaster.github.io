<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 157: Ning Xiaoren vs Ning Zhuo</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">"This trend must not be allowed to continue!" "Ning Zhuo must be severely punished!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Ning Xiaoren made up his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">This time, Ning Zhuo had crossed his bottom line.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Ning Xiaoren knew that if he were to be lenient or indulgent, it would bring significant hidden dangers and risks to the main branch's rule.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">He had to act swiftly and precisely to eliminate the threat!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">However, Ning Xiaoren was not a demon cultivator; the righteous path emphasized having a justified reason for one's actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">The righteous path's style was to leave a line of retreat for future encounters, while the demonic path often eradicated threats completely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Even though Ning Xiaoren was the young clan leader, dealing with Ning Zhuo from the branch family required careful consideration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">He first gathered the reactions of the clan members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Regarding Ning Zhuo's voluntary withdrawal from the reformation team, there were generally two opinions within the clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">One was that Ning Zhuo, in his youthful arrogance, had become conceited with a bit of success, not knowing his own limits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">His actions were very wrong, angering the higher-ups of the family and ruining his own future.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">What if he didn't contribute? The main branch had Ning Xiaohui, and they didn't lack his bit of combat power.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The other opinion was understanding and admiring Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Many branch family members felt ashamed of their lack of courage to resist, worried about Ning Zhuo's future, and amazed by his actions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"This situation is not good!" Ning Xiaoren frowned, thought for a moment, and issued an order for his confidants to spread a viewpointâ€”that Ning Zhuo's actions were selfish, disregarding the collective, and openly defying the family, making the Zhou and Zheng families think poorly of them and making the City Lord's Mansion laugh at them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">However, a day later, when Ning Xiaoren collected public opinion again, he found that the clan members were discussing more about the severity of the main branch's unfair rewards and punishments.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Xiaoren did not get the result he wanted; instead, the clan's public opinion surged against him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">His attempt to divert the majority of the clan's attention and win their hearts had failed!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">This made it even more impossible to deal with Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">"Be patient and wait."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">"Within this day, Zheng Jian and Zhou Zesheng personally visited and discussed with Ning Zhuo, clearly aware of Ning Zhuo's withdrawal from the Ning family reformation team." "The intentions of these two families are too obvious. Heh heh heh." Ning Xiaoren decided to remain inactive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">Because he saw a glimmer of hope in the intelligence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Zheng Jian was the first to approach Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He was a typical Zheng family member, decisive and straightforward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">After visiting Ning Zhuo, he directly invited Ning Zhuo to join the Zheng family's reformation team.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">He had previously collaborated with Ning Zhuo to create the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng and had high hopes for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Zhou Zesheng was the second.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He spoke tactfully, even though he expressed an invitation, it was very subtle.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">From Ning Zhuo's perspective, he suggested that Ning Zhuo could secretly cooperate with the Zhou family, avoiding facing the Ning family relatives.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Chen Cha was the third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He personally delivered a sum of spirit stones, which were the profits from the Mechanical Fire Monkey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Of course, this was just an excuse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Chen Cha brought an invitation from the City Lord's Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">In dealing with the crisis of Yuan Dasheng, Ning Zhuo had to involve himself, and his various performances earned the recognition and appreciation of Fei Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The source of this invitation was Fei Si, a Golden Core Stage cultivator!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">However, after extending the invitation, Chen Cha also shared his thoughts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">With a complex expression, he advised Ning Zhuo, "Little Zhuo, you have caught the eye of Lord Fei Si, but this may not be a blessing." "Currently, your three families are united against the City Lord's Mansion. If you switch to the City Lord's side, the risk is enormous." "If you take this step, you might not have a way back."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"In fact, even if you cooperate with the Zhou and Zheng families, it is also very dangerous. People's hearts are unpredictable and changeable. The Ning family members who support you now may change their attitude and oppose you. You must be extremely cautious!" Ning Zhuo replied, "I understand, Elder Chen. Thank you for your concern."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The young man cupped his hands and bowed deeply to Chen Cha.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">He summoned Ning Chen and Ning Yong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Ning Yong said boldly, "Brother Zhuo, I support you!" "It's infuriating how the main branch is so unfair in their rewards and punishments." "If this place doesn't keep me, there will be another place that does. We won't suffer this injustice." "No matter which family you cooperate with, I'll follow you!" Ning Yong patted his chest, more indignant than Ning Zhuo himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Chen, on the other hand, frowned slightly and sighed deeply, "I think we should discuss this matter with the family elders." "After all, the Lava Immortal Palace is only temporary. The king has issued a recruitment order, and I believe that in two or three years at most, the palace will have a new master." "We are still young, and our lives are long. Brother Zhuo, you must consider your future." Ning Yong glared, "Are you suggesting that Brother Zhuo should shamelessly stay in the reformation team?" "Look at Ning Xiaohui, her progress is not even half of ours, yet she enjoys the benefits of the Enlightenment Diagram ahead of time." "What about us?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Ning Zhuo extended his arms, placing his hands on the shoulders of Ning Chen and Ning Yong, and smiled, "Don't worry too much." "I know you mean well."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"To be honest, this time, I may seem impulsive, but I have thought it through carefully." Ning Yong turned to Ning Zhuo, "Then, Brother Zhuo, tell us what to do next, and I'll follow you!" Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, "I called you here because I need your help with something." "Please, just say it." Ning Chen immediately expressed his willingness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Ning Zhuo said, "Today, I practiced the Immortal Palace's techniques and gained some insights. Please inform our fellow reformation team members." "If they are interested, we can discuss the techniques here today."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">"Ah, it's about this?" Ning Yong was very surprised.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Chen frowned and asked the key question, "Among the reformation team members, there are also those from the main branch..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Ning Zhuo waved his hand, "Naturally, we will only invite those from the branch family." "Alright." A gleam of understanding flashed in Ning Chen's eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">"Good!" Ning Yong raised his arm in excitement, feeling a sense of relief, "We won't include the main branch; we'll do our own thing." They quickly gathered almost all the branch family members.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">These people were very interested.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Previously, Ning Zhuo had actively supported them, using the Life Hanging by a Thread, Sharp Advance Needle, and Ice Light Strong Vein Talisman to help them quickly enhance their magical power and cultivation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Later, Ning Zhuo led them to break through barriers, setting new records for the Ning family and achieving excellent results.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">As the clan leader and young clan leader had seen, Ning Zhuo's influence over them was astonishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">"What? Ning Zhuo did not accept the invitations from the Zhou and Zheng families, and instead spent the past few days widely inviting fellow students to share his insights on techniques?" Ning Xiaoren frowned upon hearing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He looked at the clan's public opinion again and found that more clan members were praising Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">After each session of sharing, the returning cultivators spoke highly of Ning Zhuo's techniques and felt greatly benefited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Many began to discuss Ning Zhuo's talent, as his recent insights into techniques had been impressive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">As a result, many branch family members felt a strong sense of empathy for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The more talented Ning Zhuo appeared, the more the main branch's harshness and unfair treatment stood out.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Ning Xiaoren couldn't sit still.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">He stood up, hands behind his back, pacing back and forth in his study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He hadn't expected Ning Zhuo not to make a mistake!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">If it were him at that age, he would have already joined the Zhou or Zheng families, striving to perform better and achieve more outstanding results to prove himself and show that the Ning family elders were blind and unfair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">If Ning Zhuo had done that, Ning Xiaoren could have taken the opportunity to act, reversing public opinion and branding Ning Zhuo as a traitor to the Ning family, causing him to be ostracized.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Reaching that point, Ning Xiaoren would have had a legitimate reason to impose more sanctions on Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"Ning Zhuo didn't make a mistake!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"At his age, did he understand the subtleties, or was it just a lucky guess?" Ning Xiaoren, as the young clan leader of the Ning family, had held his position for a long time, unchallenged.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">This alone was enough to demonstrate his capability.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">After pondering for a moment, he came up with a plan, "I need to provoke Ning Zhuo into making a big mistake!" "Ning Ze can be used."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Ning Zhuo is greedy for money and has a poor relationship with Ning Ze. The key is that Wang Lan has not compensated Ning Zhuo with any resources yet." "What will Ning Zhuo think?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">"Heh heh heh."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Xiaoren figured out the key points and immediately left his study to meet Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">He didn't hide anything and directly told Ning Ze the truth, "If you can persuade Ning Zhuo to return to the reformation team and bow to the family elders, I will set you free!" Ning Ze, hearing this, grabbed onto this last straw of hope like a drowning man.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Xiaoren then arranged for Wang Lan to visit Ning Ze in prison.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Husband, what's happened to you?" Wang Lan exclaimed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">The couple faced each other through the thick bars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">Ning Ze was covered in wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">The prison had powerful healing methods, but Ning Xiaoren had deliberately held back, only partially treating Ning Ze to highlight his crisis.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">As a result, when Wang Lan visited, she saw many wounds on Ning Ze still seeping blood.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Ignoring the pain, Ning Ze spoke urgently, "Ning Zhuo has wronged me, wronged me." "I learned everything from the young clan leader."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">"That little brat Ning Zhuo had the audacity to withdraw from the reformation team! What does he think of my efforts?" "Back then, I spent money to secure his place in the reformation team."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">"Now the young clan leader wants us to persuade Ning Zhuo to return to the team. You must get this done!" "If you succeed, the young clan leader will set me free." Wang Lan's eyes widened, "Really?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">"Sigh!" Ning Ze sighed, "At this point, I can only trust the young clan leader's promise." "Look at my injuries!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"My cultivation is sealed here. I'm not a body cultivator; I can't last long." Wang Lan nodded repeatedly, "Husband, I will do my best to persuade Ning Zhuo to change his mind." "You must succeed!" Ning Ze said, "Even if it takes money, it's worth it!" Wang Lan's eyes flickered, "Yes, alright."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Ning Ze knew his wife too well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Seeing her hesitation, he became more serious, "You foolish woman, you don't understand the gravity of the situation!" "You must not let that brat Ning Zhuo do anything reckless!"</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
