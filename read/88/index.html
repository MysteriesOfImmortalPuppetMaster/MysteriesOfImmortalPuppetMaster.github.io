<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Ning Xiaoren returned to his reception hall and quickly summoned Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"Come, sit, have some tea." Ning Xiaoren smiled as he gestured for Ning Ze to sit to his side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Ze was filled with suspicion and uncertainty. This was the first time Ning Xiaoren had treated him like this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">He quickly said, "If there's anything that needs doing, please give me your instructions, junior patriarch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Ning Xiaoren pointed to the seat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Ning Ze sat down uneasily.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Ning Xiaoren took a light sip of tea and sighed emotionally. "Ning Ze, you‚Äôve raised a good nephew."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Ning Ze stood up at once. "Sir, did Little Zhuo do something wrong? I‚Äôll go home right away and discipline him properly!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Ning Xiaoren‚Äôs eyes widened slightly. He waved his hand three times. "Sit, sit. No need to be nervous. It‚Äôs good news, a joyous matter."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">As he spoke, the half-seated Ning Ze gradually widened his eyes, and then even opened his mouth in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Even when he left Ning Xiaoren‚Äôs reception hall and returned home, the look of shock still lingered on his face.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Peak of the third level of Qi Refining!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Standing out during the joint examination of the three clans!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">On par with prodigies like Ning Xiaohui and Zheng Jian!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Was this really Ning Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Was this still the Ning Zhuo he remembered?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"How did Little Zhuo pull it off? Is the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation really that suited for him?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Full of doubt and curiosity, Ning Ze called out to his wife Wang Lan. "Prepare for a family dinner tonight. Pick a restaurant and order some spirit food."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Wang Lan was puzzled. "Ordering spirit food costs a lot. Husband, what‚Äôs the occasion? What are we celebrating?‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">"Like I said, it‚Äôs a family dinner. Invite Little Zhuo over. Sigh, as his uncle, I haven‚Äôt seen him in so long," Ning Ze said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Wang Lan's eyes widened and she shrieked, "What? Invite Little Zhuo for a meal? And order spirit food? Husband, have you gone mad?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">Ning Ze said sternly, "You‚Äôre just a woman, what do you know? This is a task given by the junior patriarch himself..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He then briefly recounted what Ning Xiaoren had told him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Wang Lan stood frozen for a long time after hearing it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">"Little Zhuo?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"You‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs Little Zhuo?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">Ning Ze snorted coldly. "Would I lie to you? Would the junior patriarch lie to me? This all happened during the joint examination of the three clans. So many people witnessed it with their own eyes, how could it be fake?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Wang Lan opened and closed her mouth several times, wanting to speak, but in the end said nothing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Her eyes were wide, and her expression was extremely complicated. There was disbelief, denial, unwillingness, jealousy, and disappointment...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Ning Ze‚Äôs face sank. "What are you thinking about? Hurry up and prepare."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Wang Lan responded, "Alright, alright, husband, I‚Äôll get it done."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">She turned to leave. Her gaze was still vacant, her walking was stiff, and her demeanor as a whole was lost and dispirited.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Once no one was around, Ning Ze also let out a long sigh.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Ning Xiaoren had ordered him to win over Ning Zhuo and try and extract some information from him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">In the sixteen years of Ning Zhuo‚Äôs life, this was the first time Ning Ze had lowered himself to invite his nephew for a meal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Ning Ze was someone who valued his pride above all. This kind of order made him feel awful. Where was his dignity as a senior?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">But he had no choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The junior patriarch had given the order himself, and he could only obey.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Of course, his rational side also told him that Ning Zhuo was no longer who he used to be. Building a good relationship with him would be beneficial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">‚Ä¶</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">After leaving the Zhou Clan, many people walked with Ning Zhuo for a long while, even though it wasn‚Äôt on their way at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">At the final junction, Ning Zhuo proactively bade farewell to them, keeping only Ning Chen and Ning Yong by his side.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Once he got home, he even invited Ning Chen and Ning Yong into his house for tea and a short chat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">Though it was only a brief conversation, both Ning Chen and Ning Yong left feeling greatly honored. As they went on their way, their faces were flush with excitement and they continuously praised Ning Zhuo, saying how he hadn‚Äôt grown arrogant after becoming famous and still treated people sincerely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo waited patiently. It wasn‚Äôt long before the invitation from Ning Ze arrived.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">"It‚Äôs not a personal summons from the Ning Clan patriarch, or even from the junior patriarch Ning Xiaoren?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo sneered inwardly, but on the surface, he sincerely thanked the messenger. He smiled warmly and said that he would definitely attend on time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The family dinner was lavish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">In sixteen years, Ning Zhuo had never eaten such good food at Ning Ze‚Äôs place.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Even with so much spirit food in front of her, Wang Lan hardly ate a bite. Moreover, she barely spoke during the dinner, completely unlike her usual garrulous self. When she glanced surreptitiously at Ning Zhuo, it was as if his whole body was radiating blinding light; just a look made her feel like her heart was being pierced.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Ning Ji also found the food tasteless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">For him, all of this had happened far too suddenly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Ning Ze‚Äôs expression remained calm. The authority of a senior that he had carried for sixteen years wasn‚Äôt something he could put down just like that.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo didn‚Äôt eat much either. Every time Ning Ze asked a question, he would put down his cup or chopsticks and reply respectfully. His answers were brief and concise, clearly unwilling to say more, and he maintained a distant attitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Ning Ze knew very well that he needed to smile, to bow his head, to be more conciliatory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">But even after the dinner ended and Ning Zhuo left, he hadn‚Äôt managed to do so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Ji quietly followed behind Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">He didn‚Äôt even know why he was doing this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Maybe it was the doubts in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">"How could he cultivate to the peak of the third level? It doesn‚Äôt make sense!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">"Is it really just that the technique suits him that well?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"No, I have to investigate. He must have some sort of secret!!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">"You followed me?" Ning Zhuo had already noticed Ning Ji behind him and deliberately slowed down to make it easier for him to keep up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Under Ning Ji‚Äôs watchful eyes, Ning Zhuo visited many pill stores, purchasing large quantities of cultivation pills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Ning Ji was shocked. "How is he so rich?! Richer than my father?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">"Even though he‚Äôs revealed his cultivation base, the clan resources haven‚Äôt been distributed yet. Even if they had, it wouldn‚Äôt be this many spirit stones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">"This money isn‚Äôt clean, it must be illicit!!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">"I have to report this!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Overjoyed, Ning Ji hurried home to report everything to Ning Ze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Xiaoren learned of the situation even earlier than Ning Ze. After instructing Ning Ze to win Ning Zhuo over, he had immediately sent a team of cultivators to secretly protect Ning Zhuo's safety. Of course, they were also there to monitor him and report back with any changes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">"Ning Zhuo actually possesses such a huge sum of money?" Ning Xiaoren stared at the paper in his hand in disbelief.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">This paper listed all the kinds of medicinal pills that Ning Zhuo had recently bulk purchased.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Xiaoren's eyes were practically spitting fire as he read. "If I knew Ning Zhuo was this wealthy, I would've gotten close to him sooner.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">"Did his parents secretly leave it for him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Or is this dirty money from an illicit source? Perhaps he‚Äôs being secretly supported by a demonic cultivator?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">Ning Xiaoren paced back and forth in his study.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">As his thoughts churned, the fire of greed in his heart burned brighter and hotter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Ning Zhuo is from the branch family, yet he already has the same cultivation base as Ning Xiaohui. Now he also has a vast fortune at his disposal...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"This large sum of money has an unclear origin. For the sake of the clan, I must investigate it thoroughly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">"Besides, I won‚Äôt need to act personally. I can just let Ning Ze do it. That would be quite fitting, wouldn't it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Finally, he stopped walking and called out to the door, "Someone, come!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">A servant immediately pushed the door open and entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">One hour later, Ning Ze and Ning Fan[^1] led a group of cultivators to surround Ning Zhuo‚Äôs small courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Ning Ze frowned tightly. "Do we really have to do this? This isn‚Äôt appropriate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Ning Fan said, "Didn‚Äôt Sir Junior Patriarch give you clear instructions? The recultivation team concerns a matter as significant as Lava Immortal Palace, and we can‚Äôt afford any oversight.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">‚ÄúNing Zhuo‚Äôs large fortune has an unknown origin. As his biological uncle, it is your duty to take action.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">"The clan may need rely on Ning Zhuo in the future. You are his blood relative, so you‚Äôre the most suitable person to do this.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"Now go."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">Ning Ze was from the branch family, while Ning Fan was from the main family. The latter had been sent specially by Ning Xiaoren to supervise the whole matter.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">With no choice, Ning Ze sighed and knocked on the courtyard gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Ning Zhuo opened the gate, greeted them respectfully, and asked why they had come.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">"Let‚Äôs speak inside," Ning Ze said with a solemn expression. Without waiting for an invitation, he stepped inside the courtyard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">The people behind him filed in one by one, pushing Ning Zhuo to the side near the gate.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">At the same time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">The three clan leaders met again in secret to continue negotiations.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">This time, they were going to finalize the distribution of benefits among the three clans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">"Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellets are extremely effective for restoring soul power. They should be distributed equally among the three clans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">"No way," the Ning Clan patriarch objected. "Our clan has Ning Xiaohui and Ning Zhuo, two prodigies. We have to make sure they have enough resources, right? The Zheng Clan only has one prodigy to think about.‚Äù</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">The Zheng Clan patriarch immediately snorted coldly. "That Ning Zhuo just matches well with the technique. He has no real innate talent. What kind of prodigy is that? He doesn't count!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Just then, a knock suddenly came at the door.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">The pupils of the three clan leaders contracted sharply, and their hearts jolted.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Who is it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"It‚Äôs me, Zhu Xuanji!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"Ah, so it‚Äôs Sir Divine Investigator." The three clan leaders quickly opened the door and welcomed Zhu Xuanji in.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">They had arranged for subordinates to guard outside, but to a Golden Core cultivator, this kind of defense was completely meaningless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Zhu Xuanji wore a pleasant smile. "Patriarchs, I‚Äôve come this time to request something."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Zhu Xuanji had already acquired detailed records from the City Lord and read up on the all cultivators who had entered the Lava Immortal Palace over the years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">But those were just the records from the City Lord Mansion.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Zhu Xuanji now hoped to gather similar records from each of the three great clans in order to piece together a more complete version.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">All three clan leaders were still at the Foundation Establishment stage. Given that they were united in opposing the City Lord Mansion, in some respects, their interests aligned with those of the royal family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">The three patriarchs immediately ordered their people to fetch the relevant records and handed them over to Zhu Xuanji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Most of the content came from the Zheng and Zhou Clans. The Ning Clan had only discovered the Lava Immortal Palace this year, so their records were rather sparse.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Zhu Xuanji glanced through them and nodded repeatedly, clearly satisfied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">As a member of the royal family, he had no desire to see Meng Kui and Meng Chong seize Lava Immortal Palace and allow the Meng Clan‚Äôs influence to expand again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Thus, before leaving, he offered a suggestion. "I heard a familiar name when I arrived. If you're referring to Ning Zhuo, then that kid is worth nurturing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"His character still needs observation, but he has some talent in mechanical arts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"The explosive fire monkey was designed and created by him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">The three clan leaders widened their eyes in unison, shock spreading across their faces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">The Ning Clan patriarch opened his mouth. "What?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">Zhu Xuanji smiled faintly. "Publicly, the credit is given to the Flying Disk Workshop‚Äôs Chen Cha, but there‚Äôs more behind the scenes. Actually, it involves Fei Si. If you investigate, you‚Äôll understand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">These few words were enough explanation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Zhu Xuanji waved his hand and disappeared on the spot, leaving the three patriarchs staring at one another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Gradually, the Ning Clan patriarch slightly raised his head and exhaled heavily. His face was full of joy. "Did you both hear that clearly? Sir Zhu Xuanji said it himself!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Zhou and Zheng Clan patriarchs momentarily fell silent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">Basking in delight, the Ning Clan patriarch had no idea that Ning Zhuo was currently being subjected to intense interrogation in his very own clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
