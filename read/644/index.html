<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">Forgetful River Era 973</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Luo Si was framed by his own kin and met a gruesome death, his body completely destroyed. Denied entry to the ancestral hall, his resentment transformed him into a vengeful ghost, banished to the underworld.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Forgetful River Era 974</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Corrupted by resentment, his soul drifted listlessly along the banks of the Forgetful River, teetering on the brink of dissolution. Guided by the Ash Bone Elder, he was taught the Oblivion's Guidance technique, using the waters of the Forgetful River to purify his obsessions. He vowed to repay this kindness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Forgetful River Era 980</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Enlisted as a squad leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Leading five ragged soldiers, he set a whirlpool trap at Stranded Beach, ambushing the leader of a band of raiders. His early display of talent in river warfare earned him promotion to platoon leader.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Forgetful River Era 982</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">During the Yellow Turban River escort battle, he lured enemies into an ambush with a decrepit boat, using hidden currents to turn the tide against the Nine Hells pirates and capture their vessel. Honored with the title "Forgetful River Water Warrior," he was promoted to centurion in the Blackwater Army. After the battle, he personally authored the Ten Rules of Boat Handling to train new recruits, with notable success.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Forgetful River Era 986</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Deploying a hundred light skiffs in a deceptive formation, he lured the Drowned Army into a shallow bay. Over three days, he secretly amassed water pressure before unleashing a devastating whirlpool that annihilated three thousand enemies. He was promoted to deputy general.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Forgetful River Era 990</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Defended Dragon-Severing Gorge against the White Bone Fleet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After being besieged by the White Bone Fleet for over three months and nearing exhaustion of supplies, Luo Si calmed the troops through fishing. During this time, he gained insight into the military strategy "Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">He then abandoned the large ships, leading thousands of small boats in a night raid that, like an ant swarm, overwhelmed and destroyed several enemy vessels.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">The White Bone Fleet withdrew, and Luo Si successfully defended himself, though severely wounded. He was bestowed the title of "Abyssal Contemplation Ghost General."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Forgetful River Era 993</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">He was transferred to North Deer Immortal City for recuperation, where he also served as City Guard Commander.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">He quelled the Smiling Face Gambling House uprising and purged Resentful Infant Alley.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Forgetful River Era 995</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">When foreign enemies invaded and the City Lord of Solid Ice Immortal City fell, Luo Si was specially appointed as City Guard Commander and temporary City Lord.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After seven days of surveying the treacherous shoals, he adjusted the river's flow, diverting the Ice Rush River tide and ensuring the grain supply route remained open.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">He detected Soul-Devouring Yin Earthworms, using soul waves to repel them and protect over ninety percent of the medicinal fields, thwarting the enemy's plot.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Forgetful River Era 996</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">He suppressed a violent uprising of malevolent spirits in the Ice Cavern without damaging the seals.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Forgetful River Era 997</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">After successful special training at Bone-Corroding Beach, he created a new military unit: the Frost Hell Contemplation Guard.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Forgetful River Era 998</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">He was promoted to Commander of the Northwest Frost Halberd Army.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Guarding the border, he slew thousands of enemies, keeping the Ghost Wolf Pack in check and maintaining peace along the frontier.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">Forgetful River Era 999</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He was appointed temporary commander to lead an expedition against White Paper Immortal City in the Living Realm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">After reviewing Luo Si's service record, Sun Lingtong sighed, "I never expected that Ghost General Luo Si, who's been dead in the Underworld for only twenty or thirty years, would already have risen to the position of Prefectural Commander."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Beside him, Zeng Jide withdrew his divine sense. "He received guidance from the Ash Bone Elder. I suspect the elder's involvement. Luo Si's rise through the ranks has been too smooth and deliberate."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Sun Lingtong frowned. "Why would a Nascent Soul cultivator rush here to retrieve Luo Si's service record? Could it be..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Zeng Jide replied, "An official's service record in the Underworld Prefecture serves a similar purpose to a life token or soul lamp in a Super Sect - a powerful means of control."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"What else could it be?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"Nothing more than using this record to deal with Luo Si. It seems he's been disobedient and needs a proper lesson."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Sun Lingtong nodded, his suspicions confirmed. A wave of worry washed over him. "The Forgetful River Prefecture's attitude toward Luo Si has changed drastically. Could it be that he held back at the last moment, deliberately letting his opponents escape, and raised suspicions?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Altar Battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The torrent of military strategy ravaged the Imperial Guard's positions, crippling the entire defending force in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Both sides were too stunned to react, leaving only the screams of the gravely wounded and the deafening roar of the strategic bombardment.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Countless gazes, sharp as arrows, converged on Luo Si.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">If looks could kill, Luo Si would have been pierced by ten thousand arrows, dead beyond death.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Yet under the weight of all those eyes, Luo Si remained calm, as if the one who had turned the tide, the one who had overturned the entire war, wasn't him at all.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">His gaze was slightly unfocused as he stared at the Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation military strategy before him, recalling the moment of his epiphany...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Dragon-Severing Gorge lived up to its name.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">The jagged black rocks on either side, like the interlocked fangs of colossal beasts, clamped down on the most treacherous stretch of the river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">The muddy waves crashed against the gorge walls, shattering into a sky-darkening mist of foul-smelling Yin Qi, only to merge back into the relentless torrent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Luo Si, then still a subordinate general, had been ordered to defend this strategic chokepoint and halt the main advance of the White Bone Fleet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">After over three months of bitter fighting, more than half of Luo Si's warships had been destroyed, his supplies of arrows, talismans, and other resources were exhausted, and his formations grew increasingly difficult to repair.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Deep within the gorge, the hastily constructed Water Fortress swayed like a decaying log adrift in the raging currents, completely surrounded by the White Bone Fleet. The pervasive yin wind that swept across the river carried despairing whispers as it passed through the fortress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Luo Si had exhausted every means of securing reinforcements and was certain none would come. Trapped in this hopeless situation, with his great vengeance yet unfulfilled, he refused to surrender.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The soldiers' morale, stretched taut as a bowstring on the verge of snapping, hung by a thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Luo Si knew he had to steady the Military Heart. Otherwise, defeat and annihilation would follow in the next breath.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Though he could see no hope, he refused to give up until the very end.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Provisions and armaments were depleted. To maintain morale, he needed another way.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Fortunately, his passion for fishing provided a solution.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Each dusk, when the White Bone Fleet's assaults temporarily subsided, he would climb alone to a precarious ledge jutting from the gorge's edge. Below, the main channel of the Forgetful River collided with the turbulent waters of the Underworld Flood Dragon River, creating a maelstrom of swirling currents and roiling yin winds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Unarmored, clad only in a black robe, he held a fishing rod and let the line drift into the abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">With each cast of his rod and every gaze at the subtle ripples on the water's surface, Luo Si exuded a martyr-like focus and tranquility. A silence enveloped him, strangely settling over the entire Water Fortress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">The soldiers hid behind the battered hulls of their ships, watching their general with weary, almost numb eyes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">The suffocating despair and agitation, it seemed, were gradually suppressed and settled by a deeper, colder force within this silent ritual.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Luo Si sat motionless as iron, his composure unshaken on the surface, but inwardly he burned with anxiety, desperately racking his brain for a way to break through this desperate situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Only three capital ships remained, none capable of standing against any of the White Bone Fleet's vessels. The numerous small boats, each barely able to carry five men, seemed utterly useless.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">As his thoughts grew stale, his gaze pierced the river surface, catching sight of a faint blue light drifting silently beneath the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">It was a school of small fish, gliding in like fine dust.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Then more tiny blue specks lit up one by one, gathering like motes of dust, their shadows gradually coalescing into distinct outlines - a boundless school of fish, layer upon layer!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">They stirred silently beneath the water, their bodies trembling imperceptibly, emitting a mysterious blue light.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Suddenly, billions of these faint glimmers converged, coalescing into a surging, silver-blue river that swept through the water with a silent roar.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The luminous stream illuminated the long-submerged wreckage of weapons, armor, and ships, illuminating the silent underwater battlefield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">A single fish was as insignificant as a speck of dust, but now, as the school converged and swirled, they altered the current beneath the river, creating a massive, whirlpool-like undercurrent - a fleeting, colossal presence like a submarine tornado.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Luo Si's heart pounded with awe, as if struck by a hammer.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">A flash of enlightenment pierced the divine sea, shattering the murky depths of his heart and illuminating the murky waters within.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"Our military strength is waning, and we're trapped in a desperate situation. This accumulated water in the Abyss, like a beast's maw, threatens to devour all living things."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Yet, the deeper we sink into the Abyss, the more we must conceal our scales beneath the water."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"We are as weak as these tiny fish, gathering silently at the Abyss's depths... waiting for that fleeting moment when light flashes, when specks unite, when we can be coordinated and, if necessary, sacrifice ourselves without fear. Then, we too can become a torrential flood."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"The deeper the Abyss gathers, the more unstoppable its wave-shattering power becomes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Once unleashed, it will transform into the most formidable Abyssal Current, devouring everything in its path!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Amidst the countless wreckage and broken weapons on the riverbed, in its deepest, silent recesses, it seemed as if their past cries were erupting anew, now echoing rumblingly within Luo Si's divine sea.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Luo Si lowered his rod.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">A single droplet fell from the empty hook tip, returning to the Abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">His resolve was firm.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Turning, he faced the countless eyes in the Water Fortress - some bewildered, some weary, some hiding a glimmer of hope.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Back in the camp, he issued his command, his voice calm to the point of indifference: "Scuttle the ships."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">The crowd was stunned.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Scuttle the ships? In this watery no-man's-land, abandoning the ships was no different from cutting their own throats!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Luo Si's gaze swept across the three battered flagship warships, their Formation Spirit Stones nearly depleted, without a hint of reluctance. "The large ships are useless - they'll only serve as targets. Destroy them, salvage the refined iron Dragon Bones, and forge spears and arrows. Prepare the remaining small boats and rafts with oil and Yin Fire Talismans."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">The orders were concise, each word carrying the weight of a thousand catties.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">That night, aided by the thick river mist and the White Bone Fleet's complacency born of their perceived superiority, countless small boats surged forth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Under the influence of the military strategy Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation, each small boat moved like a fish in a school, working in perfect coordination. Drifting with the current, they attacked en masse, disregarding casualties as they pressed forward in waves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">This was the overwhelming force of ants!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Each boat's attack was as weak as an ant's bite. But when dozens, then hundreds of these weak attacks erupted simultaneously, they churned the water like a school of fish, creating a dark, turbulent abyss.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Deadly chaos spread through the massive white bone giant ships! The grating groan of snapping Dragon Bones, the crackling explosion of Yin Fire lapping at the hulls, and the panicked screams of the crew...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">One, two... several of these colossal vessels tilted and disintegrated in the darkness!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">Luo Si led the charge, his soldiers swarming up the towering ships like ants crawling a dam. The brutal sounds of combat tore through the thick mist, firelight illuminating the gorge walls like infernal flames.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The enemy commander was both enraged and terrified. He had never witnessed such a bizarre and cunning tactic, one that clung like a festering wound! Seeing his giant ships falling one after another, panic spreading through his ranks, he had no choice but to order a retreat. For the first time, the massive and fearsome White Bone Fleet turned in disarray before the Dragon-Severing Gorge.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Victory achieved - a desperate counterattack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Having secured victory, Luo Si, gravely wounded and near death, was carried back to the Water Fortress.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The Prefect personally issued a decree praising his valor. Recalling how Luo Si had gained enlightenment through fishing at Dragon-Severing Gorge, where he had defended like an abyssal abyss, the Prefect bestowed upon him a new title more fitting to his current temperament and military strategy: Abyssal Contemplation Ghost General!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">This title signified a heart as deep as the abyssal sea, unfathomable and impenetrable, and praised his restrained yet unyielding nature, his ability to accumulate strength before unleashing it in a single, decisive strike!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">The past's harrowing drama, once vivid and intense, had ultimately been condensed into a terse entry in his official record.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">Luo Si's scattered gaze sharpened as he focused on assessing the outcome of his attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">This strike had been meticulously prepared and plotted over a long period.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation had mobilized the vast majority of Luo Si's military might, unleashing terrifying power that instantly slaughtered countless Imperial Guard soldiers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Luo Si's control was even more precise and ruthless, with a particular focus on the Mother of a Hundred Ghosts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Panicked, she hastily activated her defenses, but after holding out for only three breaths, she was overwhelmed by the surging waves of Abyss-Gazing Scale Accumulation and perished!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">Over ten thousand Imperial Guard soldiers were devastated. The center of their formation had been completely cleared, leaving only remnants in the four corners, all fleeing in terror.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Chaos reigned. Everything had descended into chaos.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Immortal Hanyan trembled violently, roaring in fury, "Luo Si, you traitor!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">Luo Si's subordinates, both shocked and enraged, surrounded him, weapons and magic treasures at the ready. "Luo Si, what's going on? Are you being controlled?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">Luo Si's betrayal was devastating. His single strike shattered the battlefield, overturning the entire war situation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">Despite his earth-shattering actions, his expression remained calm, his deep eyes reflecting the Qing-Jiao Army's charging advance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">His gaze settled silently on Ning Zhuo as he replied coolly, "I had hoped for a good gathering and a good parting, but circumstances have forced my hand."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">"Everyone, my apologies."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"I am a good person."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"What the hell?!" His subordinates were dumbfounded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">Luo Si suddenly raised his voice, his proclamation echoing across the entire battlefield:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"The Heavenly Dao shines brightly, and the Ghost Laws blaze gloriously!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">"I wield the heavens' authority to punish the disobedient, brandishing heavenly punishment to slay the traitorous!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">"The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, originally entrusted with the Netherworld's sustenance and charged with balancing the Forgetful River, has instead greedily devoured the heavens, his demonic heart obscuring the sun, his sins piling high into the Netherworld - "</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"First: Defying the Order of Heaven and Earth! The Heavenly Ghost perished in the primordial age, its remains destined for eternal rest. Yet the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord molded its bones from tainted earth, forged its veins with turbid qi, and refined it on the Sacrificial Altar, brazenly stealing its innate talent!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Second: Usurping the Royal Mandate! Holding the exalted position of Prefecture Lord, yet still craving more power, you dared to covet the Heavenly Ghost's remains. A king committing the acts of a bandit - such corruption is abhorred by ghosts and deities alike!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">"Third: Slaughtering Cities for Sacrifice! You claimed to 'face calamity,' yet your true intent was blood sacrifice! The million souls of White Paper Immortal City became fuel for your furnace. Mortal blood dyes pure scrolls crimson - such demonic deeds cannot be tolerated even in the Nine Hells!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">"Fourth: Imprisoning the Way and Betraying Righteousness! The Valley Master of Water Burial guards Heavenly Secrets in stillness. His grace to me rivals rebirth, his virtue permeating the Netherworld. Yet the Prefecture Lord, wielding his power, forced him into concealment, imprisoning his benefactor in a frigid pool and shackling the Stellar Tracks within the valley! Today, I repay this debt. How can I allow wolves to cage the phoenix and qilin?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">"Now I raise my spear against you, not to betray my lord, but to follow the will of Heaven! You have made the Forgetful River your personal tool, treating countless ghosts as mere straw dogs."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">"Where the Dark Lord reigns unjust, a wise sovereign awaits. Drawing our swords to follow the dragon, we shall reestablish the cosmic order!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">"Heaven's Punishment is clear, illuminating my resolve! With a wise sovereign by my side, my blade grows ever sharper!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Luo Si understood perfectly well that to wage war, one must first claim the moral high ground.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">Both sides stood frozen...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">Immortal Hanyan trembled with cold, his voice shaking as he spat, "Traitor! Shameless wretch! Your silver tongue deserves ten thousand deaths!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Ning Zhuo, however, seemed lost in thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">Sun Lingtong had encountered Luo Si alone while exploring the Underworld, by the banks of the Forgetful River, and received his assistance. As a result, Ning Zhuo knew many of the details, including Luo Si's guidance from the Ash Bone Elder.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="267">Among those present, Ning Zhuo was the first to accept this reality.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="269">Qing Chi: "What's he saying?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="271">Ning Zhuo, using his divine sense to communicate telepathically: "Ignore him. Focus on the attack!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="273">Qing Chi: "Got it!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="275">Under the young girl's command, the Qing-Jiao Army seized this critical opportunity, charging forward like a sharp dagger piercing the heart of Luo Si's forces.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="277">Luo Si's army had been severely weakened by recent deployments, leaving them shaken and demoralized. Exhausted and suffering heavy casualties, they were barely capable of resistance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="279">____________</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="282">Author: </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="283">Whew... 2025 has been even more difficult and exhausting than 2024. Despite giving it my all, there have still been moments of hesitation, confusion, and utter exhaustion where I felt like stopping altogether. Now, standing at a crossroads, I’m about to make a decision that might be called brave — or reckless! I, too, am pondering deeply, preparing myself at the edge of the abyss, sharpening my scales before the leap!</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
