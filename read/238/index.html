<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 238: Flowing Clouds</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo himself possessed some sewing skills.<br/>
<br/>
He had reserved some raw materials of Floating Clouds, intending to practice when he had time in the future.<br/>
<br/>
As for these Floating Cloud threads, he would first check their quality, and after confirming their authenticity, he would directly refine them into the Floating Cloud Cloak, enhancing the foundation of this magical artifact.<br/>
<br/>
What Ning Zhuo did not know was that Zhu Xuanji was not far behind him.<br/>
<br/>
The mask that Ning Zhuo wore did not possess great power; it merely concealed him from ordinary cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Many elite cultivators in the Foundation Establishment stage could easily spot the flaws in Ning Zhuo's face with a slight application of their spells.<br/>
<br/>
However, this was precisely what Ning Zhuo intended.<br/>
<br/>
His goal was to create an image of someone who was not adept at disguise in front of Zhu Xuanji and other Golden Core cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Since the chaotic battle among the Golden Cores, every action Ning Zhuo took was a performance, assuming that the Golden Core cultivators were constantly observing him.<br/>
<br/>
However, Zhu Xuanji was not following him into the Cloud Merchant's residence.<br/>
<br/>
He merely cast a brief glance at Ning Zhuo before turning and slipping into an alleyway.<br/>
<br/>
In a dead-end, he walked straight ahead and then crashed into a wall.<br/>
<br/>
The wall was merely a facade.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Zhu Xuanji entered a small courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother, it's been many years; I hope you are well." A short young man had been waiting for a long time and greeted him with a cheerful smile.<br/>
<br/>
His name was Zhu Zhen, a member of the Southern Bean royal family.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike Zhu Xuanji, Zhu Zhen had been secretly cultivated by the royal family long ago and had spent many years wandering outside, gathering first-hand intelligence for the royal family.<br/>
<br/>
In recent years, Zhu Zhen had been in the Flying Cloud Kingdom, searching for its secrets.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji and Zhu Zhen had a very good relationship, having grown up together.<br/>
<br/>
Upon seeing Zhu Zhen, Zhu Xuanji's face also broke into a joyful smile.<br/>
<br/>
He walked up to Zhu Zhen, extended his hands, and playfully slapped Zhu Zhen's arm. "Little brother, it's great to see you again! How's the food in the Flying Cloud? I remember you can't stand anything without spice."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen nodded, "Actually, it's not bad. The cuisine in the Flying Cloud Kingdom tends to be spicy due to the constant rain and humid weather." He continued, "But their kind of spice is different from what we have in the Southern Bean Kingdom. Well, after eating it for a while, you get used to it."<br/>
<br/>
After saying this, Zhu Zhen led Zhu Xuanji into the house, warmly welcoming him. "This is a very special Cloud Tea, harvested from the tea trees of the Myriad Clouds Sea. You should give it a try."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji looked at the cup and saw that the Cloud Tea leaves were slender and silvery in color, with a layer of greenish glow on the buds, resembling fuzz.<br/>
<br/>
He gently sniffed it.<br/>
<br/>
The aroma was pure and unique, reminiscent of the wild mountain air in the morning mist.<br/>
<br/>
As Zhu Xuanji took his first sip, the tea was clear and bright, melting in his mouth and instantly giving him a refreshing sensation as if he were amidst the sea of clouds.<br/>
<br/>
As the tea gradually returned sweetness in his mouth, the flavor became rich and mellow, with a hint of sweetness, akin to the dew contained within the clouds, with distinct layers of taste, full and rounded.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Zhu Xuanji exhaled a breath of turbid air, feeling the lingering taste of the tea, sweet and fragrant, like the fresh air after the mist dissipated, leaving him feeling relaxed and refreshed.<br/>
<br/>
Although Zhu Xuanji had traveled far and wide, he was still of royal descent and had a refined palate for tea. "Indeed, this is excellent tea!" Zhu Xuanji praised.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen laughed heartily, "I'm glad you like it! When I leave here and return to the capital, I‚Äôll bring you two pounds." "Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too little."<br/>
<br/>
"This Cloud Tea is extremely rare; I only managed to get five pounds in total!" The two enjoyed their tea and exchanged pleasantries, feeling joyful together.<br/>
<br/>
Although they had not seen each other for many years, their bond, forged in childhood, had only deepened over time, like fine wine.<br/>
<br/>
After chatting for a while, they began discussing future arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji asked, "Since you‚Äôve returned from the Flying Cloud Kingdom, you shouldn‚Äôt be going back anytime soon."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen nodded, "I‚Äôve received a secret order to return to the Confined Capital. Just in time, this Cloud Merchant is coming to the Southern Bean to do business, so I disguised myself as a helper to blend in, essentially hitching a ride." "According to my previous task deadline, I still have half a year left."<br/>
<br/>
"But I think the reason for my summons back this time is that the domestic situation has become tense. I‚Äôve heard some rumors that the Su family is making unusual moves, and the political situation at home is not very stable." Zhu Xuanji immediately showed a hint of embarrassment and recounted how he had investigated corruption in Xuanlin City, leading to the Su family's disgrace.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen laughed heartily after hearing this, pointing at Zhu Xuanji, "Brother, you are still the same as ever!" He raised his teacup, "Since I can‚Äôt drink alcohol right now, I‚Äôll just use tea instead." The two clinked their teacups together, treating the tea as wine, both feeling carefree and happy.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen then inquired about Zhu Xuanji's recent circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
After Zhu Xuanji briefly informed him, he set down his teacup, hesitated for a moment, and finally said, "Since you‚Äôre here this time, I‚Äôd like to ask you for a favor." Zhu Zhen immediately patted his chest, "Brother, just say it! Whatever I can do, I will do my utmost!"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji revealed a hint of struggle, opened his mouth, and after a moment of contemplation, he finally spoke, "I want you to help me investigate someone. After all, your investigative methods are much richer than mine." Zhu Zhen quickly waved his hand, "Brother, don‚Äôt say that! You possess the Heaven-Piercing Eyes; what disguise could possibly escape your gaze? Compared to your innate talent, my methods are merely the result of postnatal training."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji shook his head, "To be honest, I‚Äôve been reflecting on myself these past few days, wondering if I‚Äôve been too reliant on my innate talent." "If I were to set aside my talent and my ability to see through lies, do I really have the capability to investigate cases?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen was surprised, as Zhu Xuanji's current demeanor was quite different from his impression of him.<br/>
<br/>
He had never seen Zhu Xuanji so lacking in confidence.<br/>
<br/>
Then, when he heard the person Zhu Xuanji wanted him to investigate, his eyes widened in disbelief, staring at Zhu Xuanji, and asked, "Brother, are you sure?" "You want me, a Golden Core cultivator, to investigate a Qi Refining stage junior?" "Are you serious?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded slowly, his expression serious, "I‚Äôm serious. Just go investigate and give it your all." "Oh, by the way, he‚Äôs shopping nearby right now; I‚Äôll take you to him." At this moment, Ning Zhuo was looking around in a large shop.<br/>
<br/>
To distinguish the specifications of shops in Cloud City was actually quite easy; it depended on the height of the buildings.<br/>
<br/>
The Flying Cloud Kingdom seemed to regard height as a sign of status; the taller the building, the higher the status, and this applied to shops as well.<br/>
<br/>
The large shop where Ning Zhuo was located was one of the tallest buildings in the entire Cloud City.<br/>
<br/>
This shop only sold one type of magical artifact or treasure, which was the Flowing Cloud.<br/>
<br/>
This was a practical item that helped cultivators fly and enhanced their mobility.<br/>
<br/>
The shopkeeper, seeing Ning Zhuo, smiled and proactively promoted their products. "Young master, what kind of Flowing Cloud are you looking to buy?" Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, "Your store has a dazzling array of products; it‚Äôs a bit overwhelming. Could you introduce some to me?"<br/>
<br/>
The shopkeeper replied, "If you simply want to pursue a fast flying experience, I would recommend this classic Flowing Cloud artifact‚Äîthe Somersault Cloud." "The advantage of the Somersault Cloud is that it is very light and agile, making it perfect for beginners. It can turn very sensitively and even roll freely in the air, making it suitable for long-distance travel."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked at the Somersault Cloud.<br/>
<br/>
This type of Flowing Cloud was generally yellow, some resembling egg yolk, while others were duck down yellow.<br/>
<br/>
He picked up a Somersault Cloud and examined it closely.<br/>
<br/>
The Somersault Cloud was not thin and soft like a normal cloud; instead, its surface was quite resilient, like a ball of kneaded dough.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pressed down slightly, and the Somersault Cloud dented; when he released it, it quickly rebounded, showing great elasticity.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo returned the Somersault Cloud to the shopkeeper.<br/>
<br/>
The shopkeeper continued, "If you wish to fly gracefully and showcase your demeanor, then I recommend this Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud."<br/>
<br/>
"This type of artifact flies in the air, displaying a riot of colors and emitting a soft glow, making it very eye-catching. Although its speed is not fast, it is extremely stable. It is said that the Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud can also bring good luck." "Imagine a beauty in distress, facing a dire crisis, and you descend from the sky on this Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud. Haha. With just a little effort, you resolve her difficulties, and she will naturally fall into your embrace. Isn‚Äôt that wonderful?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo chuckled and shook his head again, "I‚Äôll take a look some more." He left the shopkeeper and walked up the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
The higher he went, the better the quality and grade of the Flowing Clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, Ning Zhuo spotted a turquoise cloud.<br/>
<br/>
This cloud had a warm, jade-like color, quietly floating in mid-air, with its mist not dissipating but condensing into a ball.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the Somersault Cloud, which was tightly packed, it still retained a sense of cloud-like lightness.<br/>
<br/>
It was also not as ostentatious as the Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud; its understated blue-green hue caught Ning Zhuo's eye.<br/>
<br/>
After all, he preferred to keep a low profile and had always pursued subtlety.<br/>
<br/>
The shopkeeper, seeing Ning Zhuo, immediately approached with a smile.<br/>
<br/>
However, there was someone even quicker than him. "This is the Azure Cloud, which flies very steadily and reliably, without any bumps at all. Generally, mid to high-ranking members of sects use such Flowing Clouds to showcase their status." "It is said that using it can also enhance one‚Äôs official luck. Of course, I tend to think that this is just a sales tactic set up by the shop."<br/>
<br/>
The person who came to Ning Zhuo's side was none other than Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly saluted and greeted, "Master Zhu." "Master Zhu, you truly deserve to be a divine constable; you know the Flowing Clouds of my Flying Cloud Kingdom like the back of your hand." Upon seeing a Golden Core cultivator arrive, the shopkeeper immediately quickened his pace and his smile became even more radiant.</div>
