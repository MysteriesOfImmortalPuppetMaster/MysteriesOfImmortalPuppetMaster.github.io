<paragraph index="1">At this point, the ghostly giant cultivator feigned casual indifference, yet cast a secretive glance toward Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Before Sun Lingtong could even react, Ning Zhuo’s thoughts swiftly transmitted via their Life Hanging by a Thread.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Sun Lingtong heard Ning Zhuo chuckle lightly: "Boss, just watch. I roughly grasp this fisherman's temperament - just keep praising him lavishly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">Sun Lingtong knew his brother well; since the age of two, Ning Zhuo had excelled at discerning people’s intentions. Even the City Lord’s Mansion and Zhu Xuanji had been spun around in circles by him during the contest for the Lava Immortal Palace, a clear testament to Ning Zhuo’s skill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Sun Lingtong readily complied.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">Sticking out his head to glance at the fish basket, he immediately exclaimed: "Wow! Such a massive fish!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Instantly energized, the ghostly giant straightened up proudly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Sun Lingtong marveled aloud as he scrutinized the peculiar Bone-Crested Carp.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">Its semi-transparent skin revealed its internal organs and bones. Its dark grey bones grew outward from its head, forming robust armor covering its entire body. Every so often, the carp would leap within the basket, and its internal organs would glow with bluish-green flames. Three spikes at the end of its tail stood erect, fiercely stabbing at their surroundings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Sun Lingtong quickly took in these details, continuing aloud: "Magnificent! The bone armor of this carp is rugged, its tail spikes capable of splitting waves, its gills puffed proudly, and eyes shining like stars - truly exceptional!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">The ghostly giant struggled to maintain his composure, feigning modesty: "Truth be told, catching it was mere luck."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Shifting his gaze to the giant’s face, Sun Lingtong praised further: "Brother, to fish something so rare from the Forgotten River, your choice of location must be exceptional. Such keen vision is akin to Bole recognizing a swift steed!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">A hint of satisfaction tugged at the corners of the giant’s mouth before he suppressed it again. "You’ve hit the nail on the head. Good fishing depends greatly on choosing the right spot. Depth matters - there are particular methods for deep and shallow waters, including bait placement and casting techniques."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly: "Though I didn’t see your catch personally, it’s clear that landing such a treasure requires formidable strength paired with peerless fishing skill."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Unable to contain himself any longer, the ghostly giant broke into a broad grin: "Aside from my primary study of military tactics, fishing brings me the greatest joy. Among all the arts of cultivation, this is my strongest suit, and indeed, I’ve invested substantial effort."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">"It’s a pity you weren’t there to see it," he continued animatedly. "When the fish bit, I swung my rod like a sword. As this beast tried to escape with a powerful thrash, I countered with a 'Reverse Onion' martial technique to neutralize its force, and then employed the 'Eight-Character Loop' to channel the water's momentum, encircling it within a narrow radius. After struggling fiercely for half a tea's time, I finally reeled it in."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Sun Lingtong applauded enthusiastically: "Incredible, absolutely incredible!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">His streetwise eloquence quickly identified the giant's love for instructing others. Seizing this, he expressed interest, stating that he wished to learn the fishing techniques, location selection, bait preparation, and precise casting methods.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The ghostly giant’s smile vanished abruptly as he scrutinized Sun Lingtong: "Brother, have you cultivated Forgetful Emotion techniques?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Sun Lingtong’s heart skipped a beat with suspicion: "Why is fishing suddenly linked to some Forgetful Emotion cultivation method? There must be a connection!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Quickly gathering his thoughts, he boldly affirmed his interest, stating clearly that he did indeed wish to cultivate such methods alongside fishing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The giant looked deeply into his eyes: "You've already established your Foundation, yet you still wish to change techniques? Though it’s said one doesn’t regret after forming the Golden Core, switching methods after Foundation Establishment is quite cumbersome."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">"Are you sure you want this?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Sun Lingtong said nothing, responding only with a firm, unwavering gaze.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The giant cultivator sighed deeply: "You too are trapped by affection, then."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">"If you truly desire to cultivate the Way of Forgetting Emotions, it’s an excellent choice."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"But remember, our path is about detachment, not absolute heartlessness. Never go down the path of Severed Emotions - that belongs to demonic cultivation and leads to inhumanity."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong felt amused at hearing this ghost cultivator speak of 'inhumanity', but Ning Zhuo sensed deep melancholy and helplessness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The ghost cultivator continued earnestly: "If you pursue this path, fishing by the Forgotten River complements your cultivation perfectly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">"The emotions and memories troubling us serve as bait for fishing."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">"Whichever emotion or memory we use, it attracts a matching catch."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Suddenly enlightened, Sun Lingtong glanced at the Bone-Crested Carp, realizing the giant cultivator must have used an unresolved obsession as bait.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">"Since fate has brought us together, I can’t lightly impart my main techniques due to sect rules," said the giant. "However, fishing techniques - I can teach you a few."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">He produced three treasures from his storage belt: a spear, a bundle of red thread, and a copper coin, all valuable artifacts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The giant attached the red thread to the spear tip and the copper coin to its other end, handing it to Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">"You must imbue your emotions into the copper coin, then cast it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">"The basic cast is overhead. Against the wind or with obstacles, use side-casts. When fishing near reeds or bridges, swinging casts work best. And for carnivorous fish, skipping the bait across the surface attracts them effectively."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">"But for the Forgotten River, with its wide and clear waters, a simple overhead cast is sufficient."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">“I’ve taught you the overhead casting fishing technique called ‘Azure Edge Wavebreaker.’ This fishing technique possesses a sharp force, capable of piercing the river’s surface and reaching the depths below.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Following this, the ghostly giant detailed the incantation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Sun Lingtong had astonishing comprehension. After listening once, he immediately grasped it, asking several sharp questions that struck at the heart of the technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The ghostly giant answered each query patiently, and soon Sun Lingtong eagerly made his first attempt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Even on his first try, he executed the cast superbly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">The fishing line arched gracefully high above, cutting through the air with a sword-like hum, piercing through the dense, metal-like surface of the river, penetrating straight to its deepest layers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">The ghostly giant looked at Sun Lingtong in surprise: “Brother, it seems you have quite the talent for fishing.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">As he spoke, a sinister wind swept by, stirring the river’s surface into impending turmoil.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Seeing this, the ghostly giant frowned slightly: “Careful, the waves of the river are rising.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Though the riverbank protects us from being swept away, our memories won’t be so lucky.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“Each wave will strip away our most recent memories. You must be cautious!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Sun Lingtong was alarmed: “What?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">But it was too late.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">The next moment, a large wave surged forth, crashing onto the black stone embankment and sending water splashing over Sun Lingtong.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Feeling tense, Sun Lingtong murmured anxiously, “What did I forget? What have I forgotten?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">As the water of the River of Forgetfulness touched his form, it immediately evaporated into thin air without a trace.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Huh?” Sun Lingtong discovered that within his soul, an imprint had emerged clearly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">The Void Seal!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The power of the River of Forgetfulness was absorbed by this seal and vanished instantly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“I… seem to have forgotten nothing?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">“Wait!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">“If I had truly forgotten something, how could I even know?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">“Little Zhuo, Little Zhuo!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Whenever uncertain, Sun Lingtong would call Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Connected by their Life Hanging by a Thread, their spiritual communication was extremely convenient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Ning Zhuo, always attentive, quickly confirmed with Sun Lingtong and found no gaps in his memory.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Is it the Void Seal?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">“Just the seal alone provides such protection. Truly deserving of its reputation as the supreme treasure of a super sect!” Ning Zhuo marveled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Sun Lingtong speculated, “Maybe it’s also because of the accidental absorption of the Evil Void God's marrow in the Thousand Peak Forest that my Void Seal changed.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Regardless, he was safe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo timely reminded him, “The River of Forgetfulness indeed has such properties. Be cautious, Elder Brother. Don’t reveal your secret easily. Perhaps this mysterious ghost cultivator is deceiving you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">“Hmm!” Sun Lingtong nodded inwardly, turning to watch the ghostly giant carefully.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">The giant wiped his face, clearing away the water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Strangely, unlike the river water normally evaporating from living beings, on him, it behaved like ordinary water.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Sun Lingtong’s mind stirred as he guessed secretly: “Could it be due to his Emotionless Cultivation method?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The ghostly giant eyed Sun Lingtong warily: “Who are you?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Sun Lingtong smiled gently: “Brother, we just met, hitting it off at once and having a great chat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“You even taught me your fishing skill, the ‘Azure Edge Wavebreaker’…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Quickly, Sun Lingtong recited the entire technique accurately.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The ghostly giant burst into laughter, relaxing: “That’s right, ‘Azure Edge Wavebreaker’ is my original creation; no one but me knows it.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">“It seems you really are my good friend.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">“Hmm… perhaps I’ve been lonely, fishing alone has been dull. I probably wanted you as a fishing companion.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Have I warned you about the dangers of fishing by the River of Forgetfulness?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">Sun Lingtong nodded: “You mentioned memory loss from the river.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The giant pondered: “I forgot, yet you remember. Clearly, you must have some special protection to dare to approach this river.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Sun Lingtong tensed inwardly, cautiously probing: “Brother, given your frequent fishing here and your strength, haven’t you obtained some artifacts to resist the river’s memory-erasing power?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">“You just gave me three artifacts which I assembled into fishing gear!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">Sun Lingtong waved his fishing rod to emphasize his point.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">The ghostly giant slapped his forehead, laughing: “Haha, no wonder your spear looked familiar! If I gave you these, we must truly have become good friends!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">"It's nothing," he said with a hearty wave of his hand. "I am Luo Si, the Ghost General of Forgetfulness, the top commander under the Lord of the Forgetful River. As for this spear, I can simply fetch another from the armory upon my return. The copper coins and red threads were also gifts from others."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"The reason I am here is quite simple - I fish while absorbing the river's power to forget my past emotions and memories, thereby boosting my cultivation. I'm essentially here to drink from this river!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Upon learning of the ghostly giant's true identity, Sun Lingtong felt deeply astonished. To think his first exploration of the Underworld would introduce him directly to the upper echelon of the Forgetful River!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">He immediately clasped his hands respectfully, "Lord Luo Si, I am Sun Tong. I have just arrived in this honored place. I've heard your mansion has recently undertaken some significant actions?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Luo Si nodded knowingly. "You've been drawn here by the black snow, haven't you? Indeed, recently, many ghosts from afar have been arriving."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">"As for these significant actions you mentioned, do you mean the grand ritual our Lord is personally overseeing, or the siege battle I'm in charge of?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Sun Lingtong seized the opportunity and asked, "I've heard your mansion is assaulting an immortal city in the Yang Realm but has yet to conquer it?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Luo Si clarified calmly, "Indeed, we're attacking it, but don't listen to idle gossip. We've only just begun our siege. How could we possibly be struggling already? It wouldn't truly be difficult unless two or three years pass without success."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">"After all, our target is a renowned immortal city located in the Yang Realm. Many of our abilities and tactics can't be fully deployed there."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Sun Lingtong chuckled softly, "The Yang Realm..."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Luo Si gave him a profound look, "Brother, if you wish to explore the Yang Realm, the Ghostly Black Marshlands are indeed an excellent place."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">"Years ago, there was a Underworld Flood Dragon, incredibly talented and brilliantly insightful. It created the 'Yin-Yang Wheel Sutra,' aiming to defy fate by transforming Yin into Yang. It nearly succeeded during its heavenly tribulation but failed at the last moment, meeting a tragic end due to divine punishment."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">"After its death, its powers reshaped an entire region, forcibly linking Yin and Yang to create a treasure trove of unique energy."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"Our meeting here by the Forgetful River is undoubtedly fated."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">"Given this, I can recruit you into my ranks. Although you won't hold any formal military position, carrying my token will free you from military constraints, allowing you complete freedom."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">These words immediately caused hesitation for both Sun and Ning.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo quietly reminded him, "Be cautious, Brother."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">Sun Lingtong decided to speak frankly, "Brother Luo, I'm merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator, while you're a powerful figure at the Nascent Soul stage. Why offer me a valuable artifact and grant me such convenience at our first meeting?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">If Luo Si claimed it was due to an immediate connection, it would sound far too implausible, especially since he'd just washed away his recent memories in the river.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Luo Si laughed openly, "I don't mind telling you frankly. I died betrayed by family enemies and couldn't even be honored in our ancestral hall, reduced to a wandering ghost. My resentment was so intense it nearly turned me into a monstrous spirit!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">"Fortunately, I met Ash Bone Elder in my confusion. He saved me from losing my sanity completely."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">"I naturally wanted to repay him, and he admitted openly he saved me because he foresaw I would be useful to him in the future."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">"I promised wholeheartedly that I would assist him someday."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">"However, he informed me I needed to pass three fated tribulations before earning the right to aid him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"He taught me my main cultivation technique and guided me to use the Forgetful River for my training."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">"I've received immense help from him but found myself unable to repay immediately due to the length of time required. Thus, I took up fishing, offering all my catches to him as tokens of gratitude."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">"Just recently, he informed me by letter that my first tribulation was approaching and detailed the way to overcome it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">At this, Luo Si paused, recalling the exact words of the message- </paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">'Luo Si, your ambition to exact vengeance in the Yang Realm hinges significantly upon the person you are about to meet. This encounter is pivotal, directly relating to your destined true master. Establish a bond with him, pledge yourself to his cause, and it will greatly benefit your future!'</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
