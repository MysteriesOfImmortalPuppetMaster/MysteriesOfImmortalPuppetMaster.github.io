<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 188: Ning Zhuo's Breakthrough, Three Seas Simultaneously at the Seventh Level!</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Sun Lingtong's silence made Ning Zhuo feel a bit awkward.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly changed the topic, "Alright, let's not talk about this. Let's discuss something serious. Boss, I plan to fully commit to refining a mechanical ape."<br/>
<br/>
"A Golden Core Stage mechanical ape!"<br/>
<br/>
Even though Sun Lingtong had always been a strong supporter of Ning Zhuo, hearing this news made him feel that Ning Zhuo was being a bit too ambitious.<br/>
<br/>
If it were a Foundation Establishment cultivator creating a Golden Core Stage item, it would only be a one-level difference, and there might still be a chance of success.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo was currently only at the Qi Refining Stage, and outwardly, he could only display the cultivation of the third level of Qi Refining.<br/>
<br/>
To leap a whole stage and refine a Golden Core Stage mechanical construct?<br/>
<br/>
"What will you use to refine it?" Sun Lingtong asked directly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo chuckled, "Although my cultivation is a bit low, there are people who can refine it." Sun Lingtong asked again, "Can you get a Golden Core cultivator to help?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shrugged, "Getting a Foundation Establishment cultivator to forcibly refine a Golden Core Stage construct is also possible. I plan to ask the Zheng family for refining, the Ning family for talismans, and the Zhou family for formations."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong thought for a moment and then realized, "You know, you might actually pull this off." He stared at Ning Zhuo with wide eyes, "With your current reputation and connections, you might really make this happen! But if you rely on others for help, won't your mechanical blueprints be leaked?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded, "I've thought about that too. I'll have them each refine some mechanical parts and components. I'll personally handle the key parts and keep them strictly confidential."<br/>
<br/>
"The key is in the materials!"<br/>
<br/>
"Finally, I'll personally assemble them into a Golden Core Stage mechanical construct!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up, suddenly understanding, "Indeed, this is a mechanical construct, not a magical artifact or a weapon. It's not a single entity; it can be disassembled. This is indeed feasible!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo continued, "Moreover, the mechanical ape I envision this time doesn't have any intricate designs. I'll use some classic structures. I'll use almost all the Golden Core Stage materials I have to create this mechanical ape!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo indeed had quite a few Golden Core Stage materials at hand.<br/>
<br/>
Some were accumulated by Sun Lingtong over the years in the black market, some were contributed from Cheng Bai's storage bag, and a third portion was extorted from the Ning family patriarch not long ago.<br/>
<br/>
If any materials were still lacking, Ning Zhuo could trade with the Zhou family, the Zheng family, or even secretly with Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
By now, he was no longer the marginal figure he once was.<br/>
<br/>
Becoming the master of the black market and participating in the joint actions of the three families had already allowed him to leverage multiple resources for his use.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong said, "I've accumulated quite a few good materials over the years as the black market master. I'll take them out for you to refine."<br/>
<br/>
"But how will you give them to others for refining? Have you thought about that?" Ning Zhuo replied, "I've thought about it."<br/>
<br/>
He pulled out a map, spread it out, and pointed to a specific location for Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
"I plan to set up here, destroy the warehouse, and find a large batch of treasures in the underground secret room. Publicly, we'll claim that it's your former treasure trove. What do you think?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong asked some detailed questions and pondered for a while, "These clues and testimonies are perfectly arranged. However, if you suddenly gain such a huge harvest, you must quickly consume these treasures. Otherwise, prolonged possession will easily arouse greed and covetousness."<br/>
<br/>
"I understand, Boss!" Ning Zhuo nodded heavily.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suddenly smiled.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked up, puzzled, "Boss, what's wrong?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong stroked his chin, "I used to look down on righteous cultivators, thinking most of them were hypocritical. But now, seeing you, I suddenly feel that being in the righteous path can sometimes be quite convenient."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, "The righteous path isn't something to be mixed with. I believe it's a positive attitude towards life. Look at those in the demonic path, always fighting to the death. It's too risky and unpleasant. I prefer harmonious coexistence, even if there are conflicts, we can tolerate and bear them, enjoying the beauty of cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo spoke earnestly.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Sun Lingtong realized Ning Zhuo's innocence, understanding that he was just a sixteen-year-old boy.<br/>
<br/>
"Have you thought about it?" Sun Lingtong asked.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo: "Hmm?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong: "After you obtain the Lava Immortal Palace, have you thought about your situation? By then, have you found a way to coexist peacefully with others and other forces?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo fell into deep thought.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's expression turned serious, "Little Zhuo, I understand you. With your nature, you always think ahead. So, what have you thought of?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly, "I'm trying..."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong interrupted, "So, you're using the Life-Hanging Thread to build your own power, hoping to force the various forces in the Immortal City to recognize you as the master of the Immortal Palace through the strength of your family?"<br/>
<br/>
"Heh."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong sneered, "You're too naive!"<br/>
<br/>
"Even I know that this is impossible."<br/>
<br/>
"Whether it's the Ning family, the Zhou family, or the Zheng family, they have no reliable connections in the Southern Bean Kingdom's court."<br/>
<br/>
"The Lava Immortal Palace is such a precious treasure, crucial for suppressing Fire Persimmon Mountain, the foundation of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and its citizens. The Southern Bean Kingdom will never let you control the Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
"Just like the recruitment order said, they will force you to give up the position of city lord and hand over the Immortal Palace before they stop!"<br/>
<br/>
"Don't harbor unrealistic fantasies!"<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo!"<br/>
<br/>
"Since you've embarked on this path, there's no turning back. You must be decisive in killing, or you'll harm others and yourself. If you seize the Immortal Palace in the future, immediately control it and leave here!"<br/>
<br/>
"I know what you're worried about."<br/>
<br/>
"The Fire Persimmon Immortal City's protective formation is capable of continuing to suppress the volcano."<br/>
<br/>
"The Southern Bean Kingdom will undoubtedly take action, as Fire Persimmon Immortal City has many foundations and countless citizens."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's words plunged Ning Zhuo into deep contemplation.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong saw through Ning Zhuo's thoughts and plans, giving the most accurate advice.<br/>
<br/>
The next day.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's residence.<br/>
<br/>
In the underground cultivation chamber.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, wrapped in floating clouds, solemnly took out the Perfect Harmony Talisman.<br/>
<br/>
The Perfect Harmony Talisman was a rectangular strip of paper, its surface like yellow jade, with red edges around the paper.<br/>
<br/>
In the center of the yellow paper was a long string of complex talismans.<br/>
<br/>
The talismans coiled like dragons and snakes, from top to bottom, with three silver rings representing the Upper Dantian's Divine Sea, the Middle Dantian's Qi Sea, and the Lower Dantian's Essence Sea.<br/>
<br/>
A straight line connected the rings, flashing with golden light, resembling a sword or a bridge, piercing through the three rings.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo calmed his mind, holding the talisman between his fingers, placing it in front of himself.<br/>
<br/>
He channeled his mana into the talisman.<br/>
<br/>
The talisman gradually glowed, then spontaneously combusted, quickly turning to ashes.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the smoke and fire, the talisman's radiance swiftly entered Ning Zhuo's chest Qi Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo repeated the process with two more talismans, directing their radiance to the Divine Sea in his brow and the Essence Sea in his abdomen.<br/>
<br/>
After the three talismans were applied, they immediately resonated with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's essence, qi, and spirit each emitted an indescribable aura, slowly flowing, intertwining, gradually merging into one, and finally permeating the other two Dantians.<br/>
<br/>
This process lasted for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea before gradually subsiding.<br/>
<br/>
"The Perfect Harmony Talisman... its effect is indeed remarkable!"<br/>
<br/>
This talisman was specifically used to harmonize the three Dantians.<br/>
<br/>
For a Qi Refining cultivator to break through to the Foundation Establishment Stage, this step was necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Doing so increased the chances of a successful breakthrough.<br/>
<br/>
"But since I cultivate three sects' techniques, I must use the Perfect Harmony Talisman before reaching the seventh level."<br/>
<br/>
"Those who specialize in one Dantian only need one talisman. I need three at once! But honestly, it's very effective."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo carefully sensed the changes, finding that his essence, qi, and spirit now resonated with each other, significantly different from before.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, it was like three people breathing, with uneven breaths, each an independent entity.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the three treasures' auras were interconnected, advancing and retreating together, like three sides of one entity.<br/>
<br/>
To be safe, Ning Zhuo used three more talismans, further harmonizing the three treasures to the utmost degree.<br/>
<br/>
"Now is the time!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face showed determination.<br/>
<br/>
He simultaneously activated three sects' techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Sea‚ÄîMirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Qi Sea‚ÄîFive Elements Qi Regulation Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Essence Sea‚ÄîDemonic Blood Vein Technique!<br/>
<br/>
The three techniques were activated simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
His cultivation, originally at the peak of the sixth level, naturally broke through, officially reaching the seventh level.<br/>
<br/>
Three Seas Simultaneously at the Seventh Level!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo officially entered the late stage of Qi Refining.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, with the three sects' techniques, his overall strength far surpassed that of cultivators at the same level.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been observing Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, the palace spirit's face turned extremely serious.<br/>
<br/>
This little monster!<br/>
<br/>
He possessed innate talent, abundant mechanical expertise, and creative genius.<br/>
<br/>
He held the Immortal Palace's treasure‚Äîthe Buddha Heart Demon Seal!<br/>
<br/>
In the mid-stage of Qi Refining, he had already mastered a complete divine ability‚Äîthe Life-Hanging Thread!<br/>
<br/>
Now, he had advanced to the late stage of Qi Refining.<br/>
<br/>
Fast, too fast!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was filled with admiration, astonishment, and a trace of fear.<br/>
<br/>
It glanced at Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong was also cultivating madly in the training chamber.<br/>
<br/>
Electric light surrounded him, clearly using the divine ability WildSprint Thunderclap to accelerate mana refinement.<br/>
<br/>
"I broke through!" He suddenly opened his eyes, "Haha, the fourth level of Qi Refining." He walked out of the training chamber, immediately receiving countless compliments.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone praised Meng Chong.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so anxious that it kept grinding its teeth, its claws scratching the ground, wanting to shout in their ears, "You fools! Someone has already reached the seventh level, the seventh level!!"<br/>
<br/>
"And you think you're leading?"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was filled with anger and continuous frustration.<br/>
<br/>
It was bound, not free!<br/>
<br/>
It couldn't reveal any information about the trial disciples; its authority was too limited.<br/>
<br/>
As the only spirit aware of the whole situation, it watched Ning Zhuo step by step approaching it, constantly approaching it, and began to feel‚Äîfear!<br/>
<br/>
"Don't come closer, don't come closer."<br/>
<br/>
"Quickly discover him, quickly discover this deeply hidden person!"</div>
