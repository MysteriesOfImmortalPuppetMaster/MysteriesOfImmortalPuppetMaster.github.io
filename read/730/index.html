<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The bottom of the well led to a narrow stone staircase. Following the steps, the pair arrived at an underground cavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The cavern wasn't large, its ceiling hung with numerous stalactites. Patches of faintly glowing moss clung to the inverted formations, casting an eerie pall over the space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">A few figures stood in the shadows or sat on randomly placed stone stools, keeping a wide distance from one another and conversing in hushed tones that echoed faintly through the cavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">The dim, flickering light cast swaying shadows against the rough stone walls, transforming the figures into ghostly silhouettes reminiscent of shadow puppets.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Yu Heye led Sun Lingtong straight to a corner of the cavern.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">There, a figure clad in a loose gray robe, its hood drawn low to obscure nearly its entire face, sat cross-legged atop a flat, massive boulder. No stall or wares were displayed before him; he sat motionless, like a stone statue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">Yu Heye and Sun Lingtong stopped before him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Yu Heye whispered, "Do you have the goods?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The Gray-Robed Cultivator didn't nod. Instead, the space around him shimmered slightly, revealing several floating, grayish-white ceramic urns.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">"The goods are all here," he said.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Yu Heye turned his head slightly to glance at Sun Lingtong beside him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Sun Lingtong had already disguised himself, his height and build indistinguishable from an adult's.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Yu Heye immediately activated his divine sense, probing into the gray jars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">Each jar contained at least one Soul Token.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The Qi Refining-level Souls numbered in the hundreds, crammed into the smallest jars. These Soul Keys were mostly indistinct humanoid orbs of light, their colors dim like gray mist. Within their containers, they stirred and collided unconsciously, emitting silent shrieks, their faces twisted with primal fear and agony.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">Most jars sealed Foundation Establishment Stage Soul Abalones.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Their forms were far more solid than those of the Qi Refining stage, with clearly discernible facial features and even remnants of their former attire. Their colors ranged from deathly pale to faint crimson, their expressions varying from rage to despair to numb resignation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">They struck the jar walls more frequently, their soul bodies fluctuating violently, leaving afterimages within the containers. Some seemed to retain faint traces of consciousness, their hollow eyes staring blankly out of the jars.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">A faint consciousness lingered within, its eyes staring blankly out of the container.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">There was only one Golden Core Stage soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">It was sealed within the largest gray urn, its soul body almost solidified, radiating a faint but distinct spiritual pressure. Crimson red like fire, it was clear this soul had cultivated a fire-attribute Cultivation Art in life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The Golden Core-level soul's eyes burned with intense hatred, so palpable that even Sun Lingtong and Yu Heye felt a chill.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">It remained almost motionless, secretly gathering power, clearly attempting to break free from its prison and reclaim its freedom. Unlike the Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining souls, this one displayed greater strategy and patience.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">After observing for a moment, Sun Lingtong nodded in satisfaction. "Good. I'll take them all."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">The Gray-Robed Cultivator was slightly taken aback.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">Yu Heye, standing beside him, was equally surprised, having underestimated the scale of this transaction.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">"Are you sure?" the Gray-Robed Cultivator asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Sun Lingtong immediately produced a Ghost Path Golden Core and handed it over. "Examine it. We'll adjust the price accordingly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">Sun Lingtong adopted an air of extravagant wealth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">The Gray-Robed Cultivator inwardly gasped, his suspicion growing. "Who is this person? I was merely selling the souls of Golden Core cultivators, yet he casually produces a Golden Core!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">He slowly reached out, accepted the Ghost Path Golden Core, and examined it thoroughly. Confirming its authenticity, he glanced up at Sun Lingtong, his demeanor now markedly changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">He clasped his hands in a respectful bow. "May I inquire as to your esteemed name?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Sun Lingtong smiled faintly. "You may call me Old Sun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Sun Lingtong's disguised appearance was that of a middle-aged man. Even if someone were to see through his illusion and glimpse his true form - that of a young boy - they would likely be puzzled. After all, this image clashed sharply with the title "Old Sun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">This was precisely Sun Lingtong's characteristic style - a blend of truth and deception, leaving others unable to discern his true intentions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">The Gray-Robed Cultivator addressed him respectfully, "Old Sun."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Sun Lingtong nodded slightly, his brow furrowing as he asked directly, "These souls... are they truly all heinous criminals, deserving of death?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">The Gray-Robed Cultivator chuckled. "Old Sun, you worry too much. We wouldn't dare take in or sell souls that didn't deserve to be annihilated - those whose very existence is an insult to the heavens."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">"The Myriad Manifestations Sect is a renowned righteous sect. Trying to peddle innocent souls here would be suicide!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">"For such meager profits, risking beheading? Only a fool would take that gamble!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">Sun Lingtong paused, accepting this explanation. His gaze swept over the struggling souls trapped in their containers. He suddenly asked, "Do you have... a Confucian cultivator's soul?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">"A Confucian cultivator?" The Gray-Robed Cultivator's brow seemed to twitch beneath his hood, his gaze lingering on Sun Lingtong for a moment longer. After a few silent breaths, as if recalling his inventory, he hesitated before finally uttering a single word: "Yes."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">He added, "And... of exceptional quality."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"Oh?" Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Confucian cultivators who turned to the Demonic Path were exceedingly rare. This was because Confucianism, as a cultivation sect, inherently emphasized moral principles and values.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Confucian cultivators emphasize benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness. Consequently, far fewer practitioners defect to the Demonic Path compared to those from the Daoist or Buddhist schools.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Sun Lingtong had come for Ning Zhuo, carrying out Ning Zhuo's wishes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo was now diligently practicing Confucian spells, his cultivation advancing rapidly. He deeply understood the importance of this cultivation in mastering a wide range of skills, ultimately refining his expertise in Mechanism Arts. Naturally, his need for Confucian cultivator souls had grown even stronger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">However, both Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo knew that Demonic Path Confucian cultivators were exceedingly rare. Their expectations were therefore quite low.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">So, when the Gray-Robed Cultivator gave an affirmative response, Sun Lingtong couldn't help but feel a surge of pleasant surprise.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"What's the price?" Sun Lingtong immediately asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">He had already resolved to acquire the soul, even if the price was significantly inflated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">Sun Lingtong was intimately familiar with Ning Zhuo's cultivation progress. The two never concealed anything from each other in this regard. He understood perfectly how crucial a Confucian cultivator soul would be for Ning Zhuo's advancement.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">The grey-robed cultivator paused before speaking. “This one… is somewhat special. I am not yet certain if I can procure this person’s soul to sell to you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">Sun Lingtong frowned. "What's the reason?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">He added, "The price is negotiable."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The Gray-Robed Cultivator didn't immediately respond about the price. Instead, he turned his gaze to Yu Heye beside him. "Actually, many fellow sect members at Myriad Manifestations Sect know about this. He has quite a reputation. His name is... Qin De."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">"Qin De?!" Yu Heye clearly recognized the name, his face darkening with worry and a hint of fear. "Him! The disgrace of the Confucian school."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Sun Lingtong, however, looked utterly puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Yu Heye explained in a low voice, "This man committed a taboo. It caused a huge uproar back then, but the higher-ups have been suppressing the information ever since. Any intelligence you might find through normal channels would have been censored and won't mention him."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Sun Lingtong's curiosity piqued, and he pressed for more details about Qin De's background.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"The Great Sage's Grand Canon?" he asked, hearing the name for the first time. When he heard the name of the Demonic Path Confucian Cultivator's cultivation art, his heart suddenly began to race. His spiritual intuition flared, sending a shiver down his spine.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Sun Lingtong suddenly realized, "This Cultivation Art seems extremely important to me?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Concealing his surprise, he swiftly reviewed Qin De's information in his mind.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Qin De had been a promising young Confucian cultivator, deeply versed in the Confucian classics, exceptionally knowledgeable, and brimming with talent.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yet, perhaps precisely because he had studied so many scriptures, he had created his own Cultivation Art: the Great Sage's Grand Canon of Theft.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">This art linked sages and grand thieves, claiming that the higher a cultivator's moral character and merit, the more formidable their Theft Path Methods would become, granting them massive amplification!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">The art was considered heretical, practically urging all Confucian cultivators to become thieves.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Moreover, the ideas radiating from the Great Sage's Grand Canon of Theft convinced Duanmu Zhang and the Confucian cultivator community that Qin De had fallen into madness, his mind twisted by excessive study, driven to demonic obsession by his reading!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Thus, after all attempts at persuasion, reasoning, and even coercion failed, Duanmu Zhang and the others had no choice but to report to the Sect, defeat Qin De, and imprison him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Qin De had been imprisoned in Cloud Prison for over thirty years.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The Gray-Robed Cultivator recounted Qin De's crimes: after creating his Cultivation Art, he committed several major thefts. The man was indeed a grave criminal.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">But Sun Lingtong had a new concern: "Within the Myriad Manifestations Sect, there are many Confucian cultivators who are fiercely united. What is their view of Qin De?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The Gray-Robed Cultivator chuckled. "Rest assured on that front. Qin De has fallen too deeply into the demonic path, beyond redemption. The Confucian cultivator community completely abandoned him over a decade ago."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"They've even repeatedly proposed destroying Qin De, to eradicate this evil ideology at its source and prevent it from contaminating the orthodox Confucian tradition."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"If you were to eliminate Qin De, I believe the Confucian cultivators would actually be grateful."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Having considered the matter thoroughly, the Gray-Robed Cultivator formally stated his price: "The market rate for a Golden Core cultivator's Soul from Wealth Peak is 300,000 mid-grade spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">"Due to the rarity and unique characteristics of Confucian cultivators, which are seldom seen on the market, I'll add an additional 100,000 mid-grade spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">"Furthermore, securing access to Cloud Prison and navigating the necessary channels will incur significant expenses. Therefore, my total fee is 400,000 mid-grade spirit stones."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Yu Heye's pupils constricted slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">As a Golden Core cultivator himself, he knew this sum was undeniably excessive.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">If it were him, he would never have spent such a massive sum of Spirit Stones just to acquire a single Golden Core-grade Soul.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">But Sun Lingtong simply smiled. "I'll take it. Here's the deposit."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">He produced another Ghost Path Golden Core.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">A chill ran down the Gray-Robed Cultivator's spine. Two Golden Cores in a row... This man is warning me not to cross him! I'd better handle this transaction carefully, or I'll end up like the Golden Core Master himself...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">He accepted the Golden Core. "Very well, Old Sun. Please wait a while for good news from our side."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Sun Lingtong nodded. "Don't deliberately delay. If the goods aren't delivered within a month or two, how will we settle the account? We need this urgently."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The Gray-Robed Cultivator chuckled confidently. "Rest assured, Qin De has long been forgotten. He's been confined within Cloud Prison all this time. If he can't endure it and suddenly dies, that would be perfectly plausible."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">"As Fellow Daoist Yu Heye knows, I've been conducting business here for years. I've always been fair and honest, with reputation as my top priority."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">"I can secure the item within a week at most."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Seeing the Gray-Robed Cultivator's confidence, Sun Lingtong felt even more assured. "Good. In that case, let's sign the contract."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">The Gray-Robed Cultivator nodded without hesitation. This was standard procedure. He was genuinely confident in his ability to deliver.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">He believed it. He had made this kind of deal countless times, and he knew the ropes well.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">Demon Subjigation Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">Within the formation's space.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">The central stone platform.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">The elderly cultivator gazed at Ning Zhuo with satisfaction. "I have one final question."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Ning Zhuo extended his hand. "Please ask, Senior. This junior will answer truthfully, from the depths of my heart."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">In the Upper Dantian of his divine sea, the Buddha-Heart Demon Seal glowed faintly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">The elderly cultivator's voice suddenly deepened, as if carrying the weight of a thousand pounds, pressing down on Ning Zhuo. "Third question: In the fierce competition for the Great Dao, destiny cannot be escaped. If one day you must sacrifice your flesh and blood, burning away your Divine Soul and true Qi, to sever a cataclysmic demonic surge and save billions of lives from annihilation...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">"And after this act, your name, your path, and every trace of your existence might be tainted by demonic corruption, scorned and misunderstood by the world, eternally cast into the abyss of darkness, never to return... Would you still be willing to go?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">Silence hung heavy in the air after this question, as if the very atmosphere above the stone platform had solidified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">The high-ranking cultivators of Zhu Zheng Hall stared expressionlessly at Ning Zhuo, scrutinizing every minute shift in his expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">Ning Zhuo furrowed his brow, lowered his head, and gazed at the stone tiles beneath his feet, lost in deep contemplation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">The cultivators of Zhu Na Hall waited with bated breath. As time ticked by silently, their tension grew.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">The three questions posed by Zhu Na Hall were a hidden assessment, reserved for the most outstanding participants of the first round of the Rising Cloud Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">Among those who answered, the vast majority passed the first two questions, but very few could answer the third.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">This was because the third question was exceptionally rigorous:</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">To sacrifice oneself for death is already heroic. What then of bearing eternal infamy?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">For the sake of the Righteous Path, must one truly sacrifice oneself to such an extreme?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">What is the purpose for which the world pursues justice?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">"It's alright, just answer from the heart," the elderly cultivator said, unable to resist prompting Ning Zhuo after his prolonged silence.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">He feared Ning Zhuo might lie and be detected, leading to his immediate and permanent disqualification. The Demon Subjugation Hall would then be forever closed to him, with no chance of future admission.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">Unbeknownst to them, Ning Zhuo wasn't pondering the question itself, but rather his own predicament.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Ning Zhuo had a clear realization: "With the Buddha-Heart Demon Seal protecting me, they can't detect my true thoughts."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">"I naturally know how to answer to pass smoothly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">"But if I do, I'll almost certainly claim the top spot."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">First place...</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">This would be Ning Zhuo's third first-place finish in the Rising Cloud Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">With this, Ning Zhuo would gain priority qualification, allowing him to exchange his wooden token for a stone token ahead of most participants.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">He would distinguish himself in this first round of the Rising Cloud Trial, joining the ranks of rising stars like Situ Xing!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">Previously, although Ning Zhuo had also passed Che Zhuzi's Rising Cloud Trial with excellent results, Che Zhuzi refused to acknowledge his first-place finish.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">Che Zhuzi intended to use the reward to attract more participants to his Rising Cloud Trial and naturally wouldn't announce it prematurely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">The Rising Cloud Trial could be held in multiple rounds, but the first-place honor could only be awarded once.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">The Demon Subjugation Hall had many branches, but if Ning Zhuo were awarded first place this time, while such Rising Cloud Trials could continue to be held, the honor of first place could never be bestowed upon another.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ning Zhuo stood at the crossroads of three diverging paths.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">Should he emulate Fire Persimmon Immortal City, remaining patient and maintaining a low profile?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">Or should he forgo the immediate opportunity, aiming for first place later - just not in Situ Xing's first round - and tread the middle path?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">Or should he seize the present opportunity, secure his third first-place finish, bask in glory, and stride boldly forward?</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
