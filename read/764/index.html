<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">The cultivators from Profound Armor Cave were astonished to see Ning Zhuo suddenly surrounded and attacked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">"How did these people gather so quickly?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">"What else could it be? This must be the Ban Clan's doing!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">"Isn't Ban Ji a Demonic Cultivator? I've never understood why the Ban Clan would promote a disciple of the Demonic Path to be the face of their clan. The scale of this operation is unprecedented."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">Everyone present understood the situation. Although Zhang Zhixing hadn't explicitly revealed who ordered him to do this, the long-standing conflict between Ning Zhuo and Ban Ji was well-known. They all suspected the Ban Clan was behind it.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The Demonic Cultivator leading the attack wore a grim expression.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">During the Flying Cloud Assembly, the Profound Armor Cave continuously held the Rising Cloud Minor Trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">Since the trial's content remained consistent over time, the Profound Armor Cave used a Formation to randomly select cultivators and notify them at the last minute to participate, preventing large-scale cheating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The cultivators were informed early in the morning. The only exception was Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">When the Profound Armor Cave's higher-ups learned that Ning Zhuo had applied to participate while on the run, and that Ban Ji would also be present, they saw an opportunity for entertainment. They hastily added Ning Zhuo to the Rising Cloud Minor Trial roster.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">After all, watching the drama unfold is human nature.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">This alone proved that Ning Zhuo had been right to reject Ban Ji's offer of reconciliation and even publicly declare his intention to make things difficult for Ban Ji.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">Sometimes, bringing conflicts into the open can yield hidden benefits.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">But now, right under the noses of the assembled cultivators, several of them had colluded to set a trap and harm Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">This undoubtedly showed that the Ban Clan had penetrated the Profound Armor Cave's defenses. Whether through internal agents or by deploying a large number of participants, they had gathered multiple cultivators to overwhelm their opponent through sheer numbers.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">This alarmed the Demonic Cultivator, who thought, "This can't escalate!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">"This is blatant cheating. If the higher-ups investigate, we'll be in serious trouble."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">The Demonic Cultivator had secretly orchestrated this, having previously arranged for Ban Ji to receive the Bronze Saber and Sword.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">The Myriad Manifestations Sect was a righteous sect, and the Profound Armor Cave was a unique faction within it. Both factors demanded that the Rising Cloud Minor Trial be fair, or at least appear fair on the surface.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">But this pre-arranged collusion and blatant cheating clearly violated that fairness.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">Ning Zhuo gripped his Bronze Spear tightly, retreating while sweeping the spear in wide arcs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">The long spear swept aside several bronze weapons hurled at him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">A Mountain-Cleaving Bandit aimed his massive blade at Ning Zhuo, swinging it in a waist-high arc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Before the trial, Ning Zhuo would have had only one option: retreat, retreat, and retreat again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">But now, a glint flashed in his eyes as he spotted an opening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">In the next instant, he surged forward instead of retreating, his left foot stomping the ground with explosive force!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The spear coiled like a dragon!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">Instead of meeting the bandit's attack head-on, Ning Zhuo planted the spear tip on the ground, bending the shaft into a massive arc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">With a flick of his wrist, he released the spear. The tip, propelled by the stored energy, shot forward in a lightning-fast arc, grazing the Mountain-Cleaving Bandit's blade with pinpoint accuracy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Clang!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The heavy bandit was sent staggering backward, his blade crashing against the cave wall, sending shards of rock flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Having dealt with the frontal assault, Ning Zhuo now faced two more bronze weapons flanking him from the left and right.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Blades like wings.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">The bronze saber and sword swirling around him like wings barely managed to deflect the incoming attacks.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">The bronze sword only possessed basic sword techniques, while the bronze saber had a few simple combos. As Ning Zhuo's weakest piece of Profound Armament Armor, it had performed poorly during the siege.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">In contrast, the gauntlets fit snugly against his body, forming Ning Zhuo's tightest line of defense. They had proven remarkably resilient, shielding him from over a dozen strikes in the brief exchange.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The wave of cultivators organized by Ban Jie launched a relentless offensive. Had Ning Zhuo's martial prowess not improved dramatically, he would have been defeated in the initial onslaught.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo parried a heavy bronze mace with his gauntlets, only to face three bronze flying shuttles that immediately followed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">These shuttles moved with blinding speed, each strike aimed at a different, vulnerable angle. Sensing Ning Zhuo's momentary instability, they seized the opportunity to exploit this opening and break through his defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Ning Zhuo's divine sense detected the incoming shuttles, and his heart leaped in alarm. Yet his spear reacted instinctively.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The spear's butt spun twice, striking the shuttles with precise flicks that sent them hurtling away.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">The spear's momentum guided Ning Zhuo's wrist in a fluid motion as he stepped sideways, knocking the final shuttle aside with a decisive strike.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Zhang Wangxing watched this display, his heart tightening slightly. "This kid's close combat skills far surpass mine, but he hasn't reached the Renowned Master realm. He's only holding his own because of that spear."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">"That spear is at the Renowned Master level. It fights without form, guiding Ning Zhuo's movements."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">"Suppress the spear, and victory will be mine!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">With a roar, Zhang Wangxing charged directly at Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">He hurled all five bronze weapons at Ning Zhuo in a ferocious wave of attacks, then surged forward, closing the distance himself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">Ning Zhuo retreated several steps, his spear darting out in precise strikes and sweeping arcs to deflect every bronze weapon Zhang Wangxing had thrown.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Zhang Wangxing's mastery of close-quarters combat was superficial at best. His seemingly ferocious assault was riddled with flaws, easily neutralized by Ning Zhuo. Worse, it severely disrupted his distant allies' coordinated attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Yet Zhang Wangxing had seized the opportunity to close the distance between himself and Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">"Come on, stab me!" Zhang Wangxing roared, charging forward and slamming his chest directly into the spear tip.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">Thwack!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">The spear's razor-sharp point pierced his flesh effortlessly, piercing through his chest and exiting his back.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Agony surged through Zhang Wangxing, blood trickling from his lips, yet he felt a strange exhilaration.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">With a bellow, he gripped the spear shaft with both hands, enduring the agonizing penetration as he continued his charge toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">Ning Zhuo's spear techniques were inadequate; he didn't know how to counter. In the next instant, the spear itself took over, violently shaking and twisting in a wide arc.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The spear's brutal churning tore Zhang Wangxing's wound open, expanding it tenfold. Blood gushed forth, flesh rotting as he channeled his full power. His bones retreated, flesh melting like mud to coat the spear shaft, while his divine sense exerted its full force to suppress the weapon.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Ning Zhuo felt his connection to the spear weakening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Zhang Wangxing's body suddenly collapsed inward, expelling large, viscous chunks of flesh that oozed down the spear shaft toward Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Meanwhile, the cultivators behind Zhang Wangxing seized the opportunity to coordinate their attacks, remotely controlling various weapons to strike Ning Zhuo from all directions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Faced with this onslaught, Ning Zhuo decisively released his grip, temporarily abandoning the bronze spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">"Got him!" Zhang Wangxing exulted inwardly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">He had realized that Ning Zhuo relied heavily on the spear. By seizing it, he could deprive Ning Zhuo of his primary weapon, leaving him vulnerable to a coordinated assault and eventual defeat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Thus, he had been willing to endure severe injuries to execute this tactic.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">A series of sharp clashes erupted as bronze weapons collided, sending sparks flying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Yet all the bronze weapons attacking Ning Zhuo proved ineffective.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">Ning Zhuo's body was almost completely concealed beneath a massive bronze shield.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Zhang Wangxing's eyes widened in fury, his composure shattered. "You actually have a shield?!" he roared.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Shield-type Profound Armament Armor was exceedingly rare.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Yet Ning Zhuo possessed one!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">It was precisely this bronze shield that allowed him to effortlessly defend against the coordinated assault.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">The cultivators refused to relent, continuing their relentless attacks with various bronze weapons.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">But Ning Zhuo maintained an unwavering defense. The shield firmly protected his entire body, and any gaps in his defenses were swiftly filled by bronze sabers, swords, and gauntlets, sealing every opening.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">The cultivators attacked fiercely, but their only gains were chipped and cracked bronze weapons, sparks flying with each strike, yet dealing no real damage.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">"His shield is no joke!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">"Damn it! We were so close to succeeding, and then he pulls out a shield."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">"That kid's cunning. He hid it at first. If we'd known he had a shield, we wouldn't have acted so rashly."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The cultivators communicated urgently through divine sense, but they couldn't devise a way to break through his defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">By this point, Ning Zhuo had weathered the most dangerous initial waves of the siege, successfully establishing his footing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">Shield raised, he even managed to reclaim his bronze spear.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">Zhang Wangxing clutched his chest, urgently tending to his wounds.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">His face was pale. Though the surface wounds healed quickly, the true injuries were severe.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Formation within the Profound Armor Cave now prohibited all healing methods, allowing only the Physical Body's natural regeneration, similar to the second trial.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Zhang Wangxing's recovery ability far surpassed that of the others, but the recent injuries were too severe, leaving his subsequent attacks noticeably weakened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">"Huff..." Cultivator Hao secretly exhaled a turbid qi.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">"Ning Zhuo held his ground! Excellent! Keep it up and defeat these Demonic Cultivators!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Cultivator Hao's stance had shifted; he now secretly supported Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">The cheating had already occurred, and he hoped to minimize its negative impact. Ideally, the consequences would be so minor that the higher-ups wouldn't even bother with a post-incident investigation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">How could he achieve such minimal impact?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Ning Zhuo's victory was a crucial prerequisite.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">If the cheaters won, Ning Zhuo would undoubtedly raise a ruckus. In the eyes of many, Ning Zhuo was no ordinary figure. His refusal of Ban Jie's offer and his escalation of the conflict with Ban Ji had demonstrated extraordinary confidence and backing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="183">Many now speculated that the power behind Ning Zhuo was on par with the Ban Clan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="185">Considering this, Cultivator Hao began to genuinely, albeit secretly, cheer for Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="187">"Damn it! Damn it!" Zhang Wangxing grew increasingly frenzied as the battle dragged on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="189">He was never skilled in close combat. His current strategy relied on using his Demonic Art-enhanced Physical Body to temporarily suppress his opponent's Profound Armament Armor.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="191">But the greatest strength of Ning Zhuo's Three Sects' Supreme Methods lay in control!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="193">Thus, Zhang Wangxing's attempt to forcibly seize Ning Zhuo's weapon was akin to challenging a supreme-grade Cultivation Art with his mid-grade technique.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="195">Each time his attacks were deflected, it was entirely logical.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="197">Ban Ji's eyes blazed with a fierce light as he glared at Ning Zhuo, who was locked in combat.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="199">Having cultivated the Greedy Mechanism Demonic Heart Art, Ban Ji's already avaricious nature had only been further amplified.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="201">Now, his rampant greed fueled his hatred for Ning Zhuo: "That damned thing! How could he be so lucky?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="203">After observing the battle for a while, Ban Ji's eyes were bloodshot with rage. "His saber and sword clashed right from the start. Yet I had to face an opponent with extraordinary power even in the final stages."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="205">"If I had faced his initial circumstances, it would have been a perfect 'heavenly handed' opening!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="207">"And he even has a shield! That's a luxury I could only occasionally dream of when preparing my Profound Armament Armor in the family!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="209">"If I had been given such an opportunity, I could have secured victory against the sixth Bronze Saber with absolute certainty, and even had a good chance against the seventh!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="211">Everything Ban Ji had desperately sought was now possessed by Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="213">His jaw twitched involuntarily as he suddenly transmitted a message via divine sense to the Rust Disaster Craftsman beside him: "Do you think Ning Zhuo's arrival has stolen the opportunities that were rightfully mine?"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="215">The Rust Disaster Craftsman glanced at Ban Ji in surprise, sensing his burning resentment. He couldn't fully understand it, as he was unaware that Ning Zhuo was Ban Ji's Human Tribulation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="217">Noticing Ban Ji's restless intentions, the Rust Disaster Craftsman immediately transmitted a warning: "Ban Ji, restrain yourself. Now is not the time to act!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="219">Ban Ji's eyes flashed with a sharp glint at the reminder, and he suppressed his anger, replying inwardly, "Hmph, I know."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="221">From the moment Zhang Wangxing and his group launched their surprise attack until now, despite the fierce fighting, they had never explicitly stated that they were acting on behalf of the Ban Clan to target Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="223">This was clearly intentional.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="225">The Ban Clan was a prominent force within the Righteous Path, renowned throughout the Flying Cloud Kingdom for generations. Even if Ban Jie had secretly orchestrated the attack, she could never publicly admit that the prestigious Ban Clan would stoop to targeting an outsider just to protect their own prodigy.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="227">The Righteous Path valued appearances above all else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="229">Such an admission would invite widespread scorn, painting the Ban Clan as a mighty family that would stoop to bullying a young Foundation Establishment Stage genius, suppressing a junior with such blatant disregard for decorum.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="231">Moreover, it would tacitly acknowledge that Ban Ji was inferior to Ning Zhuo. Otherwise, why would the Ban Clan need to mobilize such a grand scheme to assist him?</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="233">This was precisely why Ban Jie had orchestrated the situation this way, and why Ban Ji couldn't act directly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="235">If Ban Ji joined the attack, it would be tantamount to admitting the Ban Clan's involvement in the ambush against Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="237">"The clan..." Ban Ji gritted his teeth, forcibly suppressing his urge to act.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="239">The Demonic Path valued unrestrained freedom, but Ban Ji's loyalty to his clan forced him to suppress his natural instincts, leaving him deeply frustrated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="241">At that moment, Ning Zhuo deliberately provoked him further: "Ban Ji, so you've been bribing Zhang Wangxing all along. You've gone to such lengths to set this trap - you must be exhausted!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="243">"Come on, what are you waiting for?!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="245">"Join the attack against me! Let everyone see what the Ban Clan's so-called justice truly looks like!"</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="247">Ban Ji's pupils constricted as he glared fiercely at Ning Zhuo, involuntarily taking a large step forward.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="249">A violent impulse surged from the depths of his heart, driving him to abandon all restraint, join the assault, trample Ning Zhuo underfoot, seize his Profound Armament Armor, and, with his power dramatically enhanced, single-mindedly pursue victory in the Rising Cloud Minor Trial!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="251">Ban Clan Ancestral Hall.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="253">The Supreme Elder guarding the hall suddenly looked up, his gaze filled with shock and suspicion as he stared at the clan's most sacred treasure.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="255">The Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain whirred rapidly, its sliders clattering loudly as the chain abruptly tightened.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="257">After a few breaths, the Supreme Elder's heart jolted. "Something's happening with Ban Ji."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="259">He swiftly formed hand seals, channeling his spiritual energy to fully activate the Clan Destiny Mechanism Chain.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="261">The sacred treasure spun wildly, some sliders even jumping off their tracks. The Supreme Elder, drenched in sweat and gasping for breath, managed to stabilize it. "Finally, I've maintained it."</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="263">Profound Armor Cave.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="265">The jade pendant hanging around Ban Ji's neck suddenly emitted a Pure Light, calming his mind and suppressing the demonic impulse that had been assaulting his defenses.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
