<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 330: Family Division Ceremony</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><html><body><div>
<paragraph index="1">A few more days passed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">The Zheng family’s land — no, it was the Ning family’s branch land now — changed color from a somber white to a fiery red. The gloom and sadness of mourning was swept away, replaced by an atmosphere of joy everywhere.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Ning Zhuo stood on the high platform, first offering sacrifices to the heavens, then to the earth, and finally burning paper money. He lit the incense to inform the ancestors in the underworld that he, Ning Zhuo, would officially split from the main family from this moment onward!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">“Today is the grand ceremony of the division of the family… I have received great help from you all… I am grateful and will remember it in my heart.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">“From today on, as the clan leader, I will be determined to be diligent and dedicated and take the family’s prosperity as my responsibility!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">“Today’s achievements were not achieved overnight, nor could they be accomplished by one person. Here, I especially need to remember the martyrs for the family, Ning Xiaohui, Ning Xiangguo, Ning Xiaoren and many others! They shed blood on the battlefield for the family and protected the dignity and safety of the family with their lives. Although their heroic souls are gone, their spirits live on. We will always remember their kindness and vow to strengthen the family and comfort their souls in heaven…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“…I will inherit the will of the martyrs, remain loyal, and defend the peace of my family. I will never tolerate the evil deeds of the Void Sect and other treacherous people. All evil will be eradicated. I will set an example, forge ahead, and never retreat.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“…My family elders have deep feelings of loyalty. I will never forget them. I will always be grateful and do my best to give back to my family. I will be loyal and serve the City Lord’s Mansion and the Southern Bean Kingdom. I am willing to protect the peace of this place with all my heart.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">“…Thank you all for joining us in this great cause. I hope we can all work together to build our family and achieve great things!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">Ning Zhuo’s inspiring speech excited countless disciples of the Ning family branch, who had all suffered from the oppression of the main branch for a long time.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">There were also guests invited to watch the ceremony, and when they saw Ning Zhuo on the podium, they all had complicated expressions.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">Some were envious, some were jealous, some wary, some disdainful… Behind the main hall of the division family, a grand banquet was set up to entertain guests from all over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The former Zheng family land had a new owner. The Zheng family members were either imprisoned or taken away by the Grand Purity Palace, while the members of the Ning family enjoyed the wine and food here.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">The atmosphere was lively with food and drinks, with sounds of celebration everywhere. However, the cruelty hidden behind this celebration made those who noticed feel cold in their hearts.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">The seating arrangement was carefully designed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">At the main table, Wang Lan sat in the highest position. Ning Zhuo served her, often picking up dishes for her and showing great concern for her.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Wang Lan found the food tasteless, and she began to sob again while eating.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">Ning Zhuo quickly put down his chopsticks and asked gently.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Wang Lan was extremely sad, lamenting that such a beautiful moment was like a dream, but her husband and beloved son fell in the darkness before dawn. She did not enjoy this moment, which made her very sad.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">Ning Zhuo tried his best to comfort her, and his words were like gentle breeze and drizzle, which made the guests who witnessed this scene secretly praise and feel moved.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">At the tables next to the main table were many widows and orphans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">After Ning Zhuo persuaded Wang Lan to stop, he left the main table and personally took Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others to toast each table in turn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">The first table is the neighboring table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">The orphans and widows were worried, so Ning Zhuo announced publicly that the descendants of meritorious officials would not be treated unfairly and that a branch school would be set up to provide free education for these orphans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Such a benevolent policy immediately moved the widows so much that their eyes reddened and they shed tears. One of them took the initiative to kneel down with her children to express her gratitude, and then all the orphans and widows at the table knelt down to express their gratitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“Why must you do this?” Ning Zhuo’s eyes also turned red. He helped them up one by one and sat down again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">The guests praised him highly, saying that although Ning Zhuo was young, he had the demeanor of a master.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">A commotion suddenly burst out, so loud that it attracted almost everyone’s attention in an instant.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">The receptionist suddenly shouted: “The elder of the Ning Family Academy is here to congratulate you!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Then, he recited the gift list: “10,000 top-grade spirit stones, 3,000 kilograms of red sun copper, 136 groups of Foundation Establishment-level earthly evil fire, 80 200-year-old ginsengs…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The gift list is quite long.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">Ning Zhuo quickly stood up, respectfully calling out “Teacher!” as he welcomed the academy elder to the main table.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Among the many elders of the Ning family, the academy elder has the closest relationship with Ning Zhuo. After all, Ning Zhuo had just graduated this year.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">After the academy elder sat down, he took Ning Zhuo’s hand, smiled kindly, and spoke kindly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">Ning Zhuo had no choice but to sit next to the school elder, chatting and laughing.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">Those who didn’t know the truth thought that the academy elder and Ning Zhuo had a close personal relationship. In reality, the academy elder didn’t even teach any of Ning Zhuo’s classes. Ning Zhuo didn’t see the academy elder more than ten times a year.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">The academy elder had come to show goodwill on behalf of the main branch of the Ning family, which Ning Zhuo welcomed. Showing closeness at this moment would also benefit the future of the branch family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Ning Zhuo clearly knew why the Ning family’s main branch changed its attitude.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">He was not aware that Ning Jiufan had punished Ning Qingqiao and threatened the elders of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">The elders who were privy to this matter were all very secretive. Even Ning Jiufan was no exception.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">However, Ning Qingqiao had been stripped of his position as elder, a major event that had to be announced to the public.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Even working together, the other family elders wouldn’t have been able to oust Ning Qingqiao from his position as an elder. Since the patriarch’s position was currently empty, the only one with such authority had to be Ning Jiufan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">Ning Zhuo’s branch family had just been established, and for now, it needed a peaceful external environment. Ning Zhuo secretly thought: “If I want to cause trouble for the main branch, I can do it later. Right now, the most important thing is to let my branch family gain a firm foothold.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">“The ancestor of the Zhou family, Lord Zhou Nongying, has arrived–!” the receptionist shouted loudly, his voice trembling a little.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">After all, Zhou Nongying was a Golden Core stage cultivator, and also one of the two ancestors of the Zhou family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Unexpectedly, the establishment of this Ning family branch had attracted such a respected personage! Everyone at the banquet immediately stood up and prepared to salute Zhou Nongying when he entered.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">The receptionist continued speaking, reading out Zhou Nongying’s gift list.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">“Forty Foundation Establishment-level fire snakes, thirty-two Foundation Establishment-level Spirit Gathering Array Disks, and 446 kilograms of Moonlight Cold Iron!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">Although Zhou Nongying’s gift list was much shorter than what the main branch of the Ning family had given, each and every item was extremely precious.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">This caused the guests to feel even more surprised. It seemed that the Zhou family cared a lot about that youngster Ning Zhuo setting up a branch family! Not only had a Golden Core stage ancestor come to congratulate him, they also sent such valuable presents. They really couldn’t figure out just what was going on.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">It was as if a nobleman had come to a beggar’s party carrying huge sums of wealth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">In the eyes of the public, Zhou Nongying personally attending the celebration alone was enough for Ning Zhuo to brag about for the rest of his life.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">But now, Zhou Nongying had even brought extremely precious gifts!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">“This is really giving Ning Zhuo some face! Hahaha, it seems that this branch family has a bright future.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">“Hmph, what do you know? Ning Zhuo is just a puppet, a figurehead pushed forward to stand on the stage. All he can do is smile and laugh. Zhou Nongying is obviously trying to show goodwill to Ancestor Ning Jiufan.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“You think you’re so smart!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">The guests argued among each other in low voices, but Zhou Nongying never showed up.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">Instead, Ning Zhuo apologetically bade farewell to the academy elder and left the banquet hall. Obviously, he had gone out to greet Zhou Nongying.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">The guests eagerly waited, hoping that Ning Zhuo would bring Zhou Nongying over.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">Unfortunately, no matter how long they waited, he never showed up. After asking around, they learned that Ning Zhuo had already taken Zhou Nongying into a separate room and that he wouldn’t be seated with everyone else.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">Thus, they all sighed in regret.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">In the room, only Ning Zhuo and Zhou Nongying were present. Ning Zhuo straightened his back, and with a polite smile on his face, he thanked Zhou Nongying for his support.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Zhou Nongying had personally participated in the third round of the palace examination and knew about Ning Zhuo’s strength. Everything else aside, Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin and the Night Rain Demon Weapon she wielded were more than enough to strike fear into the two ancestors of the Zhou family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">Zhou Nongying started by praising Ning Zhuo, saying that Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu had both thought extremely highly of Ning Zhuo. He used this chance to make the Zhou family’s attitude crystal clear: They were perfectly willing to get along with Ning Zhuo’s branch family, even moreso than the main branch of the Ning family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">“Unfortunately, the corpses of both Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu are missing.” When Ning Zhuo thought of this, he felt pity in his heart.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">He wasn’t the one who had killed these two rising stars of the Zhou family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">By the time he entered the main hall through the teleportation gate, Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu were already dead. They had perished at the hands of Meng Chong!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Without waiting for Ning Zhuo to speak, Zhou Nongying took the initiative to offer cooperation. He said that the Zhou family would send its most outstanding formation cultivators to modify and upgrade various formations for Ning Zhuo’s branch family, like the formations in the weapon refining rooms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">Ning Zhuo immediately had a pleased expression and expressed his agreement, saying that cooperating closely with the Zhou family was something that everyone in his branch family was looking forward to.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">There was no one who didn’t know about the Zhou family’s skills in formations. Once upon a time, the Zheng family had offered a high price for the Zhou family to come and improve their formations, but the Zhou family refused.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">After all, doing such a thing would be extremely beneficial for the Zheng family. If the formations in the weapon refining rooms were improved, the family would quickly become much stronger!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Now, Zhou Nongying had taken the initiative to cooperate with Ning Zhuo on this matter, fully displaying the sincerity of the Zhou family.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Ning Zhuo knew very well what was going on here. “On the one hand, it’s because my military might is high enough that they can’t treat me as a mere Qi Refining cultivator anymore. On the other hand, with the Meng family now in charge of the Lava Immortal Palace, the Zhou family are the ones under the greatest pressure. They desperately need allies to stand against the Meng family.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">After the conclusion of the Lava Immortal Palace incident, all of Fire Persimmon City was undergoing drastic changes. The Zhou family was worthy of being an ancient family; they had already taken action to proactively respond to these changes.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">While Ning Zhuo was busy speaking with Zhou Nongying, the receptionist’s voice suddenly sounded out again.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">“Master Fei Si from the City Lord’s Mansion has arrived.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Fei Si, too, had brought many gifts with him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">The guests at the banquet were once again delivered a great shock.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">Compared to Zhou Nongying, Fei Si, who was a capable subordinate of City Lord Meng Kui, was a true big shot who held immense sway over the city.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">And such a big shot had actually come in person to congratulate Ning Zhuo!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">“Am I hallucinating?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Unbelievable!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">“Just what kind of abilities does that youngster Ning Zhuo have?!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">Of course, Fei Si wasn’t seated in the banquet hall, either. Ning Zhuo had no choice but to temporarily stop his conversation with Zhou Nongying and go out to greet him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="169">Zhou Nongying laughed coldly in his heart, but spoke with a smile on the surface. “Let’s go together, go together.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="171">When Fei Si saw Ning Zhuo and Zhou Nongying walking over side by side, he smiled meaningfully. “Patriarch Ning Zhuo, it seems that I’ve disturbed you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="173">Ning Zhuo bowed in greeting, thanking Fei Si for helping him in the past.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="175">Fei Si’s eyes narrowed. Looking Ning Zhuo up and down, he sighed, “Patriarch Ning Zhuo, you’re too kind. Even without my help, your strength would have been enough to overcome all kinds of difficulties. It was I, Fei Si, who failed to recognize a hero!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="177">He was speaking genuinely.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="179">Fei Si had been completely taken aback when he heard the truth from Meng Kui. He had never expected that a young man like Ning Zhuo had hidden so deeply and plotted so viciously. It could almost be said that Ning Zhuo had singlehandedly brought about an end to the entire Zheng family!</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="181">Fei Si admired Ning Zhuo more and more, but at the same time, he became extremely wary.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
