<paragraph index="1">At the Little Contention Peak, Martial Arts Arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="3">Disciples of the Myriad Medicine Sect were guarding the entrance to the martial arts arena. They carefully checked the identities of those entering and collected entrance spirit stones before allowing cultivators inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="5">Due to the fierce competition at Little Contention Peak, the martial arts arenas were always in high demand throughout the year.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="7">A cultivator approached the disciple at the entrance with a smile, asking, “Are there any vacancies in the martial arts arena?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="9">The disciple glanced at him indifferently, “You again? Last time, I clearly told you that the martial arts arena is fully booked until the end of next month.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="11">The cultivator nodded and lowered his voice, “I know, but I’ve heard it’s possible to jump the queue if…”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="13">“Stop!” the disciple immediately interrupted him. “What you're talking about did exist, but that was during the previous management. Ever since I took over here, no one has been able to cut the line.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="15">“You want to bribe me?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="17">The disciple shook his head, firmly refusing, “That won’t work!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="19">“Hm?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="21">Just as they were speaking, the disciple's expression suddenly changed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="23">He hurried forward, respectfully bowing, “Sister Lin, what brings you here?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="25">The disciple was a bit puzzled.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="27">After all, someone like Lin Shanshan usually only used the martial arts arenas on the main mountain of the Myriad Medicine Sect, where the facilities were much more advanced. It was rare to see her at this smaller venue.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="29">Lin Shanshan looked slightly flustered but quickly composed herself. “Give me a martial arts arena. Are there any available?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="31">“Of course!” The disciple immediately patted his chest. “You’re in luck, Sister Lin. There just happens to be a vacancy in one of the arenas.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="33">Lin Shanshan nodded, trusting him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="35">“Who is this young man who dares to spar with Sister Lin?” The disciple glanced at Ning Zhuo, unable to gauge the young man's background.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="37">Noticing the look, Ning Zhuo slightly nodded at the disciple, who smiled in return.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="39">“Right this way, Sister Lin,” the disciple led them inside.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="41">As they passed the earlier cultivator, the man stepped aside with envy in his eyes, watching them enter the martial arts arena.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="43">“The fact that I’m seen with Lin Shanshan will certainly spread,” Ning Zhuo thought, pleased with the outcome.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="45">In fact, one of his goals in inviting Lin Shanshan to the arena was to generate this kind of buzz. Being new to the area, he naturally wanted to align himself with someone influential. Lin Shanshan was undoubtedly a good choice.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="47">Everything was going according to Ning Zhuo’s plan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="49">Along the way, the disciples they passed all greeted Lin Shanshan and cast curious glances at Ning Zhuo. Even many of the visiting cultivators noticed them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="51">“This is the first time I’ve seen Lin Shanshan bring someone else to use the arena.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="53">“Who’s the young man with her? I’ve never seen him before.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="55">“Judging by his bearing, he’s not simple. He must be a high-ranking disciple from another major sect, probably on par with Sister Lin.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="57">These comments reached Lin Shanshan’s ears, making her ears burn.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="59">Once they entered the martial arts arena, Lin Shanshan said to the disciple, “You can leave now. I’ll manage things from here.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="61">The disciple hesitated briefly, sensing Lin Shanshan was eager to be alone with the young man. The disciple, much older than Lin Shanshan, had never seen her behave this way with a stranger before.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="63">“Could it be…” The disciple considered a certain possibility but quickly shook his head, dismissing the thought.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="65">Lin Shanshan, the beloved daughter of the Myriad Medicine Sect's leader, was adored by everyone in the sect. Many cultivators secretly admired her, though the disciple harbored no such feelings, viewing her more as a younger relative.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="67">Lin Shanshan activated the martial arts arena’s formation, instantly isolating the interior from the outside world.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="69">She exhaled softly, her tension easing slightly.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="71">“Strange, I’ve entered martial arts arenas many times with my Senior Brother, but why do I feel so nervous and flustered this time?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="73">Ning Zhuo remained silent, observing the arena and giving Lin Shanshan time to compose herself.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="75">Once Lin Shanshan calmed down, she said, “Young Master Ning Zhuo, please show me your combat techniques so I can understand your capabilities. It’s like diagnosing a patient - you must know the symptoms before prescribing the right treatment.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="77">Ning Zhuo nodded and immediately demonstrated several Five Elements techniques.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="79">Currently, his main combat strength relied on his mechanical constructs.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="81">The Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Meng Yaoyin, the Night Rain Demon Weapon, the Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, the Floating Ice Jade Hands, and the Ice Snow Weather Sphere - these constructs were powerful enough for Ning Zhuo to challenge even Golden Core cultivators.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="83">Relying on these constructs, Ning Zhuo’s combat strength far exceeded his Foundation Establishment stage, reaching the level of a Golden Core combatant. However, he wasn’t going to use his constructs or reveal his true strength to Lin Shanshan just yet.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="85">On one hand, he wanted to use the Little Contention Peak to hone his skills. If he used his constructs to crush Foundation Establishment cultivators, the training value would be minimal. On the other hand, he needed an excuse to keep interacting with Lin Shanshan. Displaying too much power might make her wary.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="87">By showing relative “weakness,” it would be easier for him to execute his plans.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="89">Ning Zhuo demonstrated several Five Elements spells, all of which were highly proficient.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="91">Lin Shanshan’s eyes lit up in admiration, “I didn’t expect Young Master Ning Zhuo to have such mastery of spells! You’ve even surpassed me. With your abilities, you stand a good chance against Han Zhou.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="93">Ning Zhuo's skillful use of Five Elements spells impressed Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="95">What amazed her most was how naturally and seamlessly Ning Zhuo transitioned between the different elements, an uncommon feat for someone of his age.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="97">“You’re really only sixteen?” Lin Shanshan couldn’t help but ask.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="99">Ning Zhuo smiled and confirmed.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="101">Lin Shanshan sighed, “It’s not that I don’t believe you, but such spell mastery at sixteen is truly extraordinary!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="103">“I’ve only heard of two or three people like you.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="105">“To see one in person today is truly remarkable!”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="107">Ning Zhuo's modest display of power piqued Lin Shanshan’s curiosity further.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="109">She asked, “Are you a battle cultivator?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="111">“Since childhood, apart from accumulating mana, how much time have you spent practicing these spells?”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="113">Ning Zhuo thought for a moment before replying, “I haven’t invested too much time in these spells. I’m actually more interested in mechanical techniques than spellcasting.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="115">“Besides casting spells, I can also use mechanical hands to assist me in battle. Allow me to demonstrate.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="117">Ning Zhuo retrieved six mechanical arms from his storage belt.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="119">The arms floated in mid-air, circling around Ning Zhuo.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="121">He commanded them to cast various elemental spells - metal, wood, water, fire, and earth - all at once, creating a dazzling display of power and danger.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="123">Lin Shanshan instinctively stepped back, shocked by the ferocity of his attack.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="125">Ning Zhuo quickly retracted the mechanical arms.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="127">“I’m more skilled at long-range spellcasting,” Ning Zhuo explained. “But I’m worried about being caught off guard in close combat. If I get entangled in close quarters, I’ll be at a disadvantage.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="129">Lin Shanshan nodded, “Let’s try a sparring session, then.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="131">Ning Zhuo and Lin Shanshan engaged in a close-combat bout, with Ning Zhuo fully utilizing his martial skills. However, he was suppressed throughout the entire match by Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="133">“Alright,” Lin Shanshan said, stepping back to create distance between them.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="135">Ning Zhuo, out of breath and pale-faced, nodded.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="137">“Do you know how to use weapons?” Lin Shanshan asked.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="139">Ning Zhuo shook his head, “I’m not proficient with any.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="141">Lin Shanshan smiled, “Compared to your spells, your close-combat skills are indeed lacking.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="143">Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly, “Miss Lin, you’re being too polite. I’m well aware of my shortcomings in this area. Please don’t hesitate to criticize.”</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="145">Lin Shanshan, five years older than Ning Zhuo, had been trained rigorously by her father, Lin Bufan, since childhood. As his only child, she had received the best guidance.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="147">Lin Shanshan’s spellcasting skills were close to Ning Zhuo’s, but in martial combat, she was far superior.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="149">Ning Zhuo, on the other hand, was mostly self-taught. Even though he attended academies, he received standard education rather than specialized training like Lin Shanshan, who had been nurtured by a Nascent Soul expert from birth.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="151">As a result, while Ning Zhuo’s foundation was solid, it was still average compared to a sect prodigy like Lin Shanshan.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="153">Of course, if Ning Zhuo unleashed his constructs, even ten Lin Shanshans wouldn’t be enough to defeat him.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="155">“Please teach me martial combat!” Ning Zhuo asked directly, without reservation.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="157">He had long recognized his weakness in this area.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="159">It wasn’t that he had been wasting time in the past sixteen years - he had been training diligently every day. However, his focus had been on mechanical techniques rather than close-combat skills.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="161">During the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace, when he encountered combat puppets, he realized the need to improve this weakness but hadn’t had the time to do so.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="163">“Hmm…” Lin Shanshan hesitated.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="165">The Buddha Heart Demon Seal’s lingering influence made her feel that this request was a bit too forward. After all, teaching martial skills often required close physical contact, something inappropriate between men and women.</paragraph><br/><br/>
<paragraph index="167">When Lin Shanshan reached a certain age, both Senior Brother Linghu Jiu and her father, Lin Bufan, stopped personally instructing her and instead arranged for female teachers to take over her martial training.</paragraph><br/><br/></div></body></html></div>
